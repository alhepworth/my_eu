To achieve this objective we turn to design thinking methodology, which proves to be extremely useful because it can be thought and learned in a relatively short period using controllable process with evaluations and exercises to improve creative efficiency. We perceive it as a powerful tool that could easily be applied for improving achievements and strengthening quality of the teaching process in higher education.\r\n\r\nHaving considered the above mentioned, in the course of the project we will develop a number of ICT-supported didactic materials that will introduce the design thinking approach to higher education, considering:\r\n- improving the ability of the higher education to influence students\u2019 individual potential and equip future graduates with knowledge and core transferable competences they will need to succeed in high-skill occupations (including flexibility, creativity, team work abilities, communication skills, etc.);\r\n- strengthening the researchers and academics\u2019 willingness to engage into interdisciplinary endeavors in general and to include design thinking and interdisciplinarity into the teaching process in particular;\r\n- increasing the HEIs\u2019 management staff awareness, openness and support for introducing continuous changes at a university (including a shift towards interdisciplinarity) for making it more respondent to the changing needs of the labour market and more efficient in defining the competencies of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe project also creates a possibility to develop, test and evaluate a new, flexible and innovative didactic approach.

Douglass, 2016, The New Flagship University, Palgrave Macmillan, p. xiii). Therefore, quality assurance (QA) and enhancement in higher education institutions (HEIs), in particular in learning and teaching (L&T) is more important than ever which immediately implies that a need for systematic performance (core) data, performance indicators and Learning Analytics exists. These will allow to balance various stakeholders' requests for 'Smarter Universities' and comprehensive (Digital) Performance Data Management (DPDM), i.e., (digitised) performance monitoring and evaluation including profile-driven quality enhancement and evidence-based strategic governance. \r\n\r\nThe SQELT project aims at establishing a comprehensive L&T core dataset (LTCD) for assessing HEIs' performance quality in L&T. The LTCD shall be based on the general criteria of empirical reliability and relevance for quality enhancement and strategic governance; it shall include data definition, data formats and software-adequacy; operationalization capacity shall be analyzed at least for important selected core data. LTCD includes generic core data relevant to any HEI. At the same time, LTCD will be part of a toolbox from which HEIs can select 'individual' performance data according to their specific strategic profile, mission and vision. The SQELT project will also attempt to identify ('construct') related performance indicators. The integrative LTCD shall be prepared for its use in DPDM, in particular Learning Analytics, including an ethical code of practice. \r\n\r\nThat way, the SQELT project will contribute to the \u2018Research on Indicators of Teaching Quality\u2019, and thus to what was recently recommended to the European Parliament: \u2018In order to strengthen the role and weight of teaching and learning in international rankings, more research on adequate and internationally comparable indicators for the quality of teaching appears desirable, even necessary. [\u2026] Should it be possible to define a set of usable key indicators, the next step would be the creation of a global data collection and feeding into an international database, to be run by trusted international actors, like the EU, the OECD or the UNESCO\u2019 (W\u00e4chter, B. et al., 2015, University Quality Indicators: A Critical Assessment. Directorate General for International Policies, p. 78). The results of the SQELT project shall help to ensure HEI stakeholders get maximum benefit from LTCD and DPDM. To this end HEIs should use systems that are designed in consultation with stakeholders; supported by an ethical code of practice; driven by the improvement of performance processes and stakeholder engagement; 'tailored to the particular needs of each institution; embedded in an institution\u2019s strategic plan\u2019 (Higher Education Commission, 2016, From Bricks to Clicks. The Potential of Data and Analytics in Higher Education, Policy Connect, p. iii).\r\n\r\nThe main target groups of the SQELT project are HEIs' actors in L&T and stakeholders interested in L&T quality enhancement - students, parents, employers, HE politics, QA agencies. The SQELT project intends to include as many of these as possible. Since SQELT has the character of a pilot project with limited capacities, however, the focus will pre-eminently be on HEIs including students, teaching staff and internal QA, and secondly on QA agencies and HE politics. \r\n\r\nThe SQELT project builds on available models of DPDM in L&T, an analysis of current literature, own DPDM models and practice of project participants, external experts\u2019 knowledge, and surveys with the project's HEI partners about their assessments of relevance and actual use of performance data and indicators.

To allow a broader access to university, more diverse applicants (i.e. with more diverse academic knowledge and skills, from diverse national, cultural/ linguistic backgrounds, with diverse levels of maturity/ work experience) need to be addressed more clearly.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES of this project are twofold. First, the project aims to raise awareness among actors at Higher Educations Institutions (HEIs) for the importance of Diversity Management (DiM), enhance their corresponding competences and implement means to ensure sustainability of taken measures. Second, the project aims to improve study conditions and thus reduce drop out and foster student success.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s TARGET GROUP are Programme Leaders (PLs) as they are the main decision-makers in their own programmes and have the capacity to adapt their curricula to contemporary needs.  Additionally, they dispose of formal as well as informal power to find strong support for the implementation of diversity-sensitive practices on an institutional level.  They have influence on their subordinates (teaching staff, administrative support personnel) and can highlight the benefits of an inclusive DiM approach. Since they require a sound intake of students they have a keen interest in communicating effective DiM strategies to their faculty for the benefit of all involved agents (teachers, students, administrative staff) as well as for the whole HEI (competitive advantage from a marketing, teaching, learning and service perspective). \r\n\r\nSo far, PLs seem to be poorly prepared to ensure student success for a more diverse student population. In addition, their study programmes and curricula do not sufficiently meet inclusivity demands. To counter-act these drawbacks, this project aims to improve PLs DiM competences in a specifically designed DiM training. PLs will be trained to be able to design inclusive curricula and classroom settings that manage diversity from a more holistic angle (incorporating demographic, cognitive, disciplinary, functional and institutional diversity) to improve student attainment for an increasingly diverse student body. Finally, a DiM trained PL acts as role model and is able to influence both administrative and teaching staff.\r\nSecond, the project aims to support PLs in their leadership responsibility. By providing DiM tools and supportive means PLs get equipped to handle diversity. In this view, developed web-based trainings can be passed on to their administrative and teaching staff to raise awareness of the importance of the social dimension and DiM. In addition, materials and tools (incorporated in a specially designed toolbox) can easily be accessed to improve DiM competences and support staff to better meet the challenges of the social dimension in their daily working routine for the benefit of their study programme and all students.\r\nFinally, these measures should bring the participating partners\u2019 social dimension strategies to life and foster organisational development and social dimension mainstreaming. In this vein, the developed training program is supposed to be integrated in the institutions\u2019 staff trainings. All in all, the diversity-sensitive measures taken are meant to positively impact success of ALL students, reduce student drop out and enhance graduate employability.  In the medium term, the effect of the developed outputs will be measured via a specifically designed DiM self-assessment questionnaire.  \r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of four partners:\r\nUniversity of Applied Sciences Upper Austria brings in core values of interfunctional team work as well as means to facilitate cooperation among team members with conflicting interests. \r\nBirmingham City University (UK) brings in extensive working knowledge in demographic diversity, particularly disabilities, ethnical/religious/ linguistic background, age, social mobility.\r\nDue to their wide range of differing disciplines and their numerous interdisciplinary projects Technische Hochschule K\u00f6ln (Germany) addresses extensive working knowledge in disciplinary diversity.\r\nLaurea University of Applied Sciences (Finland) has a specially designed teaching model called \u201cLearning by Developing\u201d which allows flexible and appreciative ways for studying.

It is well known that this is a key issue that leads young people back into the spiral of offending.  Experience indicates that whilst many businesses offer opportunities to the very vulnerable, it is often difficult for them to sustain the offer.  This is because the issues facing the young people affect most, if not all, of their behaviour. Employers often do not know how to deal with what is perceived as poor behaviour and the default is to make them redundant. Employers need proper training to equip them for appropriate action to address issues with vulnerable young people. Where such transitions are made and apprenticeships are successful, we need to be explicit about what works and what does not. There is patchy and often anecdotal evidence but little substantial evidence-based work. The common theme emerging from existing work and experience is the need for social support: just getting someone a placement without an eye on the social support for a range of other issues is thought not to work by many professionals in the field. A web of support is therefore increasingly regarded as essential for helping the most vulnerable young people become constructive members of society.  There are indications that there is a need for common but multifaceted approach to supporting vulnerable young people through vocational education, training and apprenticeships. \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe key objectives are: 1) to explore the experiences of young people; 2) to identify the needs of employers; 3) to identify the needs of schools and VET trainers; 3) to map good practice; 4) to bring together practitioners; 5) to provide a model of evidence based social support requirements; 6) to share good practice beyond the immediate partnership.\r\n\r\nTarget group.\r\nThe direct beneficiaries of the project are VET providers, including both trainers/colleges and employers that provide apprenticeships and work placements for young people. In particular, there will be a focus on organisations that wish to give particular attention to vulnerable young people. This includes private companies; public bodies; social enterprises that aim to improve the lives of the vulnerable; NGOs that provide VET for their clients; schools that provide VET; prisons that provide VET to young offenders; local authorities who are often responsible for co-ordinating and providing VET.\r\n\r\nThe indirect beneficiaries of the project are the most vulnerable young people in society. We are using a broad age range from 16 to 25 in order to capture different definitions of \u2018young people\u2019 that are used across Europe.  Vulnerabilities relate to a wide range of often inter-related issues such as histories of violence and abuse, problematic drug and alcohol use, serious undiagnosed mental health issues, problematic family relationships, experience of offending and prison. This group includes young people from different ethnic origins, such as Roma; and includes young people who are migrants. Some of the most vulnerable young people are women who at particular risk of domestic violence, sexual abuse and sex work.\r\n\r\nExpected impact\r\nUltimately, the key impact will be on the lives of the most vulnerable young people in our society.  Successful apprenticeships enhance the lives, confidence, social and cultural capital of those young people and can help turn broken lives around, with attendant benefits for future generations.  For the VET providers, and in particular, employers, this project will raise awareness of the needs of these young people and also signpost them to appropriate support.", "http://www.bcu.ac.uk", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013612_coordinator"], [2014, "Business Education for Sustainability: Teaching Corporate Social Responsibility and Social Entrepreneurship for Sustainable Local and Regional Development", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", 289557.0, 7, 10, "In response to the effects of the economic crisis, curtailed public budgets and the magnitude of future challenges, social entrepreneurship and corporate social responsibility (CSR) emerge as a key policy priority in the EU. They are sources of social innovation and a contributing factor to building up the innovation capacity and competitiveness of EU economies. This turns them into increasingly critical elements of the EU development strategy. Yet business and economics education and training does not adequately reflect this trend.\r\n\r\nThe interdisciplinary academic field of social entrepreneurship is not well developed in the EU. The term itself is often understood poorly or narrowly. The study of CSR is limited in terms of academic hours and content. The project is built on the rationale that for business to be motivated and able to achieve a social impact, the very content of CSR and Social Entrepreneurship as subjects in education would need to develop and business education needs to grow more responsive to what have until now largely been public agendas for dealing with the pressing challenges facing society. \r\n\r\nThe project has the overall objective to promote cooperation and exchange of good practices among relevant organizations from 7 Programme countries (Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, UK), in view of enhancing the quality and relevance of education in the field of social entrepreneurship and CRS, fostering social innovation and supporting the social impact and responsibility of business.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n- to support research and best practices exchange in the field of social entrepreneurship, social innovation and corporate responsibility, in view of making business/economics education more relevant to sustainable regional and local development;\r\n\r\n- to initiate cross fertilization between business/economics studies and sustainable development studies in order to develop an innovative curriculum that fully integrates the subjects of social entrepreneurship and CSR into business/economics and entrepreneurship education;\r\n\r\n-  to develop a model certification procedure allowing business to evaluate and certify the skills of volunteers that contribute to CSR initiatives;\r\n\r\n- to maximize the impact of the integrated innovative curriculum by demonstration initiatives, training of trainers and the development of a pilot e-learning platform for training in CSR and Social Entrepreneurship;\r\n\r\n- to contribute to the promotion of social entrepreneurship and corporate responsibility among business, society, media and education providers.\r\n\r\nThis project is a partner initiative involving 7 Higher Education Institutions, a NGO and 2 institutions providing non-formal education and professional training. \r\n\r\nThe activities of the project include development of intellectual outputs, transnational project meetings, sustainability activities, dissemination activities, a joint training of staff, and evaluation activities.

Democracy is in a crisis and this has led to a crisis of engagement on a number of levels. \r\nThe project aims at addressing the need for a systematic approach to Civics education and the teaching of Democratic practice by offering trusted high quality content (learning scenarios, lesson plans, etc.), enriched by drama techniques and tools that help the teaching community improve their methods and engagement with pupils. The approach will be evaluated in terms of its impact, paying particular attention to the effectiveness of institutional and pedagogical change and innovation through drama.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nSix participants are involved in this project. This is a consortium rich in diversity and expertise. BCU the lead UK partner has a long and successful tradition in training secondary Drama teachers and brings a rigorous training dimension to the project.  The Drama department of Heartlands Academy has a close relationship with the Drama department of BCU and will provide the educational platform (students and teachers) for experimentation and modeling of dramatic materials. It will host workshops and will lead practice.  InSite was part of the successful EU Lifelong Learning Programme DICE (2010) and this project is a natural successor to the DICE project. Ellinogermaniki Agogi has worked with BCU successfully in EU projects before. Their experience of ICT is something partners are keen to exploit and also their knowledge on developing schools of the future. The University of Rome brings the Italian experience of a new \u201chumanistic  model\u201d of education that claim the development of empathic capacities that are essential for a successful democracy. and significant experience in a different dramatic model to the one suggested by BCU and InSite that aids inquiry into the phenomenology of human expression. The Children's Rights Knowledge Centre (KeKi) our Belgian partner has an extensive expertise in the development of citizenship for children and young people in different contexts, both within and outside the educational setting. \r\n\r\nDescription of Activities\r\nThe project will develop a 100 hour foundational, blended learning training course with an e-book that offers an innovative novel and practical integration of three areas: 1. evidence-informed practice in philosophy for/with children; 2. interpretative approaches to education about civics education; and 3. drama-based methodologies. It will provide a. transferable skills that can be adapted across the educational spectrum, b. enhance teachers' abilities to facilitate and support enquiry, c. creating the conditions for teachers of languages, humanities and drama practitioners to engage young people in discussion and analysis of complex issues, concepts, beliefs and values, and d. ensuring the participation, voice, and inclusion of all students through teacher-training. \r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nWe have formed a partnership which brings a huge array of talent and experience to this project from different settings across Europe. We plan to have lead organisations covering topics relevant to their strengths and for transnational meetings to be used to exchange practice and develop frameworks and content for our products. All our outcomes will be available through on line resources which are free to use. \r\n\r\nResults/Impact\r\nAt a local and regional level, the project is intended to have a direct impact on secondary teachers who will participate in the training activities and in multiplier events. Given that the aim of the project is to enhance teachers' capabilities to facilitate civic engagement through the use of various drama methodologies, it is expected that teachers will disseminate the outputs and overall messages to other teachers in their schools and their wider networks. These actions are intended to have impact on those participants directly involved in the activities, as well as those indirectly involved, their students, who will participate in classroom activities informed by this facilitated model and other stakeholders concerned with the relevant questions, pedagogical strategies and curricular content addressed in the project. There will be an attempt to communicate the outputs from the project to institutions responsible for curricula design in Initial Teacher Education in the UK and Italy. As BCU and University of Rome are both directly involved in the training of teachers, the consortium aims to incorporate the final outputs of the project in future courses in these third level institutions. At a National and European levels, the partners will make use of the ODS and contacts from European networks and associations in education.", "http://www.bcu.ac.uk", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036559_coordinator"], [2017, "Open School Doors - Developing diverse school / parents communities through innovative partnerships", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", 205316.0, 5, 6, "\u201cInclusion is a sense of belonging: feeling respected,\r\n                                                                                                                                             valued for who you are; feeling a level of supportive energy\r\n                                                                                                                                  and commitment from others so that you can do your best work.\u201d\r\n                                                                                                                                                                            (Miller, Frederick A. and Katz, Judith H. 2002)\r\n\r\nOpen School Doors, following the findings of EU report (2010/2011) tackling the issues of equity and social cohesion, aims at enabling parents with a migrant background to be more actively involved in their children education, and at the same time offering them the chance to improve their ICT skills, leading thus to better professional perspectives and providing access to equal educational opportunities.\r\nApplicants\u2019 research confirmed the role of digital media in that process (cf. www.carrer-guide.eu, www.aumil.de, www.tu9.de/mooc) both as learning technology and as gate opener for less connected audiences-like the chosen group migrant pupils. Indeed social (educational) media seem to be a very powerful instrument in the hand of this respective group, including their parents, when they need to identify their entrance into different EU cultures. Digital empowerment holds a central role in the inclusion strategy of adult population at risk of exclusion and reflects the latest EU Council conclusions on the social dimension of education and training; Social inclusion is a basic principle of human rights and is closely linked to concepts of social justice. ICT plays an important role in promoting social justice in terms of educational quality . \r\nThe proposed project will reinforce teachers\u2019 awareness, motivation, knowledge and skills that will enable them to strengthen parents\u2019 roles in schooling. Using social media properly is one of the best parent engagement strategies. It allows teachers to securely keep parents updated on their child\u2019s progress, school announcements, events etc. Plus it is incredibly easy to use and is built to be incredibly user friendly. Therefore, it is easy to implement within the school. \r\nTo this end a training framework will be designed, tailored to their learning profile and needs, equipping them with all the attitudes, values, knowledge, skills and life-long learning competences to enable them support and sustain parental engagement in school communities. The envisioned framework will provide comprehensive guidance to teachers how to promote and encourage effective cooperation between parents and teachers; as such, training seminars will take place across the partnership (both F2F & online) addressing parents, teachers, stakeholders, policy makers, whereas a two phases implementation is envisioned (with all the necessary revises/ amendments, etc.) till the final version of training framework is delivered. \r\nTeachers, in particular head teachers and class teachers, but also school personnel working in advisory and support systems, will constitute the main target group of Open School Doors; as key-agents, they will be trained to develop positive attitudes and particular skills in order to invite, motivate, support migrant parents and collaborate with them to deal effectively all obstacles of school life.\r\nThe indirect target group of the project is parents with a migrant background and in most cases with socially, educationally and economically disadvantaged background. Migrant pupils will be the long-term beneficiaries of the project approach, since schools' and parents' partnerships, that the project sets out to foster, have been found to have significant positive effects on important aspects of young people's development, e.g. achievement from early childhood until adolescence and adulthood, social and cognitive development, school drop-out reduction, social integration and fewer behavior problems. A supportive material for the migrant parents, enhancing effective communication with teachers, will be also delivered.\r\nFinally a Guide of Good Practices will bring together a range of relevant resources and evidence, synthesising background policy and research with original empirical research findings to produce specific guidance for policy makers and training curriculum developers. As such, it will illustrate how to increase parental engagement, effectively communicate with teachers through web2.0 tools, and map all potential members of Open School Doors community of interest at regional, national and EU level building thus upon the sustainability of the whole initiative.", "http://www.bcu.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA201-035602_4"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", 172172.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.bcu.ac.uk", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035784_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", 147323.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.bcu.ac.uk", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023405_coordinator"], [2016, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", 132371.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

The current situation is determined by following facts:\r\n\r\n- Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a serious problem among hospital and home care personnel, and in particular the nursing and care staff. The primary cause for MSDs is patient handling tasks such as lifting, transferring, and repositioning of patients. Regarding the UK evidence, this is an increasing trend and 54% of all accidents in the health care sector are associated with manual handling. The situation in the rest of the Europe is even worse.\r\n- Even if there are a lot of programmes for VET in the medical sector, their impact is rather low. There is a gap in the educational and training approaches, which would bring a shift in the training and change the moving and handling stereotypes brought by the old training methodologies. \r\n- The current situation in the health sector shows a high dynamics in regard to the new trends and technologies.\r\n- There is also a need to react at the changes in nursing education in EU in general. Cross-sectorial work is required and the rapid development of new technologies and its tremendous impact on the health sector should be recognised. Vocational education and training in the field of M&H is of enormous importance for daily work life of nurses. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to transfer an innovative M&H educational programme developed in the UK by the Birmingham City University into 4 European countries (Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia and Lithuania). \r\n\r\nThe main project activities are:\r\n- Analysis of the state of the art\r\n- Transfer and adjustment of the innovate M&H educational programme to 4 countries\r\n- Train the trainers activities\r\n- Pilot testing of the 4 adjusted programme versions\r\n- Impact evaluation\r\n- Final adjustment of the 4 versions of the m&h course\r\n- Multiplier events and dissemination\r\n- Project and risk management\r\n\r\nThe impact of the project can be seen in several areas:\r\na) Improvement of the educational process and increasing the efficiency of education\r\nb) Reduction of nurse injuries especially work-related musculoskeletal disorders\r\nc) Improvement of health care processes\r\n\r\nProject is submitted by the company LINET, number 4 producer of high tech hospital beds worldwide, which is also active in the field of innovative training.

There are apprentices within the subject fields of process, silversmiths and blacksmiths. As a target group for knowledge sharing, there will be teachers from the departments of blacksmiths, process and electrician and a project coordinator.\r\nThe purpose of the students\u2019 mobility stays includes strengthening and upgrading their professional identity and developing their knowledge of their professions. The goldsmith basic course students are to rediscover the discipline filigree. The silversmith apprentices are to achieve a much larger and more independent approach to design and rediscover different silversmith techniques, the aim is also to counter and prevent loss of competences in the subject field. For blacksmith apprentices the intention is to get a peek into travelling with the subject field and experience their profession in other contexts. Process operator apprentices will experience their own specialist knowledge in a new, different and relevant production in this project mainly in the fishing industry. The electrician basic course students will get to work project-oriented and strengthen their professional identity, the mobility stays are based on student exchange and return visits. Basic course Students from the education of carpenters will through work placements strengthen their professional identity working with in another building tradition. The mobility stay is likely to boost interest in the possibility of seeking an apprenticeship abroad with PIU or see opportunities in traveling with work.

For the many content professionals new to the market, improving their networking and collaboration skills has become critical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs well as Europass, certification will be offered in employability, leadership and Build-your-Own Masters modules in professional media practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology: \r\n\r\nIn the UK, partners in the sending and receiving countries set a brief to which participants respond with a project proposal that addresses technical, business and creative requirements, as well as their own learning needs. Arriving abroad before the main event starts, they share skills and work with local creative professionals to develop and pitch their plans, attending leading-edge workshops (such as on archive use, audience engagement, co-production and pitching) and observing and participating in live pitches and feedback sessions. Throughout the event, they work with event organisers to engage international audiences using social media to disseminate English-language reports and measure their impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults/Impact: \r\n\r\n- On individuals: experience shows us that mixing recent graduates and staff outside a classroom encourages sharing of skills and knowledge. Younger participants often have greater confidence with technology while elder ones bring greater confidence, networking and business skills. \r\n\r\n- On partners: sharing industry excellence and VET skills and developing the European dimension of partners, many of whom are poorly engaged outside their own regions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits:\r\n\r\n- Our partners are committed to exploring and developing ideas and this project is expected to result in cross-referrals to events, strategic funding applications, international co-productions and other transnational joint ventures. \r\n\r\n- As well as up-to-date world-class knowledge and skills, individual participants benefit from greater confidence and the transferrable skills developed through this programme.\r\n\r\n- Our company benefits through developing greater capacity to deliver leading-edge vocational education and training to its client learners.", "http://www.bcu.ac.uk", "Contented Ltd", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000551_10"], [2015, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", 44610.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

The conservatory has 549 students, of ages that go mainly from 8 to 18, and 54 teachers. The city of Lugo is a geographically peripheral city (both in Europe and in the Iberian Peninsula) and considering that until recently most teachers of the conservatory were itinerant, it was difficult to maintain long-term educational projects.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the conservatory's staff has become steady and this has allowed inquisitiveness and initiatives on behalf of the teachers to rise so that the educational aims of the conservatory are now modern, innovative and with a European dimension.\r\n\r\nWith this project, the staff at the CMUS Xo\u00e1n Montes has decided to carry out a KA1 project to help improve the teachers' competences and observe the different European educational centres of similar or higher characteristics to ours (the management made of their educational and human resources, the management of space, collaboration with other organizations, etc.). We would also like to establish contacts for future collaborations and directly involve the rest of the educational community.\r\nAs for the staff involved in the project, a team of 17 teachers of different instrumental specialities and coordinated by two teachers (bassoon and clarinet) work together in the development and organization of this international project.\r\n\r\nThe conservatory wants to promote an education based on quality, encourage the use of foreign languages and provide education with the international dimension needed in order to make our students genuine citizens of Europe.\r\nWe seek to have clear signs of identity, amongst which we want to highlight our concern in educational innovation, information technology (IT), basic competences and the use of foreign languages, as well as the importance of diversity. We want to improve our methodological competences and promote the creativity, innovation and modernization of our educational project.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the contact with professionals from other European schools with different sensitivities and experiences will reinforce the conservatory's European dimension opening it up to new ways of understanding education and teaching.\r\nThe teachers' mobility will enable us to improve and enhance their training, both in the linguistic field (updating and refreshing foreign languages) as well as methodologically, broadening their abilities and promoting the creation of new educational resources.\r\n\r\nIn the medium term, one of the aims of our conservatory is to improve and increase our educational offer in order to enhance and delve into the European dimension of the centre and offer our students a glance of the European diversity and the common values of a musical education. For this, the professional development of the staff is essential, as this will help us to establish contact with teachers from other countries with the hope of creating new projects of collaboration and cooperation with different centres and also be able to count with an ample and diverse network of collaborating centres, both from a geographical and cultural, linguistic point of view.\r\n\r\nThe training received by the teachers who will participate in the activities, which will help improve their linguistic, social, professional, digital and educational competences, will also be shared with the rest of the conservatory's staff\r\nand with the collaborating centres.\r\n\r\nThe project designed to achieve all these improvements is planned for a total of two years, and the conservatory's plans as for the mobility activities of the teachers can be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n - 8 Job-Shadowing in different European countries (Portugal, Hungary, Poland, Norway, Italy, the United Kingdom, Sweden and France).\r\n - 1 clarinet mechanics course in France.\r\n - 2 language courses in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAfter carrying out the corresponding analysis of our conservatory's needs, we believe that the European dimension that this project will provide us will help us define clear, innovative signs of identity for our conservatory to become an educational centre of music of

The contribution of every player in the financial ecosystem - including European, local, and financial institutions, as well as accountants - to help reach that aim is crucial.( \u201cFinancial education for entrepreneurs: how to get it right?\" - 7 October 2014, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and Barclays).On the other way the innovativeness of the project is to provide micro enterprises young entrepreneurs with an agile toolkit, capable to support their investment choices, through the development of basic but fundamental competences in this field. Financial literacy can entail difficult concepts which can hinder the capability to make investments and manage the financial asset of an entrepreneur. This is true especially if the size of the business is not large and is more grounded on a small local economy, rather than having a wider economic scope. These goals will be achieved by the joint efforts of all organizations involved in the consortium, as well as third parties and stakeholders, through the development of specific tools addressing the specific needs microenterprises entrepreneurs:1.

Regular evaluation and improvement at the classroom/workshop level contribute to this goal. They are, however, highly dependent on teachers\u2019 and trainers\u2019 competences of providing tailored training, reflecting on the learning process, evaluating outcomes and transfer and improving their provision accordingly. \r\nThese crucial competences are rarely taught in initial education and training of teachers and trainers. Neither are they included in quality management and personnel development at the institutional level as a comprehensive analysis of 130 LdV and Grundtvig QA projects conducted in the QALLL project (www.qalll.eu) has shown.\r\nQualiTools aims to meet this demand: The project seeks to enhance the quality of the actual learning process and its outcome by equipping teachers and trainers with the necessary transversal skills. It combines top-down strategies in QM and with bottom-up QA tools for teachers and trainers and shows how a pedagogical quality approach on the practitioners' level can be embedded in traditional quality management. It supports the non-formal, work-based learning of ICT teachers/trainers in a field still largely unknown to them: evaluation and quality assurance. It thus enhances the general capacity building of VET professionals and also contributes to the further development of EQAVET.\r\nAdded-value of the project: So far, quality methods for teachers/trainers have only been developed and used on a small scale and in a fragmented way. A coherent and comprehensive approach to improving teaching and learning through evaluation and quality assurance on the classroom level is missing. Additionally, the scope of existing tools is limited. The added-value of QualiTools is to gather existing tools, revise and adapt them to the target group, develop additional tools for areas not covered and provide a new comprehensive approach which will be practical and easy-to-implement. \r\nIn a nutshell, QualiTools aims at\r\n- enhancing the professional development of those working in ICT training\r\n- fostering sustainable bottom-up quality improvements at the level of ICT training institutions \r\n- ultimately enhancing learning outcomes and learning transfer in ICT training provision.\r\n\r\nTarget groups: The project focuses on initial and continuous training in ICT since this branch is at the vanguard of developments and an early adopter of innovative approaches. Within ICT training, all key actors are addressed: The primary target group are ICT trainers/teachers in technical schools and VET institutions providing non-formal or formal further training in ICT as well as tutors in ICT enterprises. Enhancing their pedagogical competences in evaluation and quality improvement is at the core of the project\r\nThe secondary target group are managers in ICT training institutions/companies who will receive guidelines and a training programme on how to implement the quality tools.\r\nICT students are the ultimate beneficiary. They will benefit from a higher teaching and training quality. \r\nMain products and activities: \r\nThe main products are the Qualitools handbook and database containing 50 quality tools for ICT trainers/teachers. They will focus using needs assessment, reflection, feedback, evaluation and monitoring to improve the quality of the learning process, learning outcomes and transfer of learning. The tools will include 20 existing good practice QA tools of 3 EU projects (selected in the QALLL study), which will be revised and adapted, and 30 new tools. The latter will be researched or (further) developed based on an analysis of the QA situation in ICT training. The comprehensive database will provide a simple, quick & EU-wide online access for the target groups to the QualiTools through the project website www.qualitools.net.\r\nTo ensure an adequate use of the tools by ICT teachers/trainers, a capacity building f2f & a webinar training programme will be developed, valorised & evaluated.

This offers a solution to EU wide unemployment by enabling young people to create their own employment and become successful entrepreneurs that look beyond country borders. It also addresses the need for VET students to exploit the opportunities the EU market offers.

Although partners have various background and expertise, there is a common vision, goal, and experience and that is the integration of young individuals in the entrepreneurship sphere.\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of the Europe 2020 Strategy, this programme contributes to entrepreneurial education and training to tackle youth unemployment. What we see a lot, is that young people have finished their study and are still not able to find a job easily.

It attaches importance to the affective aspect of learning, building self-motivation to learn, which is particularly important for disadvantaged people.\r\nThe innovativeness of the project involves several areas:\r\n\u2022 knowledge: promoting in adult education a teaching methods based on the latest research, which is continued, concerning brain development, previously used primarily in the context of work with children and youth \r\n\u2022 transferring the scientific concept of neuroadragogy into a practical use in adult education\r\n\u2022 introducing a new target group which may benefit from the achievements of neurodidactics \u2013 adults from disadvantaged backgrounds, threatened with social exclusion\r\n\u2022 promoting a new competencies for teachers and adult educators: the ability to design a teaching process using the assumptions of neuroandragogy; ability to build motivation to learn in case of adults; ability to individualize the learning process by taking into account the cognitive preferences of adult learners and their personal and professional experiences;  ability to develop learning materials for adult learners in accordance with neudoandragogy\r\n\u2022 internationalization of the subject of neuroandragogy as an effective method of teaching adults from disadvantaged groups - cooperation of European educational institutions in this field, exchange of experiences, etc.\r\nMain beneficiaries of the project will be adult people from disadvantaged groups, threatened or affected by social exclusion. The second main target group for the project is teachers, educators, trainers working with adult learners or cooperating with anti-exclusion institutions and organizations.\r\nThere will be the following project outputs: \r\n\u2022 A teachers\u2019 training program \u201cNeuroandragogy in adult education at risk of exclusion\", including educational materials.\r\n\u2022 Training materials for disadvantaged adults, developing their skills of effective learning, using the rules of neuroandragogy.\r\n\u2022 An interactive educational platform \"Neuroandragogy against exclusion\"\r\n\u2022 Publication: \u201eNeuroandragogy against exclusion\"\r\nAll project outputs will be tested by the main target groups \u2013teachers and disadvantaged adults\u2013 during pilot trainings. \r\nThe project results will help teachers realise the great potential offered by neuroandragogy in adult education. They will develop their knowledge concerning the assumptions of teaching based on knowledge of brain functioning. They will obtain information related to use of neuroandragogy in personalisation of work with an adult student. Participation in the project will also allow teachers to acquire lesson planning skills in order to support the adult students\u2019 motivation to work and development and include their individual capacities related to the learning methods.\r\nDue to the project disadvantaged adults will develop one of their basic competences \u2013 the ability to learn.

Human beings are sociable creatures and we have developed many ways to communicate our messages, thoughts and feelings with others. What is said is influenced by both verbal language and the way we use it - tone of voice, volume of speech and the words we choose - as well as by more subtle messages such as body language, gestures and other non-verbal communication methods. The fact that some people are better 'social interactors' than others has led to detailed investigations into the nature and function of interpersonal interaction. Developing social skills is about being aware of how we communicate with others, the messages we send and how methods of communication can be improved to make the way we communicate more efficient and effective. Training on social skills of high-skill workers are done throughout their educational life and business life both formally and informally. However the situation is different for low skilled blue/pink collar workers since they do not have opportunity to have this training at their working life or during their education. This project aims at promoting the social skills of adults through the web portal on which users can be personalize their training according to their needs and professions by having an entrance test. The content will be prepared in user friendly and attractive manner to motivate the learners. At the first output of the project need analysis will be done to decide the skills and occupation and to match skills with occupations. During the preparation of need analysis report, focus group meetings, literature review and questionnaires will be used. According to the need analysis, the training content for social skills will be prepared by taking into consideration of the Knowles\u2019 andragogy. The training content for social skills will be prepared at EQF 3 and 4 levels. Final output of the project is preparing training content, guideline and methodology for trainers at adult training centers to enhance their training skills and encourage them to open social skills courses.

Research at national level shows that cyberbullying tends to be perceived as an alarming and growing phenomenon (Report from European Parliament: Cyberbullying among young people, 2016).\r\n\r\nThe ACBC.COM project will tackle this issue and prevent young people from potential social exclusion. The project will introduce young people to the phenomenon of cyberbullying and raise awareness about the related impact and consequences. The project does this by developing a Serious Game that youth workers and teachers can use in youth initiatives, education and training to encourage young people to understand cyberbullying, recognise its impact and think about the effects and consequences of their own and others online presence, resulting in the development of (social) media literacy and critical thinking skills, which are essential in the digital age.\r\n\r\nACBC.COM also clearly addresses the sectoral priority \u2018Support youth workers in developing and sharing effective methods in reaching out to marginalised young people, in preventing racism and intolerance among youth, and in addressing the risks, opportunities, and implications of digitalisation.\u2019 Cyberbullying is a media literacy issue that is rapidly evolving and needs action in the area. This project enables youth workers to address online awareness with young people in a modern, engaging and involving manner, through Serious Gaming.\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\nFor young people today, going online to connect and interact with others is a natural and integral part of daily life. As they log on to email, blog, chat, or participate in online social networks, young people no longer see the Internet as simply a tool, but rather as an extension of their social lives and public identities. With new technologies being available and increased access to ICTs by young people, new risks emerge. One of these risks is cyberbullying taking new forms such as mockery, insults, threats, rumours, gossip, disagreeable comments, slander, etc. which threaten the health, well-being and attainment of victims. Cyberbullying is regarded as a serious threat with a potentially long-lasting impact in Europe.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE \u2013 ONLINE CONSCIOUSNESS\r\nThe objective is to actively involve youth in a modern way to truly engage them on the topic of online behaviour in order to prevent cyberbullying. This will be done by offering youth organisations, schools and other youth initiatives and programmes the knowledge, tools and network to set up a network and programme on Online Media Awareness.\r\n\r\nTARGET GROUPS\r\n- YOUTH (13-18 YEARS) - The main target group of ACBC.COM is young people with an age between 13-18 years. European wide the 13-18 age category stands out as the most exposed to cyberbullying. This target group can be reached through schools (students), but also via youth organisations, sports clubs, youth programmes and initiatives, etc.\r\n- YOUTH ORGANISATIONS & SCHOOLS \u2013 It is through them the project outputs will be delivered to the final beneficiaries. With support of the ACBC.COM User Guide, youth workers, social workers, teachers and other people that work with youth on a daily basis will get an in depth understanding of cyberbullying and will be able to implement the ACBC.COM Serious Game with the target group, young people.\r\n- COMMUNITY \u2013 The set up and development of Regional Partnerships involves a broader community to enhance the discussion on online behaviour and to raise awareness on cyberbullying. These Partnerships will involve organisations from a broader view to ensure an integrated approach and wide impact.\r\n\r\nOUTPUTS\r\nThe concrete OUTPUTS VIP@Work will develop are:\r\nIO1 \u2013 Regional Partnerships - Blueprint\r\nIO2 \u2013 User Guide\r\nIO3 \u2013 Serious Game\r\nIO4 \u2013 Online Community and Open Education Resources\r\nIO5 \u2013 Impact measurement - Methodology & Guidelines\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nACBC.COM adopts an integrated approach to ensure achievement of the project results.

Populist voices are becoming mainstream, suggesting negative connotations of \"political correctness\" and questioning a general consensus about respective democratic principles. Correspondingly, recent reports and studies, as well as daily media reports, show that verbal and physical violence, different forms of aggression - often against weak members of society - are increasing, more and more leading to escalating incidents and conflicts in everyday life, as well as on the internet (cyber violence, hate comments, mobbing etc.). For example, the UK Social Capital Report (Office of National Statistics) shows alarming indicators of fewer and fewer people stating they could rely on others (16%), while active participation, engagement with neighbours/communities is strikingly decreasing (32% of adults). The most alarming trend has been the drastic increase in hate crime, which, in 2017, increased by 29%.\r\nIt is obvious that, in such respects, traditional pedagogy has not sufficiently reached learners and does not provide concrete answers and solutions, which is particularly true for supporting low-skilled young adults, who lack chances in occupation and self-determined/reflected life management in general, and often regard themselves as belonging to a marginalised group of society. The empowerment of young people, especially in terms of strengthening their readiness and ability to actively participate in communities of society, goes in line with the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty and represents an important task within the European Union. \r\nFor adult education in Europe, these challenges have brought a need for more holistic and multidisciplinary approaches, especially in terms of basic skills provision, which is where our project \"Discover and Use Your Skills and Civil Courage - a new way of empowerment for young disadvantaged adults in Europe\" comes in: the project partnership, first and foremost, addresses teachers, trainers, coaches, social workers, counsellors working with young adult learners (16-25) and wants to provide concrete approaches and results for their professional use. The project is based on the need to extend the conceptual and practical understanding of \"basic skills\" by civil courage awareness, skills and competences young people will require for active democratic participation as responsible and well-rounded citizens in times of societal changes. Respective professionalisation of adult educators (active at schools, training centers, career service organisations etc) will build on new (non-school) learning concepts, environments and activities, in order to enable educators to better reach their learners.    \r\nIn order to strenghten active democratic participation amoung young adults in Europe and combat current negative trends, the \"Courage\" operative partnership - consisting of educational providers, social and pedagogic experts from the UK, Austria, Romania, Norway and Germany - in cooperation with their selected associated partners- will bring together their multidisciplinary expertise to:\r\n- develop output solutions (new pedagogic concepts, practical tools, adult education models) for practicioners working with the final beneficiaries/end users of this project through three innovative pedagogic outputs (Me and my Courage self study manual for trainers, Me and My Courage Case Box and Civic Courage Showcases) and\r\n- provide policy recommendations, strategic multiplication and sustainable implementation structures for relevant stakeholders on a European Level\r\nParticipant involvement capacities of the partnership will be utilized to directly reach 100 staff members/trainers, 50 representatives of the final target group/learners and 300 other key stakeholders on national and European le\u03bdel during output development and validation, as well as through participation at national Multiplier Events.", "http://www.bridgingtothefuture.co.uk", "BRIDGING TO THE FUTURE LTD", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA204-048016_coordinator"], [2018, "Student-driven Leadership Skills Development Programme in VET Schools", "BRIDGING TO THE FUTURE LTD", 160442.0, 5, 6, "SLEVET project corresponds to further strengthening key competences in VET and achievement of relevant and high quality skills and competences.

It would be much more productive if they are prepared for facilitators of the processes, and for the realization of those functions to be used the internal resources of the students themselves, i.e. students to learn students approach. In support of this hypothesis is the fact that people learn best and perceive patterns from \"one of their own\".\r\n\r\nSLEVET initiative is aimed to elaborate LEADERSHIP PROGRAMME for developing leadership and entrepreneurship skills, attitudes and mindset of students in VET schools. The innovation elements of this programme: Peer to Peer coaching and Peer to Peer training are applied; teachers are Facilitators; it involves real entrepreneurs; students gain experience as Leaders in real situations.\r\nOur specific objectives are: \r\n- to create, apply, test and disseminate Student-driven Leadership Skills Development Programme in VET Schools;\r\n- to promote the SLEVET approach across professional teachers\u2019 communities in our countries and Europe;\r\n- to develop and launch sustainability plan for SLEVET Training KIT exploitation beyond project lifetime and across Europe by October 2020.\r\n\r\nThe main target groups of our proposal are teachers and students in VET Schools. Through the implementation of our project we would place our target groups in new roles. Teachers will become facilitators, and students from 10-11 grades will take an active role of coaches and mentors to their younger schoolmates from 8-9 grades. The number of direct participants will be 12 teachers and  116 students.\r\n\r\nThe consortium is a combination of representatives of different sectors (public, private and NGO) from 5 countries, which is a positive precondition for: \r\n- exchange and analysis of best practices on the topic;\r\n- scope and impact of activities;\r\n- dissemination of results and their multiplication in various networks and partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe approach for meeting the aim and objectives for this project is identified within the following key activities: development, training, piloting, dissemination, management and evaluation. These components are more than a list of typical activities. They are logically substantiated, intertwined and mutually influenced. Good implementation of each is a prerequisite for the fulfillment of others.\r\n\r\nThe consortium expects the following project results:\r\n- Prepared students from higher grades who are on the threshold of the labor market for leaders, entrepreneurs, mentors.\r\n- Improved learning results of younger students; developed social skills and potential to be leaders, entrepreneurs, mentors.\r\n- Prepared teachers for facilitators of extracurricular activities, to be more adequate for the above listed processes.\r\n- Developed guides, programmes and instruments for the implementation of the above and ensuring sustainability by applying the approach after the project`s end.\r\n- Promoting social entrepreneurship as a tool for the modernization of VET. \r\nOne of the major advantages of the approach is the option to be reproduced by using internal resources of students themselves and even to be profitable with a view to financial autonomy through the form of a social enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe CASCADING MENTORING SYSTEM ensures the project\u2019s sustainability beyond the initial pilot group i.e. there is inbuilt sustainability as an integral part of the Leadership  programme.

This will see SLAM to be delivered on a wider scale, by organisations working with marginalised youth groups (rural, severely disabled, the disaffected - those underrepresented in enterprise and leadership positions e.g. LGBT, Women, Minorities) and in a flexible and scalable way. \r\nThe SLAM Model is an enabling & empowering leadership development methodology with an entrepreneurial edge. SLAM consists of practical coaching sessions, bespoke learning resources & development pathways, peer-led learning&teaching and live experience in real life scenarios. These are enhanced through continuous advice&support from local enterprise and community leaders. The focus is on 1)Organisations (youth workers, teachers, trainers) to coach young people in leadership & enterprise through integrating the \u2018learning of leadership\u2019 methodology with practical involvement in enterprise activities 2) Learners (young people) to develop their enterprise & leadership QEAS (qualities, experiences, attitudes and skills) to a level where they can a)cascade their learning to peers & b)further develop themselves through this cascading. The result is the increased capacity&confidence, of youth & youth organisations to be leaders and more enterprising in their own lives and communities.

More specifically : 1. Entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial  attitude and  behaviour:Our students of level 4+EQF are more and more aware of the fact that they need to make their own choices in life in order to be economically and financially independent in an early stage of their life. The situation in Europe requires a more personified and individualized career path to reach personal goals. Our objective is to empower students in realizing a fulfilling, satisfying, fruitful life and career, either in Europe or in our region . Communication skills, using English in a natural setting, meeting young people in other countries, being part of their peer-to-peer training in social entrepreneurship is a good source for empowerment.  Developing personal leadership in a programme of excellence enables them to follow a path of growth, on a multisectoral level.Teachers and students wil be trained abroad within the companies involved.

The project will provide a method based on a specific didactic material about entrepreneurs and economic activities creation with social inclusion, based on our own platform, User Guide and How to Guide with different contents that can be adapted to other countries and differents didactics programs.\r\n\r\nIn the didactic units it will be available designed concepts related to the sector of the Social Economy, in the European economy, but also content on how to identify problems, develop ideas, develop entrepreneurial projects, development of skills such as communication, marketing, financing, among others. \r\n\r\nTaking this project as a model of management in the sector of the Social Economy for long term unemployed, it will be transmitted to the users the importance of the human capital over the capital as base for the creation of a stable and competitive company, the determinant paper of the collaborative structures of work, and the importance of the confluence of the aims and managerial results with the needs and potentials of the social environment in which the companies develop his activity.\r\n\r\nThis 24 month project - ETC.4SE - is a partnership of 5 organizations led by Drosostalida, a Greek social enterprise.

In addition, half of the unemployed people are currently long-term unemployed, that is, unemployed for more than 12 months. As a result of this situation, poverty and social exclusion are affecting an increasing number of young people. However\u00a0social enterprise, can reverse this tendency. \r\nSocial enterprise creates sustainable growth by considering environmental impact and people and social cohesion. The social economy and social enterprises have managed to overcome economic and financial crisis, demonstrating the ability to overcome through social innovation. Indeed, a report on Social enterprise and social economy, endorsed during the 11th GECES (2016), shows that: in 2010, the social economy provided work to 14.5 million Europeans and, according to the latest estimates, it currently accounts for 10% of jobs in the EU and 8% of EU GDP. \r\nNevertheless, young social entrepreneurs lack specialised training, visibility, support networks and often need motivational, technical and financial support.\r\nThe project is needed, not only to give them the necessary skills and tools to carry out their ideas, but also to prepare them for a rapidly changing world, in which traditional jobs tend to disappear or to evolve. Learners should be given the opportunity to develop general skills such as problems solving, decisions making and risks assessing, which employers value. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOur project will target people among 15-29 years old, both those who want to learn how to strengthen soft skills which are particularly sought-after by employers, and young would-be entrepreneurs who will be supported through a methodology already tested with success in more than 5 European countries.\r\nThe Social SME Academy project aims to promote social entrepreneurship among young people by fostering their creativity and giving them support in starting up their entrepreneurial ideas through a Business Incubator Coaching Programme.\r\nThe 24 months project is composed of 4 main parts.\r\n1. Initially, partners will develop an Online Handbook on Societal Challenges faced by partners\u2019 countries, which analyses current trends in Social Entrepreneurship, its diffusion in Europe (with particular focus on partners\u2019 countries) and define the research basis for the development of the Social Entrepreneurship Manual (O2).The Handbook will be uploaded to the online platform as OER.\r\n2. In the 2nd phase, on the base of O1, The Social Entrepreneurship Manual will be developed, to indicate steps that young people have to follow in order to become social entrepreneurs.\r\nThe manual will including also a solid needs assessment which analyses the views of young people and youth workers at a European and national level, starting from the existing know-how based on the previous experience of the partners which developed another similar project together, desk researches & practical experience of the partners. \r\n3. In the 3rd phase, 50 young aspiring entrepreneurs will participate to the BUSINESS INCUBATOR COACHING PROGRAMME that will be organised in the partners\u2019 countries. Young people from all over Europe will be assisted during their startup phase, through direct and online mentoring and tutoring, in order to shape their business ideas in the social field and develop their hard and soft skills.\r\n4. In the 4th phase, Partners will develop a number of 10 video tutorials (2 X each partner) based on the training materials used for the pilots and the Manual of Best Practices (O2). These videos will be uploaded to Social SME Academy website and on the YouTube channel and then they will be disseminated thanks to a strong online campaign. The videos will be used to strengthen the relationship with our target group of young people and attract more potential users by approaching them in a direct and practical way. \r\nThe project Social SME Academy is based on an innovative methodology for startups and early-stage enterprises, providing support and access to the world of social entrepreneurship, thanks to integration of benefits offered by the Business Incubator Coaching Programme, containing useful training and inspiring resources, and those of BTFJCM (Bridging to the Future Job Creation Model) methodology.\r\nThe project offers strong impact towards youth willing to undertake entrepreneurial experience in social field by empowering their skills and competences and supporting them in creation of new businesses.\r\nINTELLECTUAL OUTPUTS\r\n\u2022 IO1 - Online handbook on Societal Challenges in each partner Country\r\n\u2022 O2 - Youth Social Entrepreneurship Manual & Self-assessment test for would-be Entrepreneurs\r\n\u2022 O3 - Startup Accelerator & Business Incubator Coaching Programme\r\n\u2022 O4 - SSME Academy Video Tutorials\r\nMULTIPLIER EVENTS\r\n\u2022 National Dissemination Workshops in each participating country", "http://www.bridgingtothefuture.co.uk", "BRIDGING TO THE FUTURE LTD", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA205-037097_coordinator"], [2017, "Impacto de los programas de emprendimiento en la adquisici\u00f3n de competencias en los j\u00f3venes", "BRIDGING TO THE FUTURE LTD", 115804.0, 4, 5, "CONTEXT:\r\nThe Council recommendation of 20/12/12, according the validation of the non formal learning (2012/C398/01), has invited all members of European Union to approve validation' dispositions for the validation of non formal learning before 2018. Subsequently, within the recommendation according the entrepreneurship' promotion among young people in order to facilitate their social inclusion (2014/C183/04), has emphasized the role of non formal education with a view of a holistic approach towards the  personal development of young people and their integration within the labour market. \r\n\r\nWithin that frame, the recognition of young people' competences and skills turns into a real need,  so as to demonstrate their employability competences and with that to contribute to their social integration. In Spain, on 28th of March will be held first meeting at the National Youth Institute INJUVE in Madrid, with the aim to see the way to recognize professional comptences aqcuired through non formal learning within the youth sector. The project IMPACT pursues to answer this need by developing a measurement methodology of entrepreneurship competences acquired by young people during educative programs.\r\n\r\nThis methodology will be designed from out the experience of each partner in designing educative methodology for entrepreneurship promotion from different point of view, and with participation of a broad scale of actors involved: youth, investigators, youth workers, youth organisations, secondary schools, universities, companies and public organisations. \r\nWe will measure a series of skills and competences in order to monitor the development of so called soft skills in young people, competences that are characteristic for entrepreneur's spirit: the self-esteem, autonomy, critical mind set, efficiency, identity, knowledge of the community, active participation, responsibility, teamwork, resilience, creativity... competences that normally assemble the so called social and transversal skills.\r\n\r\nOBJETIVES:\r\nIMPACT wants to give answer to the need of creating innovative views related to the competences validation by designing as main aim a measurement methodology for acquisition of competences related to the entrepreneurship of young people. The methodology will be tested on young people that will have participated in one didactic methodology designed by project partners.\r\nSpecific aims:\r\n\u2022 To design a measurement system for competences related to entrepreneurship; \r\n\u2022 To create a proposal for recognition of entrepreneurship competences; \r\nThe execution of the project is based on the following goals:\r\n\u2022 Cooperation and exchange of didactic experiences while promoting entrepreneurship among young people within different educative environments (formal and non formal);\r\n\u2022 Active participation of young people;\r\n\u2022 Empowerment of young people and improvement of their labour future;\r\n\u2022 Development and evolution of transversal competences (soft skills) and abilities among young people involved in the project;\r\n\u2022 To contribute to social inclusion of involved young people with less opportunities;\r\n\u2022 To provide information to political responsible of designing more adapted actions in order to enhance young people active participation and empowerment.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS:\r\nThere are two target groups in this project:\r\n\u2022 During the execution of the IMPACT: 2.000 young people and 50 professionals will participate in the test of the designed methodology through the implementation of didactic methodologies of our project partners. \r\n\u2022 The principal target group are the educators (teachers and youth workers) who will be able to use the tool once published, promoting improvement of their educative programs that aim on on promotion of entrepreneurship competences among young people.\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT. LONG TERM BENEFITS:\r\nOnce the project is finished we expect an impact that goes in the following four directions:\r\n\u2022 Scientific: to provide a set of variables and indicators for measurement of entrepreneurship competences. For its diffusion we will publish some articles and send them to scientific reviews;\r\n\u2022 Educative: providing a useful methodology for the educators to measure competences and skills related to entrepreneurship. This instrument will be presented to the accompaniment (advisory group) which is represented by several responsible of educative institutions;\r\n\u2022Quality: the measurement of the competences will allow any organisation to evaluate its own educative programs of entrepreneurship promotion and to design strategies for improvement based on the obtained results.

The objective of the Sustainable Student Mobility project (SUMO) is to centralize all student mobility under one project thus improving the quality of mobilities and making their management easier and more effective. During the project students in initial vocational education carry out a 4-10 week on-the-job training period or study period abroad. Part of the students give their vocational skills demonstrations abroad. In addition, students are encouraged to critical thinking by means of an assignment that deals with sustainable development. They are also motivated to make use of social media such as facebook, blogs, etc. during their on-the-job training period abroad. The beneficiaries of the project comprise 176 students in initial vocational education and 46 vocational teachers.\r\n\r\nStudents prepare themselves for the study / practical period abroad by means of self-study material collected in moodle and with the help of teachers. From the spring 2014, Savo Vocational College organizes annually in spring and autumn an international summer school offering students courses in English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French, German and Russian languages, 32 hours each. When selecting students for practical periods abroad, attention is paid to those who have done summer school courses, because in this way students prove their commitment and ability to plan their studies longer ahead. Students, of course, make also the language test designed by the European Commission. After having returned home the students will have feedback and assessment discussions with their teachers. \r\n\r\nThe vocational teacher agrees with the receiving organization on the contents, implementation and assessment of the practical period. Student, teacher and workplace instructor draw up an on-the-job training plan and, if necessary, a vocational skills demonstration plan. The vocational teacher prepares the student for the practical period abroad and for vocational skills demonstration. The on-the-job training periods are carried out according to the ECVET principles and guidelines in the ECVET Toolkit.  \r\n\r\nStudents are provided with before and after questionnaires, the purpose of which is to map the development of their language skills and professional skills. Additionally, students do an assignment about sustainable development and fill in a report in the Mobility Tool.  \r\n\r\nInternational coordinators and vocational teachers inform students about the project and take care of the selection and preparation of students, assessment of on-the-job training and vocational skills demonstration environments, training of workplace instructors, etc. Coordinator takes care of the documentation and financial administration and informs the key-players on the practices to be applied. \r\n\r\nIntroduction of new practices (for example ECVET) requires often training of workplaces. Most of the staff training periods in this project deal with training of workplace instructors into ECVET. One teacher gives a course in Trento, Italy. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe project will have remarkable results and impacts. Students learn new professional skills, communication skills, critical thinking and new things about the culture of the target country. They become more independent, gain self-confidence and courage. Their knowledge of languages improve and they are no longer afraid of using foreign languages. A practical period abroad may contribute to students\u2019 finding a workplace. International co-operation supports also lifelong learning of teachers participating in the project, leads to new international contacts and increases collegial collaboration. The project increases teachers\u2019 international skills, increases their enthusiasm towards the development of their own field of expertise and has a positive impact on their professional growth. In addition, the project improves the co-operation of vocational schools and companies in Europe and meets the demand of enterprises of Northern Savo, Finland for technical staff able to work in an international atmosphere (for instance in installation, service and maintenance tasks). The project supports the integration of mobility in the qualifications and increases the attractiveness of vocational education. With the student and staff mobilities, good practices related to the provision of education, student assessment and recognition and validation of learning outcomes become more known in organizations, which improves remarkably the quality of the practical periods abroad and the transparency of the exams.

Departments gather teachers of similar subjects, from whom proposals of students and teachers' mobilities, may arise in the future. From such departments will naturally arise interesting strategic partnerships for academic innovation. To achieve this goal 11 meetings have been scheduled in 11 different countries. Xabec organizes the meeting in \"Human Factors\" and attends 9 more meetings. Xabec teachers who will use mobilities for this call are the Heads of Department and, in some cases, will travel with a collaborator.\r\n\r\n2. STUDENTS.\r\nA group of 3 students carry out three months internships in Portugal and the UK. The companies share our mobility strategy.\r\n\r\n3. STUDENTS.\r\nAnd 6 students will travel to four schools for a \u201cProjectX\u201d previously agreed and validated by both institutions (sending and receiving) with assessment and validation of learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe most important result is the consolidation of InnMain European network. All of the partners are well-known: we have worked together in the past in TOI projects, or associations. And, of course, with some we already have positive experiences of mobilities.\r\n\r\nMobilities of both teachers and students will have their prior preparation: Technical Departments have a script supervised by the Executive Board of InnMain, and students will be prepared according to standard procedure established by Xabec's Internal Rules of procedure.\r\n\r\nXabec has a International Department that will be the one responsible for the administrative management of the entire project (see presentation: http://www.xabec.es/xabec-internacional.php).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected impact on Xabec environment will be very important: \r\n- firstly, teachers are going to be involved with the international department. This sets a new challenge on continuous improvement and extra motivation to improve language skills.\r\n- In the students, because the mobilities of ProjectX will not break the ordinary rhythm of classes and do not require  a high level of knowledge in foreign languages. This has already gotten the attraction of our students, increasing the number prospective students who wish to have an international experience.\r\n- In companies related with Xabec because they ask for students with social and international skills.\r\n- In the Valencian and Spanish society in general, because we honestly think that this experience can be put as an example of good practice.\r\n- And at European level, we hope to keep increasing the number of schools participating in this project, with this tool and methodology.\r\n\r\nAs a final summary we can say that CaLoReT 2015 reflects a desire to consolidate the international dimension we want for Xabec, in the context of InnMain European network: a reliable and stable network, with a strategy perfectly aligned with the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy.", "http://www.sccb.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA102-013718_4"], [2014, "Sharing and Reinforcing Relationships", "South & City College Birmingham", 22266.0, 7, 11, "Nowadays our school is living a moment of transformation as a result of the change of educational system: we are going from a regular system classroom-based to a dual training system work-based.

For this purpose we have chosen a group of schools in Europe that are well known in these areas by their quality and impact.

The objective of their mobility is improving Xabec international dimension,  the exchange of good practices in the processes of relationship and communication with companies and other relevant stakeholders.\r\n\r\nFor Xabec staff , the main impact of this project on an individual level of the participants will be the improvement of specific skills such as administrative skills, planning and management skills , strategic competences , international competences and teaching competences .\r\n\r\nFor students Xabec , the impact arises from the practical experience in a workplace in a foreign country which allows them to increase their maturity and autonomy , enhancing their motivation for the study , social cohesion, they will have a clear awareness of the European dimension. In addition there will be a quick development of their language skills and international competences. In the long term, these experiences are positive when they look for a job in Spain or in another EU country .\r\n\r\nAs an organization, the impact is at medium and long term by successfully incorporating to the internal processes the different issues  learned by participants.

Concerning those human resources, volunteers are largely underestimated and when they are appreciated, it is usual to suffer troubles as the current tools needed to coordinate them are different from the ones applied to normal paid staff on the third or private sector. According to this, non profit and volunteering organisations demand not only new accessible VET tools for their teams but also a professionalization of the field that could create the suitable environments for the personal and professional development of those working on it.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of covering this need and the recognition of the skills and competeces required on the volunteering management staff, \u201cLevol-app: learning app for the VET on volunteering management programmes\u201d appears as a solution to overcome the lack of new learning pathways orientated to cover the real profesional needs of non profit organisations and their teams.\r\nThe proposed project is a 28-month strategic partnership at European level that thanks to the funding of Erasmus+ and its Key Action 2 for the development of VET aims to gather organisations from different countries but working on the development of programmes to train volunteering organisations and managers.

To achieve this, partner organisations will create an online platform on five languages to support NGOs to improve their volunteer management in order to better engage volunteers as active citizens and improve the competences and professional skills of the volunteer managers.\r\nThe materials and training sessions to be created online will deal with topics such as planning a high impact volunteer program, organizing a volunteer program, creating motivation volunteer positions, recruiting the right volunteers, matching volunteers to work, preparing volunteers for success, supersizing volunteers for maximum performance, measuring volunteer program effectiveness, recognition of volunteers, transnational volunteering, etc. All the participants taking part on the project will not only be able to use this tool to create their own volunteering programmes, but will also have the support of personal coaches on each partner country that will help them to implement the knowledge acquired during the project.\r\nDuring the project implementation, partner organisations will run together different activities in the five countries involved such as:\r\n- Four coordination meetings on the project partner countries in order to get to know the best practices and local projects related to volunteering management and training.\r\n- Design, creation, test and publication of different materials and an online learning platform for non profit organisations.\r\n- Local meetings and focus groups on different parts of each partner country to meet the target group of the project and establish the needs to be covered by the project results.\r\n- A transnational training course for volunteer management coaches to capacitate them on the use of the project outputs, online platform and materials.\r\n- Online activities for learners (NGOs\u2019 staff and volunteers) interested on creating or improving the volunteer programmes of their organisations.\r\n- Multiplier events on each partner country to disseminate the project results and promote the use of its outputs.\r\n- The design of a quality seal that will reward the best volunteering programmes of those NGOs taking part in the project and using its online platform.\r\n\r\nAll the results of \u201cLevol-app\u201d will be openly shared by the project website that will not only inform about it, but also contain all its outputs and provide a permanent access to the online training platform created.", "http://www.bvsc.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PT01-KA202-035949_2"], [2017, "HEARTS+: Basketball Academy Enhancement", "Aston Athletics Basketball Club Community Interest Company", 117093.0, 2, 2, "CONTEXT\r\n\r\nBirmingham A's Basketball Club  is the largest community interest basketball club in the UK.
