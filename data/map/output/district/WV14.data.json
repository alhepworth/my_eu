The compatibility of the theme of this project with the curriculum of our technical school where professions like power engineering, renewable energy devices and systems and construction are taught and taking into consideration the suggestions of our local employers as well as adjusting to the requirements of our British and Portuguese partners results in the situation where educational value of the project seems to be enormous.Bearing in mind our graduates\u2019 expectations regarding future work prospects and noticing the need for educational innovations, the teachers in our school want to create the opportunities to obtain new abilities and to develop necessary vocational skills throughout the participation in this project. British and Portuguese energy industry, especially the sector related to green energy is the most powerful in Western Europe. Therefore, studying the regulations and gaining the experience in this area is an invaluable asset for our students\u2019 future career prospects.The most important objectives of the project are:-For our cooperating partner: steady growth of innovation in the area of vocational education,-For British and Portuguese institutions and companies: improvement of vocational training methods due to the possibility of comparing abilities of Polish students with their British and Portuguese peers.-For the participants: the chance to learn about  regulations and rules which must be followed in order to establish a business in the field of traditional and renewable energy industry, electronics industry and finally energy-efficient construction.  What is more, the participants are given the opportunity to gain the knowledge concerning British and Portuguese job market requirements, to develop professional competence and language fluency as well as to learn about modern technologies applied in the area of their interest.In order to make the project more effective all our plans were consulted with the local employers\u2019 representatives in the field of energy and construction industry such as ENGIE, ElpoBud and PolPrzem.

We want to change that. Participants internship with established experience will certainly be valued and sought after employees in their industries. In the opinion of our local employers ( employers conducted interviews with industry economic , mechanical and IT industry ) perfect employee should be characterized not only diligence , honesty and integrity , but also to high professional qualifications, experience acquired during the apprenticeship and become at least one foreign language , because a large portion of traders executes orders outside the country. Hence the idea of creating a project in cooperation with our regional entrepreneurs. Youth ending school education can be classified as disadvantaged groups in the labor market. This involves little professional experience of young workers entering the labor market and the lack of funds for training courses. Employers require in fact presentation experience in the industry. This implies a need to strengthen practical training at school and the use of EU funds for educational activities throughout their lives. In this situation, a very good way is to participate in the Leonardo da Vinci program. The student gains an additional prestige here, what is its positive value and increases the chance of getting a graduate job, because a greater degree meets the expectation of a potential employer.He or she also gets many other possibilities, such as - the European dimension of their education , training in the use of foreign language professional language, Europass Mobility Certificate. These benefits to some extent improve the situation of young worker in the labor market and increase their chances of finding employment.

The transport sector is a major contributor to these emissions, but the targets for this sector cannot be met with currently available materials technology. Due to the direct link between weight and energy consumption, EU investment in advancing lightweight technologies is crucial. Therefore, fibre-reinforced composites are a key technology, but they are not yet widely used due (1) to their high price, (2) overdesign due to a lack of toughness and (3) difficulties with recycling. Addressing these challenges through fibre-hybridisation requires a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with a strong background in both modelling and experimentation. Since such combined expertise is scarce, HyFiSyn aims to train 13 early stage researchers to become interdisciplinary, multi-talented experts. The 8 universities, 5 industrial partners and 2 professional training organisations offer the researchers a unique opportunity to be trained by world-leading experts in cutting-edge technologies, where they are supported by a strong network and industry participation. The training programme strongly emphasises entrepreneurship and innovation skills to maximise the impact of the project, thereby increasing the EU\u2019s innovation capacity. Simultaneously, the researchers will be trained through research by developing and experimentally validating advanced simulation tools to predict optimal microstructures for fibre-hybrid composites. These microstructures will then be manufactured and verified in industrial applications. To further increase its impact, HyFiSyn also designs hybrids with smart and functional properties, and will investigate strategies for more efficient usage of recycled fibres through fibre-hybridisation.
