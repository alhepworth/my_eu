The Linked Data paradigm has therefore evolved from a practical research idea into a very promising candidate for addressing one of the biggest challenges in the area of intelligent information management: the exploitation of the Web as a platform for data and information integration in addition to document search. To translate this initial success into a world-scale disruptive reality, encompassing the Web 2.0 world and enterprise data alike, the following research challenges need to be addressed: improve coherence and quality of data published on the Web, close the performance gap between relational and RDF data management, establish trust on the Linked Data Web and generally lower the entrance barrier for data publishers and users. With partners among those who initiated and strongly supported the Linked Open Data initiative, the LOD2 project aims at tackling these challenges by developing:1. enterprise-ready tools and methodologies for exposing and managing very large amounts of structured information on the Data Web,2. a testbed and bootstrap network of high-quality multi-domain, multi-lingual ontologies from sources such as Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap.3. machine learning algorithms for automatically enriching, repairing, interlinking and fusing data from the Web.4. standards and methods for reliably tracking provenance, ensuring privacy and data security as well as for assessing the quality of information.5. adaptive tools for searching, browsing, and authoring of Linked Data.We will integrate and syndicate linked data with large-scale, existing applications and showcase the benefits in the three application scenarios media &amp; publishing, corporate data intranets and e-government.", 731352.0, 8342462.0, 12, 17, "LOD2", null, "http://www.openlinksw.com", null, "fp7_95562_998372404"], [1354320000000, 1448841600000, "Making the Web an Exploratory for Geospatial Knowledge", "OpenLink Group Ltd", "The advent of the Data Web demonstrates how Web technologies can be employed to integrate dispersed, heterogeneous information. Most information \u2013 be it the product logistics status within supply chains, data warehouses of E-Commerce systems or offerings of the bakery shop next door \u2013 has a directly or indirectly associated spatial dimension. Integrating and efficiently using information with such a spatial dimension on the Web poses very particular challenges. First, we have to combine and reason about spatial and semantic features that use different vocabularies and representation techniques. Second, the wealth of pre-existing overlapping and complementary information sources in the spatial domain demands information management able to deal with billions of facts in a scalable manner. Third, only by dramatically lowering the entrance barriers extra value can be generated through the involvement of thousands of non-expert end users in authoring, curation and assessment. GeoKnow tackles these challenges and facilitates the transition from islands of isolated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to a Web of interlinked Geographic Knowledge Systems (GKS). GeoKnow focuses on two complementary application scenarios: (1) spatial-semantic collaboration and data integration along value-chains in supplier and customers networks; and (2) spatial-semantic travel E-Commerce data management.

Why is this important? In a world where nations and peoples are ever more dependent upon on another to supply goods and services, solve political disputes, and ensure international security, understanding other cultures is paramount. Lack of INTERCULTURAL SENSISTIVITY can lead to mistrust and misunderstandings, to an inability to cooperate, negotiate, and compromise, and perhaps even to military confrontation. INTERCULTURAL UNDERSTANDING begins with individuals who have LANGUAGE ABILITIES and who can thereby provide one's own nation or community with an insider's view into foreign cultures, who can understand foreign news sources, and give insights into other perspectives on international situations and current events. For survival in the global community, every nation needs such individuals. A person competent in other languages can bridge the gap between cultures, contribute to international diplomacy, promote national security and world peace, and successfully engage in international trade. Since the purpose of education is to prepare individuals for life and to instil a sense of DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP; and to do so for all learners, regardless of socio-economic and cultural differences, schools are the first education agencies that are called to work in this line. It's in response of this that thie project idea was born. The 9 partners, all agreed that a specific joint action for multilinguism should have be done because quality education and training fuel inclusive, sustainable growth as learning outcomes translate into the productivity and innovation of the working-age population.

The climate agenda clearly states that climate change threatens to undermine the ability of countries to achieve sustainable development. Similarly, water is a cross-cutting issue that affects all aspects of development, including health, food security, economic development, ecosystem services and biodiversity. The particular focus on water, climate and resilience during the Paris Climate Conference aims to encourage cooperation and initiatives in the area, both between countries and between different civil society actors.

Furthermore, students will also realize how important it is to work in a multinational project, as the very same rivers and water bases are often handled by other countries as well, as they pass through borders. However, water does not recognize borders or political treaties, and by approaching this vital element of life from various perspectives the school subjects covered in this application hopefully become a real, tangible experience which might help with a better understanding of sciences that otherwise may look too abstract for students.The international work is called into life with a clear intention of seeing the participating teachers become better educators, as they share the knowledge from their own expert area with others.

It would be of high importance for young people to understand the valueand importance of volunteering, mostly because through being a volunteer, they would develop a sense of active citizenship andinterest in their local communities.Additionally, there is a lack of sense of European identity among citizens of the European Union.

Itis the experience of the team of InterCollege that even though young people living in Aalborg are generally active in thecommunity, they have a lack of interest when it comes to mobility opportunities and have difficulties to relate to issues of theEuropean Union. Many young people the team members has interacted with have a lack of European identity.It has been proven that taking part in a mobility changes the attitude of the individual towards European issues, as well as motivatesthem to be an active citizen in their local community. Through the mobilities, young people develop a healthy awareness of theirown potential and realize the importance of the action of every individual. Young people returning from mobilities have been moreactive in their communities, and were much likely to volunteer. Statistics show that young people have showed more initiative andself-awareness, and have develop a sense of connection to Europe and European Identity after having started volunteering.By interacting with the volunteers of InterCollege, who will be encouraged to meet with the local community in their free time, aswell as be expected to organize local activities aimed at young people, young people will become naturally more interested inmobility possibilities and are expected to be motivated in applying themselves. As the local activities organized by the volunteerswill be within the theme of active citizenship, entrepreneurship and European identity, they will act the main tools for theirpromotion.The aim of this project is to promote mobility and to foster volunteerism in Europe through active participation.The aim will be reached through the following objectives:1. Promoting mobility opportunities for young people.2. Promoting positive awareness of the European Union among young people.3. Promoting European identity among young people, both in program and partner countries.4. Promoting active citizenship and volunteerism among young people.The selected volunteers all have experiences with youth work to some extent, either as a participant of youth mobility or as anorganizer of a project activity. They all expressed their interest in gaining experience with project management and interculturalprojects. They would also like to engage themselves in the local community, and learn as much about Denmark and Aalborg aspossible. All of the volunteers would like to engage themselves within the youth sector after their EVS and applied toInterCollege in the hopes that they will acquire the necessary skills and competences.All the participants have been working as volunteers before in their free time, therefore, they have experienced the positiveoutcomes of it, however, they feel that they need to demonstrate their dedication even further. Participating in EVS will give themthis opportunity, as they will be involved in full-time volunteerism.It is expected that through interaction with the volunteers and as a result of their dissemination, the numbers of mobilitiesacross Europe will be higher. As a consequence to that, young people over Europe will become more aware of the importance ofbeing an active citizen, the positive effects of volunteering and develop an enhanced level of European identity.", "http://www.kasyouthhub.org", null, "erasmus_2016-2-DK01-KA105-022376_3"]]}}}}
