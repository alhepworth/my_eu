In today\u2019s Europe it is highly important to talk about and protest for peace-making.\r\nThis does not accrue only in humanitarian actions but also young people expressing their longing for peace and the acceptance of differences in a colourful group using their own abilities. \r\nThroughout the project the young people will have the chance not only to know the culture of others but to improve their personalities and take part of an intensive learning process.

The project involves volunteers from 2 EU countries (Germany and Spain) travelling to the UK for a year to volunteer full-time in various projects based in local communities. The volunteers will be given lots of support by people in their local communities as well as Time For God, and will be able to develop their skills and improve their knowledge as well as benefitting the local communities. \r\nTime For God has built strong partnerships with organisations in the sending countries (Germany and Spain) who will help to recruit the volunteers and prepare them for the experience, as welll as supporting them during the project. \r\nThe project is designed to meet the following objectives:   \r\n-  Challenge young people to become actively involved in society by \u2018being there\u2019 and caring for others, especially those on the edge of society\r\n- Give the volunteer new skills and work experience through volunteering\r\n- Develop the volunteer\u2019s capacity to work, and/or live in, groups/teams\r\n- Get to know the British culture, people and language \u2018from the inside\u2019\r\n- Promote intercultural dialogue between young people (in the volunteer group, but also in the local community of which the volunteer is part)\r\n- Challenge the volunteer to reflect critically on his/her spirituality and be open to other religions & ways of life \r\n- Benefit the Receiving Organisation with the enthusiasm and cross cultural experience of a volunteer, who is able to augment the work of paid staff members with energy, new perspectives and time to build relationships with the community/ client group being served. \r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that this project will involve 14 volunteers, who will have a range of socio-economic backgrounds. In particular Time For God will encourage participation from volunteers who may otherwise struggle to access opportunities for higher education or work experience, whether this is due to geographical reasons, health problems or economic obstacles. It is hoped that the project will be accessed by an equal number of male and female volunteers. \r\n\r\nThe actual tasks that each volunteer will be involved in will vary depending on where they are based, but each placement will involve an element of service to others. At  the Cambridge URC placement, the volunteer will spend time working in a community caf\u00e9 alongside people with learning difficulties. The participants at SPEC will help with (and eventually lead) groups of children and young people at the retreat centre, encouraging them to try new activities and improving their self confidence. At the House of Light and Oakham Lodge Trust projects, participants will work in a home for adults with learning disabilties, helping them with daily tasks as well as creating new activity programmes based on the volunteers\u2019 own interests and skills. Volunteers at Wolverhampton Lea Road and Morley Community Church will be involved in a range of community activties which include working with youth groups, visiting the elderley and reaching out to disadvantaged groups. The projects at Marylebone Church Army, Yeldall Manor and Edinburgh Bethany all involve supporting people who are vulnerable through homelessness or recovering from addictions. All volunteers willl be given comprehensive training and ongoing support and supervision to help them manage the challenges of this type of work. \r\n\r\nSeveral methods will be used to monitor the success of the project and gain feedback on the learning achieved by the participants. These methods include the Youthpass tool, Time For God\u2019s On Arrival Checklist and Mid Term Review documents, and online surveys.

Solas Project has a strong reputation both within the community and with partnering community organisations for building relationships with young people. The children which Solas Project supports have been identified as the most in need of a community which faces social and economic disadvantage. Afterschool clubs provide an opportunity for stability, nutrition, healthy peer and adult relationship building, exposure to new activities to promote confidence, and support for young people to meet their full potential. \r\nSolas Project also has extensive experience working with and supporting short and long term volunteers. Volunteers make up the heart of the organisation, numbering over 150 volunteers in the 2016-2017 school year. The impact that EVS volunteers have on the children and the community is a special one. Similarly, the kids have a special impact on the volunteers. While the kids can exhibit challenging behaviours, partially due to their own challenging environments, volunteers routinely say the best part of their experience was spending time with kids and the fun they had with them. \r\n\r\nThe objectives for the project include:\r\n\u2022 Providing support through energetic long term volunteers to Solas Project\u2019s work with children and young people in South Inner City Dublin- with a focus to meetings its 5 objectives for children.\r\n\u2022 Encouraging a spirit of mutual learning for volunteers where they are supported in their learning and development while also supporting the learning and development of the children they are working with.\r\n\u2022 To further the values of Europe by supporting cultural sharing and widening the horizons of work and travel for volunteers, as well as the upcoming generation of children and young people in South Inner City Dublin. \r\n\u2022 Building both the personal and career capabilities of EVS volunteers who come to participate.\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants:\r\nThe project will involve 3 EVS participants. Participants will be a mix of male and female, with one male and one female starting in September, to be joined by a third person of either gender in January. They should be enthusiastic about working with children and young people and willing to learn and try new skills. \r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nThe Club strives to be \u2018a home away from home\u2019. Sitting around a table having a meal, helping with homework, doing a fun activity together \u2013 in all these ways we are striving to create a loving environment that is safe, peaceful, encouraging, stimulating and constructive. We support children to grow up to be healthy, confident and caring members of their community. Volunteers will have the opportunity to lead activities, plan for trips, and participate in the office support of the programme. Other activity opportunities exist in The Bridge, to help young people transition to secondary school, in Solas Sport and Solas at School, in Step Up, one to one mentoring for secondary school students, and in The Yard, leading woodworking workshops for schools. The aim for all activities is to develop relationships, to broaden horizons and experience, and to build confidence and self-worth.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nWe will work with sending organisations to identify, prepare, and place volunteers in the most suitable activity for their experience and interest. Their placements are flexible to suit the interests of the volunteer and the needs of the programmes. Volunteers will be supported in three main aspects once at Solas Project. First, by the volunteer manager who will ensure they are integrating well to Solas Project and Dublin. Second, by the programme manager who will provide daily supervision to help with challenges in their work with children. And thirdly, by an external mentor who will support their personal development. Informal and non-formal learning will be ongoing driven by the volunteer's goals. Volunteers will work on Youthpass as means of goal development during their participation and offered the opportunity to complete it at the end.\r\n\r\nResults and Impact\r\nFirstly, the impact for the children is in the meeting of their basic needs for safety, health, stability, learning and fun with consistent adults and environment. It is in the broadening of their horizons through cultural sharing and awareness of opportunities. Secondly, the impact for volunteers is in the building of transferable skills for future study or employment, as well as in their own confidence and personal development. It is an opportunity for them to broaden their own horizons, experience a new culture and fully immerse themselves in the Dublin community. We also hope there will be a long term benefit to the larger community from sharing of cultures. We hope that the volunteers will go back to their own communities and bring with them some of what they experienced in Dublin.", "http://www.timeforgod.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-IE01-KA105-025743_2"], [2015, "EVS-T\u00f8nsberg Youth work", "Time For God", 23759.0, 5, 5, "The volunteers that will be working at T\u00f8nsberg Kirkelige Fellesr\u00e5d, will be connected to the Cathedral Cafe.

In the project the volunteers will have space to create and realise their own projects what will help in converging of Europe and their citizens.   \r\n\r\nNowadays - in the socialy isolated society - it is necessary for real people to meet real people, to meet them FACE to FACE.

Therefore - we want the volunteer to come and be a good example for people in our cultural context\r\n- we want to deepen EU awareness with personal example.

These can happen through dialogues, games, songs, presentations, etc. This will be connected with realisation of international European meetings. \r\n\r\nThe second level is the regional level which involves the town P\u00fachov (20.000 citizens), village Z\u00e1rie\u010die (800 citizens), village Lazy pod Makytou (1.400), Pova\u017esk\u00e1 Bystrica (42.000 citizens) and others.

In these towns and villages there will be organised also some international European meetings that will increase European awareness and the programme Erazmus +. The volunteers will participate in realization of different youth meetings (many of them are in small villages) in the area from Myjava region to Martin region where they will inter alia present their EVS service. \r\n\r\nThe third level is the national level that includes for example projects Helping Hand (based on outdoor activities and experiencing of pedagogic supporting of a healthy life style) and Semfest (national youth open-air festival) where above mentioned focuses will be integrated in different ways.   \r\n\r\nThe third level is the national level that includes national projects like Helping Hand, Meet God, Semfest orSport olympiade, where there will be space to integrate above mentioned focuses.", "http://www.timeforgod.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SK02-KA105-001309_3"], [2016, "Educational development for inner city children and youths.", "Time For God", 22192.0, 4, 5, "Context / Background: The vision of the project is based around the work of the host - the Solas Project.

Since young people are and will always be the trendsetters in any kind of new development, we hope that building bridges will become a trend to bind together for the sake of a better future and a better world. But a better world does not begin on Mars or in Brussels; it starts in our own local communities. So that is where the mission of Bridgebuilding needs to begin. And it will begin with young people. Because young people today are facing many challenges that seem impossible to overcome, we need the whole community to come together to support youth. There are many kinds of bridges to be built. Not just the youth who are most likely to succeed as they have the grades, the status and  the money, but also the young people who face the greater challenges of poverty and unemployment and whose future looks dim. \r\n\r\nThe youth culture today is not easily defined and understood.  Therefore youth work today requires effort, constant analysis and diligent discipline to work out the nuts and bolts on how to best lead and guide young people to be motivated, principled and caring citizens of this world and of Europe. With this in mind we are organising a training programme called the Youth Work Factory.\r\nFrom the region of SouthWestern part of the Netherlands where Atlantic Bridge finds its home, we want to build a strong network that not only reaches across Europe but also to North America. This is nothing less than an effort to improve the quality of youth work in our western world. \r\nBut we need to start small. We start by bringing together three people from seven different countries. We will train and guide these teams to build effective local work in their own local communities a whole year long. And we will support them in this process through the year.  We will evaluate the year with local exchanges and a final event in the summer of 2016. \r\n\r\nOur methodology is to create new small teams of youth (Bridgebuilders) focused on building bridges, They are armed with a curriculum to train them in this art and discipline. At the same time a regional team of adults, parents and friends is started in support of these teams and its youth leaders. As they learn the blessings of a global society they apply these acquired attitudes and skills to their local community setting, building positive communities focused on mutual respect, coorperation, faith, hope, peace and love. At these communities are impacted we plan for a growth of these teams locally and on a European scale. \r\n\r\nThe heart of this mission is about love, hope, faith and peace. These are the Christian values that help build a better world. But these values are challenged today with the increase of selfishness, greed, need for control etc. which are often at the heart of the increasing polarization today. Perhaps it is time that we return to the values that have built up Europe to what it is today, a continent in great demand by people from other continents to come to and live in!  A Europe of tolerance, individual dignity, brotherly love, equality and peace, values deeply rooted in Christianity. But young people today are losing these values as they lose their connection to their Christian heritage. And so we hope that the churches that are the guardians of these values across the last two millennia, will join our effort to build a revitalised positive youth work so needed in our world today.", "http://www.timeforgod.org", null, "erasmus_2015-2-NL02-KA105-001030_1"], [2014, "Empowering European Youth", "Time For God", 9672.0, 4, 4, "Our project, Empowering European Youth, with acredited number 2012-ES-106 will focus on urban / rural development, communication and information for young people.\r\nIn the project that we have designed for a period of six months, the three volunteers who will be one from Hungary, Cyprus  and France, they will have the opportunity to participate and learn form the main activities of IDEA, this activities are most related to the areas of creating new employment opportunities and to provide advice and information to young people.\r\nOur activities are in fact dedicated to the unemployed and especially young people who are struggling to find a foothold in the labour market. The service \u201cLabour guide\u201d of IDEA is working on the design and development of training programmes through workshops, seminars and interviews. The aim of this service is to prepare young people to meet the new demands of the labour market.\r\n In this perspective, the volunteers will participate in the daily activities of IDEA (workshops and seminars, etc. ..). For example, they will be able to help young people to find new labour opportunities using the Eures Network which is the website for the labour mobility in Europe, after they have received all the information about how the system works. It is important to note that the experience of IDEA will be useful for volunteers and expand their opportunities for the future. Furthermore, it will be possible to create a group of young people to make an intercultural laboratory in IDEA. The volunteers will be able to use their experiences, especially with young people, sharing with them their opinions, in this process the volunteers can also increase their knowledge of Spanish culture.\r\nThe volunteers will improve their professional profiles (in the field of youth European projects and employment) and enriching the general knowledge of European citizenship.", "http://www.timeforgod.org", null, "erasmus_2014-3-ES02-KA105-005269_1"]]}}}}
