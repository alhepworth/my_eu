VBP15 will increase the therapeutic window to slow disease progression and improve quality of life and lifespan for all DMD patients. \nBuilding on positive preclinical and Phase 1 results funded by government grants and international patient groups and based on FDA and EMA advice, VISION-DMD proposes a Phase 2 registration directed clinical programme aimed at an affordable therapy: Phase 2a will study the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of VBP15 in ambulant DMD boys; Phase 2b will demonstrate the efficacy and safety of two doses of VBP15 in young ambulant DMD boys.

Students from the 6 participating schools in England, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary and Poland will be given preparation of the highest quality, not only for their leaving examinations and career choice, but also in their school life where they will become familiar with learning techniques which will enable them to acquire knowledge as they follow their learning and career pathways. This will take place principally through the use of modern learning methods and learning environments, such as digital learning platforms. \r\nThe foundations for intellectual  \u2018fitness\u2019 can be seen in reading skills, linguistic ability, clear expertise in STEM subjects, as well as important social skills, including self-confidence and the ability to work as part of a team. \r\nBecause the content of these subjects changes quickly the focus of this project is aimed at the methods used to convey information.\r\nIn each year of the project one theme will be covered in depth. During the annual planning meetings participating teachers and students will exchange ideas about the methods employed so far, the application of digital media and, where necessary, will develop new pedagogical methodologies.\r\nIn the course of the year any newly acquired methodology and digital media will be observed by the partner schools and then tested. If applicable, during project meetings, new common methodologies can be developed with the teaching staff from the host school, and plans for further digital collaboration in a particular subject can be drafted.\r\nDuring the year, this exchange, together with any additional ideas, will lead to online platforms such as E-twinning, Google classroom or Adobe Connect.\r\nAt the end of each project year, an evaluation meeting will then take place, the results of which should be, amongst other things:  a programme of study designed to employ teaching methods which are appropriate within the specific field; a possible school partnership within the framework of modern foreign language teaching; building blocks which can be used digitally for STEM subjects, or a catalogue of suitable instruments for successful career preparation in school.\r\nThe expertise of teachers as specialists in methodology is just as important as that of the students who can judge the effectiveness and acceptance of the methodology amongst the student body. \r\nThe theme of the first project-year is linguistic competence. Reading skills in the mother language, especially in relation to the reading of factual texts, as well as the learning of foreign languages should be developed. This will be used especially for developing new, digital methods which develop independent learning at one\u2019s own pace.\r\nThe second project year is devoted to the teaching of STEM subjects. Alongside the fundamental competencies of arithmetic and scientific ways of working and thinking, the production (through research) and interpretation of data should be developed.  Methodologies supported by technology should preferably be employed, which will develop the students\u2019 skills in using different media, as well as their specialist knowledge.\r\nThe focus of the third year is students\u2019 preparation for their working life. This includes their first contact with the world of work (information events, work placements, student enterprises, etc.) as well as the learning of so-called soft skills. Students should be able to analyse their strengths and weaknesses and use their strengths to support their own success and for that of their team.  Finally, they should fully appreciate their competencies and with the help of the European pass also their position on the European job market.\r\nFurthermore, through their overseas visits, students should make new contacts, get to know new surroundings, try out their foreign languages in authentic situations, and investigate opportunities for their professional future through short work experience placements. \r\nAs far as the institutions are concerned, the project should contribute to each of the partner school\u2019s development, particularly where the direction of teaching and learning in the digital age is concerned.\r\nThis improvement in teaching, measurable through students\u2019 improved achievement, should contribute to improving the position of schools which find themselves in competition.\r\nThe successful implementation of the project\u2019s ideas can have a regional impact within the vicinity of the school itself, whilst the schools will act as a source of methodological innovation and as a place of exchange of European values.\r\nThe publishing of the project\u2019s results, above all the programmes of study covering methodology - for example, on the internet platform of Erasmus+, can extend this impact to an international level. The results can serve other colleges as an inspiration for their own development plan.", "http://www.wkgs.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035657_2"]]}}, "8AP": {"cordis": {"data": [[1451606400000, 1577750400000, "VISION-DMD - Phase 2 Clinical Trials of VBP15: An Innovative Steroid-like Intervention on Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy", "Ceratium Limited", "VISION-DMD aims to advance clinical development of the orphan drug VBP15 as a new therapy to revolutionise care for all patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) by 2020, in line with IRDiRC goals.

There are no approved drugs to treat this disease. After Orphan Drug Designation Protocol Assistance was requested from the European Medicines Agency on our drug development research plan. The proposed protocol incorporates the EMA advice and will include a non-clinical phase, a double-blind placebo controlled Phase I trial and a randomised double-blind, active controlled, parallel groups Phase 3 study (efficacy and safety therapeutic confirmatory study).  The primary deliverables will be: 1) experimental scientific evidence on the quality, safety and efficacy of PHMB to provide the basis for a Marketing Authorisation within 5 years; 2) recommendations aiming to improve clinical practices in the management of AK based on the efficacy and safety evidence.

In particular, through identifying optimal PHMB formulations and recommending the best dose-benefit treatment regimes. ODAK directly contributes to the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium goal towards 200 new therapies.
