We commit in the future projection of our students, through the synergies from whom we share the same interests.\r\nBELE (Bilboko Euskal Lutheria Eskola-Basque School of Violin Making) is integrated in the Conservatory of Music \u201cJuan Cris\u00f3stomo Arriaga\u201d of Bilbao and is the only school in Spain where violin making is imparted (Making and restoration of bowed instruments - violin, viola and cello-, level III of Professional Qualifications). This school is attended by students from all over Spain.\r\nIn 2013 we began the way to renewal. Our aim was to overcome the difficulties of labor insertion, through an ambitious plan which improves the quality of the students' training with a new Curriculum, the improvement of the competences of the teaching staff, the provision of human resources, as well as material and economic resources, practical training in qualified workshops, etc. On the other hand we carried out actions to achieve this quality recognition by sector professionals, both workshops and professional musicians. In short, it\u2019s a strategic plan to grow in quality and prestige, and thus improve the employability of our students.\r\nFor this purpose, in 2016 we carried out our first student and staff mobility project as well as another project of strategic partnerships for innovation. This is our second year in our internationalization path. The achieved progresses reaffirm us in the validity of the undertaken itinerary and are positively answering the detected needs of quality and prestige as reflected in our Strategic Plan 2015-2020. The link with schools, professionals and companies from other European countries is helping BELE to improve its quality and to have a greater and better presence in the sector.  As a result  up today, we can say that our students training and their recognition abroad is better improving their employability.\r\nWe are weaving a network of relationships between professionals, training centers and workshops, based on mutual trust. We all share the same improvement , growth, quality and efficiency interests for the sector, and the market demands. Sharing and connecting we are wiser, more creative, more skillful, more efficient. All this will provide a better response to the needs of the sector, musicians, training centers and, essentially, our students.\r\nWe request twelve mobilities in the current project in order to continue and enhance this dynamic. Six of them are students mobilities, four of them for staff job-shadowing and another  two for experts teaching. Our collaborating partners are companies, workshops, training centers and professionals from the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal, Sweden and France, with strong roots, long tradition and prestige in the sector. During the last year we have incorporated six new partners and nowadays we have fifteen companies and a training center in our directory.\r\nIn this current project we have made a strong commitment  to extend the stay of our students abroad through the new ErasmusPro mobility modality. We want to promote greater integration in the company, better training and also increase employment opportunities.\r\nWe are aware of the ambitious nature of our Project. That is why we have articulated all the necessary mechanisms to achieve the objectives, starting with the adequate selection and preparation of participants and partners, continuing with the correct programming of mobilities, effective monitoring and coordination, and with the evaluation and final dissemination.\r\nOur first mobilities have been and are being successful, well programed and coordinated, with very satisfactory results for all parties involved. They are achieving an improvement in the training of the participants and, what is more important, they are implying a decisive impulse to the employability of the students, with good results of labor insertion.

In response, traditional subject-based teaching is slowly being replaced by training through scenarios, such as Problem-Based Learning (PBL), which is more closely aligned with the needs of practice. But the missing factor is the ability for the learner to directly engage with the scenario; to take decisions and experience the consequences of those decisions; to learn safely through error.Interactive virtual scenarios (VS) or simulations (Scenario-Based Learning; SBL) are recognised by many teaching and learning communities as effective tools for developing reasoning, and for safe training in workplace competency.

The iCIRRUS C-RAN introduces the use of Ethernet in the fronthaul/midhaul (for radio signal transport), to minimise cost and make available pluggable and in-device monitoring, and intelligent processing to enable self-optimizing network functions which maximise both network resource utilisation and energy efficiency. To exemplify the attractiveness of the proposition, iCIRRUS focusses on D2D communication in the wireless domain, an important work area in current standardisation, where low latency is known to be a significant factor. The latency and jitter in the iCIRRUS Ethernet-based C-RAN will be an important focus of the research work in the project, with current 5G performance targets in mind; for D2D communications, the task will be to minimise control latency and overhead. A major obstacle for C-RANs is the bit-rate of the digitised radio signals that would be required for 5G \u2013 of the order of 100 Gb/s and iCIRRUS will examine the architectural and technological questions surrounding this requirement.

The EU consume 3,361.69 TWh of electricity p.a and that is growing, as is our reliance on imported energy.  EU supply standard EN 50160 has been harmonised at a single phase line voltage of 230Vac \u00b110%,  Consequently actual voltages differ significantly across Europe with from 220Vac, through 230 to 240Vac, with peak mean voltages up to 253Vac.

This \u2018over voltage\u2019 leads to inefficiency and  losses, (heat, eddy currents, magnetic hysteresis), increased energy bills, increased maintenance, down-time and reduced equipment life. These problems can be solved by reducing and stabilising the line voltage at the point of use, results in energy savings up to 20% if the input line voltage is 253V (230V\\10%), thus representing a significant opportunity to reduce electricity bills.

The establishment of Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks and installing Offshore Wind Farms (OWF) are important ways to achieve these goals. The protection and management of marine biodiversity has focused on placing MPAs in areas important for biodiversity. This has proved successful within the MPAs, but had little impact beyond their boundaries. In the highly populated Mediterranean and the Black Seas, bordered by many range states, the declaration of extensive MPAs is unlikely at present, so limiting the bearing of protection. The establishment of MPAs networks can cope with this obstacle but, to be effective, such networks must be based on solid scientific knowledge and properly managed (not merely \u201cpaper parks\u201d). OWF, meanwhile, must be placed where the winds are suitable for producing power, but they should not have any significant impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, or on human activities. The project will have two main themes:\n1 - identify prospective networks of existing or potential MPAs in the Mediterranean and the Black Seas, shifting from a local perspective (centred on single MPAs) to the regional level (network of MPAs) and finally the basin scale (network of networks). The identification of the physical and biological connections among MPAs will elucidate the patterns and processes of biodiversity distribution. Measures to improve protection schemes will be suggested, based on maintaining effective exchanges (biological and hydrological) between protected areas.
