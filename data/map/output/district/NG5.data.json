Actually 56 training centers (in 8 regions) have joined this project. Its effectiveness lies in the fact that the parties involved have known one another for a long while, exchange know-how, pool best practices, develop common actions/tools (communication campaign, methodology, management\u2026).

CCIs, their apprentice training centres and partners are fully persuaded that mobility, even if only for short periods, makes the apprenticeship pathway more attractive and ensures that it is just as highly considered as traditional school-based learning.\r\nThe effectiveness of the project lies in the fact that the parties involved (CCI France, local/regional CCIs, apprentice training centres) have known one another for a long while, exchange know-how, pool best practices and produce valuable tools and resources (communication/management/methods\u2026).

These mobility assignments are of short duration as they take place during training and must therefore be compatible with the rhythm of the apprenticeships organisation and also require the employer\u2019s approval.\r\nFrom a professional viewpoint, the goals of mobility are discovering new working environments and of course gaining self-confidence. From a personal viewpoint, the main impacts are achieving a better understanding of the European area and modifying one's behaviour (improving tolerance, curiosity and adaptability\u2026).\r\n\r\n* Post-apprentices. These are young people graduated (level V to I qualifications in all business sectors) from the apprentice training centers of the CCI and their partners who have completed their apprenticeship contract during the last 12 months. They are registered at the French unemployment service, registration that qualify them as \u201ctrainee undertaking vocational training\u201d. \r\nA long-duration mobility placement enables those people to improve their employability by upgrading their skills, particularly linguistic skills, and their adaptability in the international labour market.\r\n\r\n*Trainers.

To boost this policy, the region received significant support from the LEONARDO program since 2009.

It will also develop mobility to vocation \"Certification\" in order to enhance the recognition of acquired skills. The Region proposes in this context a strong support for CFA: 1 / the proposed technical assistance to the CFA for the development, monitoring and evaluation of their projects: Many CFA remains little - if at all for some - experienced in European mobility projects. It is therefore to support the structures / teaching staff in the engineering of the project on the educational aspects (linguistic and cultural preparations initially, Europass, etc.), logistical and budget to finalize qualitatively valid nominations and financially eligible.

The region Hauts-de-France has nearly 6 million inhabitants, which represents 9.4% of the population of metropolitan France.

The new region is characterized by its youth with the highest proportion of under-25-year-olds and student attractiveness. Raising the level of training remains a significant objective for the new region while, at the same time, the number of school leavers without qualifications is still above the national average. While the rate of unemployment is below the national average from the level V, the lack of training is a major handicap in the career and for the integration into the workplace.

The background to our project perfectly meets our will to join forces in order to continue and amplify an action initiated in 1995 in Aquitaine. The latter promotes the professional inclusion of young people engaged in vocational training.\r\n\r\nOur method: Planning the integration of students in their final year in a European mobility project (long-term traineeships for instance), which may enhance their qualification and confront the competences they have acquired to the realities on the ground.\r\n\r\nWe can find support in numerous \u201cLeonardo\u201d programmes, managed by the ADAST (Transnational Traineeships development Organisation in Aquitaine). Historically, this organisation founded on the 1901 legislation has managed projects in the context of a complementary training programme initiated regionally, hosted by the Gustave Eiffel school in Bordeaux. 1,400 trainees have benefitted from European mobility projects in this way.\r\n\r\nConcerned with meeting national legal imperatives and improving regional clarity, the school will implement the project and thereby become the consortium's coordinator.\r\n\r\nFor its part, the European Union has fully understood the importance of preserving a substantial transnational experience, allowing activities for mobility 12 months after obtaining a diploma.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Aquitaine institutions, namely the Local Education Authority, the Regional Council, and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, will provide the new Consortium project with human, financial and logistical support, as was the case previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Consortium's aims:\r\n\r\nThis grouping of more than 20 establishments, committed to the same support approach towards employability, has defined a set of general aims, which are:\r\n\r\n\u2022 pooling individual knowledge and skills to carry out added value investments\r\n\r\n\u2022 inviting collaborating local firms to a transnational support approach aiming at future recruitment in Aquitaine or within European branches\r\n\r\n\u2022 enhancing the level of required competences as well as adaptability for a sustained integration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManaging the project:\r\n\r\nCollective management; defined tasks, annual planning; grouping by business or industry sectors and centralizing in Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nThe determination of institutions, willing to maintain job training, will allow our youths to gain the experience they lack when leaving school. Local integration is sufficient for the consortium to be operational from the first year.\r\n\r\nBecause the implementation of the new programmes for the 2014-2020 period is still uncertain, a selection has been carried out to limit the number of participating senior secondary schools, in order to introduce a new participatory approach. This will ensure that preparation to mobility activities can be internally provided during the final year.\r\n\r\nWe are now half-way into the preparation of participants. A few doubts remain for a few, which lie in the fact that they haven't obtained their diploma yet, but also that they still have to be selected by our hosting partners in a number of fields. The mistakes made during the first session will serve to change our selection and preparation for the 2015 generation. This is why a 24-month project is most interesting.\r\n\r\nThe latest working meeting on March, 4th, bringing together the members of the consortium, has made it possible to put forward each member's expectations, to examine the preparation work already achieved and to define a common course of action as well as general specifications.\r\n\r\nAs concerns the management of traineeship information, we are currently working on a specific software programme that has given us full satisfaction over the past years and that will allow us to process all statistic data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nThe network of participants insists on making it easier for young people with a vocational degree in Aquitaine to find a job, following an efficiency system based on the participation of firms that have acknowledged the advantage of this form of training.\r\n\r\nThe results we expect are a modest 50% of immediate employment. Our network of local businesses must be expanded and requires more intense lobbying.\r\n\r\nThe eligibility of mobility projects is a constant concern. We shall begin with Europass mobility and\r\n\r\nthe regional certificate for additional training implemented by the regional education authority, both being diploma supplements.\r\n\r\nThis first experience and first implementation should lead us to a better assessment of the period, in particular thanks to existing tools such as the ECVET (European Credit system for Vocational Education and Training)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we expect to boost the development of relationships between schools and businesses, which will allow each establishment to foresee the type and number of young people in a position to profit from mobility.", "http://www.destination.eu.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-001844_2"], [2015, "ERASMUS+ ARTISANAT Pays de la Loire 2015", "Destination Europe", 301085.0, 8, 11, "The project \" ERASMUS + CRAFT PAYS DE LA LOIRE \" is supported by the Regional Chamber of Trades and Crafts Pays de la Loire.\r\nIt involves three sending organizations that are the Regional Chamber of Trades and Crafts Pays de la Loire, the Apprentice Training Centre in esthetic hairstyle Loire -Atlantique and the Apprentice Training Centre in hairstyle Sarthe.\r\n\r\nThe r\u00e9gional Chambers of Trades and Crafts  include the Chambers of Trades and Crafts of Loire- Atlantique, Mayenne , Maine-et-Loire, Sarthe and Vend\u00e9e .\r\n\r\nThese five Chambers of Trades and Crafts manage all an Apprentice Training Centre (CFA) , respectively in Nantes , Laval , Angers, Le Mans and La Roche -sur- Yon.\r\n\r\nThe project consists mainly to offer the opportunities for apprentices  crafts and for young graduates from CFA to go on mobility :\r\n    - 142 apprentices will go out in group mobility on short stays of two weeks ,\r\n    - 41 graduates will go on individual mobility on long stays of 6 months.\r\nDuring the period of mobility , youth will realize a training in a host company .\r\n\r\nShort breaks will be supervised by a total of 33 coaches , personal of the CFA .\r\n\r\nThe European mobility referents of CFA, the regional coordinator and other company personnel  also leave training with European partners , representing 31 mobilities.\r\n\r\nWe shall also organize a stay of observation in England for employers and coach, to make them become aware profits of the mobility for the apprentices.\r\n\r\nApprentices are all between 17 and 20 years.
