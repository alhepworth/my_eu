This will include seven 'priority' habitat types, such as fixed coastal dunes, ravine and alluvial forests and yew woodlands, raised and blanket bogs and calcareous fens, plus a further 18 habitat types ranging from sea cliffs, heaths and grasslands, to oak and beech woodlands and open mountain habitats. These habitats occur in a series of 20 potential NATURA 2000 sites throughout Wales, for which monitoring programmes and baseline data will be produced. The final output from the work will be a series of publications on the monitoring methodology and training in its application for the benefit of NATURA 2000 site managers elsewhere in the Community.The effectiveness of the Habitats Directive in ensuring the protection of those habitat types and species of European importance listed in its annexes I and II can only be judged if the habitats and species are monitored adequately. While there already exists some experience on the monitoring of a range of habitat types, no work has, as yet, been undertaken to develop standards for monitoring in support of the Directive. As the network of Special Areas of Conservation (NATURA 2000) will form a vital foundation for the conservation of these habitats and species, it is important that monitoring programmes are developed to determine their favourable conservation status. \n\nBy targeting the proposed SACs in Wales, this project aims to develop a standardised and efficient habitat monitoring programme linked with management plans for NATURA 2000 sites in the Region which can act as a demonstration tool for other areas within the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=64", null, "life_26"]]}}, "6SA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Learning and Teaching Together", "TYF Connect CIC", 210943.0, 3, 19, "The partner local authorities aim to take an innovative  strategic view  to reinforce our education  systems and to improve collaboration internally as well as with parents and other external stakeholders.  At systemic level, we expect to awaken a modernisation of education.  \r\n\r\nThrough this project we will engage and widen the school community and reinforce our response to the main challenges of today's world in particular active participation in democratic life by realising and owning change. \r\n\r\nSchools will be developed as Learning & Thinking centres of excellence from which the wider community can play an important role in the educational standards of our young learners. By combining life skills with thinking skills and vision for the future we will inspire engagement thus raising standards amongst our pupils especially those who are considered disadvantaged.  Through these actions we will support schools in tackling lack of engagement which often leads to early school leaving. In addition we will engage local businesses to help support our local communities in gaining the appropriate skills set.\r\n\r\nWe have a combined  vision with regard to empowering and supporting  achievement amongst young people, their families and the wider community. This vision is applicable to all and will underpin all activities in order that all participants achieve their full potential.  We want to demonstrate the value that can be created when teachers give young people the practical skills to solve real challenges be.\r\n\r\nThe plan has 3 strands:\r\nStrand 1 - Upskilling Teachers, Pupils and Engaging the Community\r\nIn the initial stages of our project we upskill teachers in effective Thinking Skills in the classroom.\r\nAs this project will be largely led by pupils the next stage will be to upskill pupils in essential thinking skills.\r\nOnce trained pupils will approach members of the wider community to look at ways in which they can improve their locality and identify the skills they need in order to meet their goals.  \r\nWe have included job-shadowing and training for teachers.\r\nStrand 2- Developing Leaning & Thinking Together (LTT) schools\r\nOnce the required skill set is identified we will put into place the necessary intergenerational community training programmes in which pupils will disseminate their new skills and gaining additional skills by engaging in these events.  Wherever possible local businesses and entrepreneurs will be included sharing their expertise and offering work experience opportunities to older students. We will involve families from the school community and the wider community.\r\nTraining events will be held within the participating schools and the community will be encouraged to come together in intergenerational learning and making progress towards our goal of developing participating schools as LTT centres of excellence.\r\nTeachers from partner schools will take part in job-shadowing and pupils will take part in pupil exchange visits to partner countries. \r\nStrand 3 - Action Community Project\r\nIn this final part of the project schools will work together with the wider communities to put into play the actions they have deemed important and necessary for the wellbeing of pupils and residents in the local area. \r\nA focus will be put on the skills learned by pupils and the participating adults.  \r\nOnce complete the projects will be disseminated in multiplier events in each region.  These events will serve as a celebration of the good practice shared but also a further opportunity to encourage other schools in our regions to engage in similar activities.\r\nThere is no doubt that by cooperating together and sharing skills, experiences and competences between the partner regions the project outcomes will be significantly reinforced. This partnership project will help all participants to a more positive attitude towards the EU and its values.", "http://www.tyf.com", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013502_3"]]}}}}
