In Europe this has been taken into account in curriculums widely but too often ESD education is considered as an \u2018add on\u2019. Instead it should be a natural and essential part of school culture in order to educate students towards a sustainable way of life. In this project - the different dimensions of school culture are explored in an international context - the school culture of every project school as well as the skills and pedagogy of the staff is developed- -the general guidelines for school are composed in order to become better ESD school. In analyzing the school culture we will use Schoen\u2019s model (2005), which divides school culture into four key dimensions: 1) professional orientation, 2) organizational structure (leadership and management), 3) teaching and learning, 4) student-orientated activities. Each project meeting will focus on one of these areas and school-specific developmental work will be created. The purpose of the developmental work is to create a school culture that enables and promotes ESD in schools. The Final output of the project will be the guidebook called \u2018A Roadmap to an ESD School\u2019. This book will provide clear and achievable guidance on how to embed the principles and practice of ESD into everyday school culture across Europe.There are four schools taking part in this project, from Finland, Great Britain, Iceland and Belgium. Each of the selected partner schools has been committed to ESD for many years and is well known for this work within their local communities. Each partner school has been selected for the strengths and expertise it has in specific areas of ESD.  Each school has engaged a complimentary specialist external partner with a remit to promote ESD. The partner organisations will provide expertise to support the implementation of the planned Erasmus project and will work with schools for the duration of the project.The project will be implemented in schools at three levels: management level, teacher level and student level. The project work will be informed by a rigorous survey cycle, including an initial and final survey. Surveys will involve a range of stakeholders including students and parents and will be used to inform action plans and measure impact of work done. School managers will be responsible for implementing action plans during the development cycle of the project, teachers will be trained to deliver comprehensive ESD education, and students will participate in ESD education and share their experiences with other project schools. There will be one project meeting arranged in every project country and the final meeting is arranged by the coordinator. Alongside and to successfully implement this work, there will be four international teacher training courses. Professional development for teachers will be arranged in the project countries. The training will focus on the four themes of ESD. As teachers develop their pedagogical and methodological abilities, so students will get improved, quality learning experiences in in all areas of ESD.", "http://www.clunprimaryschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FI01-KA201-022692_1"]]}}, "8PG": {"cordis": {"data": [[1301616000000, 1459382400000, "Sustainable Organic and Low-input Dairying (SOLID)", "Institute of Organic Training and Advice Ltd", "Organic and low-input dairy farming systems are increasingly noted as delivering multifunctional benefits to the agricultural industry and society but technical and economic constraints prevent widespread adoption. SOLID will deliver an innovative toolbox of novel methodologies that will contribute to the competitiveness of the dairy industry and increase the effectiveness with which these benefits are delivered. SOLID facilitates the use of breeds and feeding strategies to maintain productivity, improve animal health and welfare while meeting the market requirement for high quality milk. A multidisciplinary team comprising academic and stakeholder (SME) partners from across Europe, encompassing dairy cows and goats, will identify and apply novel strategies at the farm level and throughout the supply chain. Innovative science and models, combined with a participatory approach, will tackle practical issues, and assess competitive sustainability and integration across a range of scales and geographical contexts. Proteomics combined with genotyping and calorimetry will be used to characterise and quantify dairy cow and goat breed adaptation to organic and low-input systems. Given the reliance of such systems on forage, SOLID will develop novel and sustainable feed resources and design a decision-support model to optimise the management of on-farm forage supply. Life cycle assessment tools will assess environmental sustainability of grassland-based multifunctional dairy systems.  Analysis of the supply chain from fork to farm will quantify the acceptability of new strategies and enhance collaboration. An integrated assessment tool and socio-economic modelling will assess innovations on farms and along supply chains, and will predict the impact of more widespread adoption of low-input practises. Effective knowledge dissemination and exchange activities will target key stakeholder groups ensuring exploitation of outputs at animal, farm, region, sector and European levels.", 7765.0, 6271689.0, 10, 26, "SOLID", null, "http://www.organicadvice.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/157389.jpg", "fp7_99072_983492410"]]}}}}
