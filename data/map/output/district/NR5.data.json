We are growing secondary school, with a  sixth form. We have 912 students and 160 staff.\r\n\r\nOur students are predominantly from White British backgrounds with growing numbers Black Minority Ethnic pupils. 10% of our years 7 to 11 have English as an Additional Language, significantly more compared with the numbers when we applied for our 2015 project\r\n\r\nWe completed a successful large scale Erasmus + project  (2014-1-UK101-002101) in the Summer of 2014, and detailed information on this can be found in the final report of that project. Our successful management of all aspects of that project demonstrate that we have the ability to manage the strategic, financial and professional aspects of a large project effectively.\r\n\r\nThe project has helped us to develop language, pedagogy,  training scheme development, dissemination, project and financial management skills. which we are now keen to build on.\r\n\r\nOur 2014 Erasmus+ project impacted greatly on our school life. We not only met but exceeded our targets and have created a huge change in our school in terms of quality of teaching and learning, embedding the European dimension, and supporting others. We are determined not to lose this impetus and we are clear what the next steps will be to build on our success, involving more staff and more countries\r\n\r\nThis project will involve immersion courses abroad, sending 20 members of staff to each of the following countries; Spain, France, Italy, Germany. This will be a total of 80 mobilities. We intend to involve different members of staff each time, with the exception of the International coordinator (IC) who will be involved in all 4 countries to take a lead on the development of school links and joint curricular projects, and some members of the MFL team to respond to their individual needs (i.e  some may focus particularly on one country while others may need to upskill in more than one language). Participants will represent different departments across the school and a mix of roles including teaching and support staff and senior managers.\r\n\r\nThis project will result in further fundamental changes to our approach to language teaching and integrating the European dimension in our school. Internationalism will become even further embedded and will be seen in all subject areas. Planning formats will continue to evolve to reflect changes.\r\n\r\nMore staff will be equipped with the necessary skills to embed the European dimension further and create strong links between languages and their own subject. They will have the skills to provide support for others including partner primary schools and other schools within our cluster, increasing our capacity to perform our role as a centre of excellence and support.\r\n\r\nWe will have the capacity to offer support to a greater number of local schools and will extend our role as a training provider and source of support. More staff members will be equipped with the knowledge, skills and experience to support others to improve standards within their subject. We will also be more flexible in terms of the support we can offer and the range of languages.\r\n\r\nWe will have wide representation from many departments  to fully establish the whole school approach of this project. We would like our participants to come from different roles and backgrounds within the school, for example teachers, support staff, learning partnerships staff, behaviour managers etc.\r\n\r\nWe have been conducting an evaluation of our current project, and plan to use a similar process to evaluate this one. Our approach is to set baselines against which to measure our progress in all of the areas that we want to focus on during this project. We perform evaluations during the activity to ensure that we are on track to achieve our aims and will conduct a final evaluation at the end.\r\n\r\nWe use various means of  evaluation, relevant to each area we wish to assess. These include use of formal schools performance systems, pupil voice and parents surveys, questionnaires and opinion polls. we look at children's work, teachers' planning and undertake regular, informal assessments. We use lesson observations and measure uptake of languages and extracurricular opportunities. We observe pupils' attitude towards taking part in activities and assess their reaction to proposed future developments such as pupil exchanges.

We will have the opportunity to pull together as a team across the school to ensure that we develop truly excellent practice, incorporating the best practice of Europ\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm and motivation of the staff will rub off on the pupils leading to better learning, greater uptake of languages and more ambitious students. This will lead to greater uptake of languages and a decrease in early school leaving.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this project on our school will be huge. It will create a fundamental change in our practice and will mean that we are able to push our achievements beyond outstanding. We also intend to have a wider impact including other schools within our academies network, feeder primary schools, parents and the community. The envisaged impacts will include better language skills and greater intercultural knowledge of all staff, the introduction of the European dimension right across our school, in every subject area and embedded into all our practices, the integration of best practice from observation of European colleagues into our own practice leading to better teaching and learning, increased motivation of staff leading to better pupil motivation, the development of new materials, schemes of work and training programmes, the development of a strong network of support, the introduction of CLIL and greater cooperation with feeder primaries.\r\n\r\nWe will develop excellent links with Spanish and French schools leading to great benefits for all concerned which will greatly increase pupils\u2019 motivation to learn languages and give them a much wider outlook, seeing Europe as being somewhere that is relevant to their own lives.\r\n\r\nPupils will see beyond their own immediate surroundings and embrace difference and there will be increased cooperation across departments and more cross curricular work.", "http://www.ormistonvictoryacademy.co.uk", "Ormiston Victory Academy", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002101_coordinator"]]}}, "0RR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Languages at Costessey : onwards and upwards.", "Costessey Junior School", 22791.0, 1, 1, "Costessey Junior is on the outskirts of Norwich and has 355 children.

It began its journey in September 2003. Currently, it educates 1008 students of 23 different nationalities (since our neighbourhood, which brings together the beach and the port, has become an important focus of attraction for many emigrants who work in the service sector). The studies we offer range from Compulsory Secondary Education and Baccalaureate to Professional Training Middle and Higher Degree in the following proportion:\r\n\r\nEducation Compulsory Secondary: 337\r\nBaccalaureate: 128\r\nBasic Professional Qualification Program: 11\r\nVocational Training of Medium Degree: 209\r\nHigher Professional Training: 323\r\nWe also have 105 teachers (52 CSE and BAC) I (53 PT) and 5 administrative staff and Services.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOur school is involved in a transformation process that began in September 2014 where we became a Learning Community, after being chosen by our families (99%); our students (99%) and our teaching staff (70%).  In response to the needs detected in recent years, our priority lines of intervention have focused on the development of \"inclusive\" methodologies based on the development of the 7 principles of dialogic learning, on the participation and involvement of families and our students in the decision making process in the school, with the creation of different commissions (infrastructure, pedagogy, new technologies, extracurricular activities and coexistence); in the application of different Educational Success Actions with the intention of improving results and coexistence as Interactive Groups; Literary circles; Library Tutoring; Dialogical Pedagogy Circles. These actions are proposed by the INCLUD-ED project (Strategies for inclusion and social cohesion in Europe from education that was a priority research line, level 7 project in the VI framework program of the European Commission) http: // www. includ-ed.eu/es.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThey are aimed at two areas of improvement, the educational quality of the school and the internationalization of the institution. We intend to improve the practical policies and inclusive cultures of our institution by observing other schools where they apply successful educational actions recognized by the scientific community. We want to get training in classroom practices and schedules that allow the accessibility of the curriculum to all students, especially those who are most vulnerable and with more barriers for learning and participation, thus reducing absenteeism and enabling the exchange of experiences. Creating contacts for the realization of consortiums are also part of the project's objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS: NUMBER AND PROFILE\r\nThis project is directed to the stage of secondary education, in which there are 52 teachers,  18 of them participate in the project and represent 34.6% of the global computation of secondary education teachers. All of them have a permanent position in the school and the firm commitment to continue its process of transformation.\r\nAmong the participants there is representation of the management team, the department of mathematics, spanish, biology, , technology, image, history, english, valencian, educational guidance, a specialist in therapeutic pedagogy and an expert teacher in European projects.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES\r\nTo achieve the objectives of quality and internationalization, a total of 13 mobilities will be carried out.\r\n4 mobilities of the JOB SHADOWING type and 9 mobilities of the COURSE type.\r\nThe proposed activities try to respond to the needs raised in the project in relation to the objectives of quality and internationalization.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY USED TO CARRY OUT THE PROJECT.\r\nThe active involvement of the entire faculty is of vital importance. Their participation is carried out  through commissions that manage the project or in the realization of the mobilities.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPACT\r\nOur main objective is to reduce school drop-out and increase the graduation rate in school graduates. Thus, this project responds to the transformation process of our educational community. The presence, participation and learning of the most vulnerable students at risk of social exclusion justifies the efforts towards a better school.\r\n\r\nAll our work makes sense if it is based on the ethical foundations that are promoted from an education based on excellence for all students. For us and in the words of Paulo Freire \"Education needs both technical, scientific and professional training as dreams and utopia\".", "http://www.wejs.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA101-049644_3"]]}}}}
