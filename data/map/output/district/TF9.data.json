Proud to know You!\r\n\r\nOur project focuses on the issues facing young people in our schools and communities who feel they do not belong, for a variety of reasons, in our European society. This can result in bullying, a feeling of isolation, segregation, discrimination, a lowering of self esteem, negative attitudes to learning, low attainment in education and a lack of motivation, to name but a few. Belonging in society through increased understanding would avoid prejudices, fear and stereotypes and would lead to greater tolerance and respect towards our selected focus groups: victims of bullying, families from different cultural and religious backgrounds, refugees, those with physical and mental disabilities and children from disadvantaged families. We believe that early intervention in education can positively affect the lives of children in later life so they can become responsible adults and active, valued members of a global society. This is becoming more and more important in a changing Europe and in a changing world with its religious and territorial conflicts.\r\n\r\nOver the last few years teachers from our schools have noticed an increase in the challenges resulting from social exclusion and have linked it  to low educational attainment. By using the creative arts, our schools will show  participants and stakeholders that young people from different personal, cultural, religious and national backgrounds can live, work and study together in a positive way and can thus overcome all types of prejudices. \r\n\r\nOur project gives practical and creative opportunities to promote a better understanding and respect for those with different abilities. At the end of the project, the students will present what they have experienced and learned to parents and the community. By working together in workshops, young people in our target groups will improve their self esteem, feel valued members of our communities and will see improvements in their educational attainment. This will have long term benefits for the rest of their lives and they will become ambassadors for living an open, free and democratic life. Being part of a multicultural and inclusive society, will show our students the importance of engaging every single person in the project when it comes to acceptance, tolerance and respect.\r\n\r\nWe aim to promote a change in attitudes within our schools and communities so that people see the 'person' and consider the 'differences' as positives. We believe that early intervention is vital for long term positive outcomes. Through better understanding of the causes of social exclusion, we hope to dispel some of the fears sometimes portrayed by the media in the UK and throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe project will also show the benefits of working in partnerships at a European level. It is particularly important for our young people to know that even after Britain has left the EU, strong and positive partnerships with European countries can be successful and that there is so much we can learn from each other.\r\n\r\nBy the end of our project, and beyond, we want to see how a feeling of 'belonging' in a community along with achievement in education can lead to a greater feeling of well-being, happiness and pride.", "http://www.cheswardine.shropshire.sch.uk", "Cheswardine Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036561_coordinator"]]}}, "3DQ": {"nhs": {"data": [["R1D", "Market Drayton Cottage Hospital", "nhs_R1D07"]]}}, "4PA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1204329600000, 1346371200000, "An integrated platform enabling Theranostic applications at the Point of Primary Care", "Lewis Trevor Stanley Medical Device Consultancy", "TheraEDGE is an industry-driven effort to accelerate the adoption of theranostics applications in Primary Care by pushing Point of Care Test (POCT) technology far beyond its current state-of-the-art and by delivering clinical, analytical and operational breakthroughs.TheraEDGE is built around the high-incidence clinical case of early-diagnosing lower respiratory tract infections in Primary Care.

The strategic long-term vision for the partners is to innovate and commercialise low-cost SOFCs for household energy generation, based on patented designs, integrated systems and prototypes developed in other EC, UK and TR projects. We envisage CHP systems will replace household boilers in a transition towards a hydrogen economy, and very early prototypes are already being ordered at very high cost (e.g. Eon and CFCL; http://www.cfcl.com.au/Assets/Files/20111128-JTI_and_E.ON_order.pdf).
