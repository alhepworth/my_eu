The overall objective is to create a pool of specialised wave energy research professionals to support an emerging industry in a field with a very strong anticipated growth and no dedicated existing training curriculum. Although most jobs can be done being a trained engineer in one of the adjacent fields, the existance of interdisciplinary skilled researchers trained in direct connection to the technology development is vital for successful development. In the predecessor, almost all fellows where immediatley absorbed by industrial players in the field or continued research in the host institution. The work plan for WAVETRAIN 2 fellows is specifically directed towards a wide range of challenges that industrial-scale wave energy implementation faces in the present situation, with some bias towards technical issues, from hydrodynamic and PTO (Power-Take-Off) design, to instrumentation issues and energy storage and cost reduction show to be critical for successful deployment. On the other hand, also non-technical \u201cbarriers\u201d, typically less tangible difficulties related to legal issues (licensing, conflicts of use, EIA procedures, grid connection, regional differences) and the non-sufficient representation of socio-economic benefits of the sector, will be dealt with, as they are seen as a major obstacel for fast implementation on a European scale. The methodology to achieve the desired results is to provide (i) in-depth training in one applied research topic (host institution), (ii) good interdisciplinary background and understanding of industry environment (short courses and secondments), and (iii) active participation in wave power plant testing in the sea (some of the profiles; others: site visits). The in-depth training at the host institution will be incorporated in relevant research topics, where typically an advance the state-of-the-art is expected.", 180620.0, 3097593.0, 8, 13, "WAVETRAIN 2", null, "http://www.awsocean.com", null, "fp7_88284_998799689"]]}}}}
