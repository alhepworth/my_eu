We have been developing a widening range of MFL skills and have been involved in a number of activities that have been embraced by the whole school and its community - this has been part of our continuing professional development. Where skills have been developed it is intended through future projects to embed our approach to MFL and head towards becoming a Centre of Excellence. By involvement in the projects thus far we have been impressed by the level of skill seen by children in the schools of our European partners - this is something that we wish to emulate and be at the forefront of over the near and longer term future of the school.\r\n12 members of teaching and support staff are expecting to participate in the activities and all have a range of experience with MFL - all are enthusiastic and keen to further their knowledge and experiences. The cultural activities outlined in the course descriptions and the experience obtained from current involvement (use of IT, sharing resources, sharing good practice etc) will allow us to further develop the impact of MFL within the school.\r\nWe envisage that spontaneous language and the confidence required to deliver MFL successfully and to a higher level that previously considered is one of our goals.

NIHL results in reduced productivity from lost work days, insurance claims and potential early retirement. Current EU legislation requires employers to provide suitable ear protection for workers exposed to high levels of noise, but worker compliance is often low as they perceive the use of hearing protection as impairing hearing capability. Thus a suitable alternative to existing ear protection is needed, allowing speech and alarms to be heard whilst significantly reducing other potentially harmful sound. In summary the PiezoSelEx device will: \u2022 Promote productivity due to easier communication \u2022 Reduce the risk of NIHL \u2022 Contribute to a more comfortable work environment \u2022 Reduce employee absenteeism due to increased wearer comfort and a reduction in NIHL \u2022 Contribute to a safer working environment as warning signals will be easier to hear. The use of piezo materials in this proposal has many advantages over prior art of high end earplugs. The novel use of \u2018piezo pairs\u2019 self-powers the earplug, thus eliminating the need for external electrical equipment as is required by all current piezo earplugs. Furthermore, the use of sets of piezo pairs not only enables the device to cancel out all noise above 75 dB (A), but also \u2018filter\u2019 out background noise except for sound frequencies associated with speech and warning signals. The use of piezo pairs removes the need for batteries, thus having positive environmental implications. Ergonomic and safety testing of the prototype will take place to ensure maximum comfort and safety for users over extended periods of time. There are also a number of wider benefits for Europe.

Now Reception & KS1 have 3 classes,  years 1&2 have 2.5 classes,  year 3 has 3 classes, and  years 4,5 & 6 have 2 classes.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of pupils who come from minority ethnic groups , those who speak English as an additional language and  disadvantaged pupils supported by pupil premium funding, are higher than the national average.  \r\n\r\nOur school has in the past been very much involved in international activities and we have seen the very positive benefits that this can bring. Our previous Comenius Regio project showed us how cooperation between schools in different countries can benefit all. We made positive changes to our school as a result of the project, as did our partner schools.\r\n\r\nLinaker is a global school with a high number of EAL pupils. We are known for good practice in the teaching of English to EAL pupils and wish to mirror this success with the teaching of MFL. Our EAL pupils are particularly receptive to learning new languages and we see languages as a way in which these pupils can shine and achieve success, building their confidence and self-esteem. We need to raise the attainment of our EAL pupils and see this project as being a way of doing this.\r\n\r\nWe have a high proportion of disadvantaged children with a very limited knowledge of the world around them. We need to give them opportunities and experiences to widen their knowledge and understanding of the world and improve their attainment.\r\n\r\nThe greatest strategic need is to move from our current provision involving one member of staff taking responsibility for language teaching across the school without much link to other subjects, to a much more effective model whereby class teachers plan, teach and assess MFL alongside all of the curriculum subjects. This will result in pupils having more exposure to the target language and an increase in attainment. The status of languages will change and it will no longer be considered an add-on subject. It will become part of our whole school thematic approach to teaching.\r\n\r\nThese project objectives are very much in line with our whole school priorities as outlined in our School Development Plan.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the most effective way to meet our schools needs will be through a two-year project which will involve immersion training courses in Spain.\r\n\r\nParticipants will be from both key stages and also from different roles (TA, teacher, SMT) to develop the whole school ethos and approach to language learning.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen courses that include elements of language learning, culture and methodology and also allow participants to take part in professional discussions and spend time visiting a partner school in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe 12 mobilities will be spread evenly across the two years of the project.

It has two educational lines with 5 kindergarten units and 12 Primary Education units, 1 classroom for Integration Support and another for Hearing and Language. The centre is a bilingual centre that participates in a language programme.\r\nHow did the idea of creating a European project come about?\r\nDuring these years, we have been working through the etwinning platform on a joint project with this Southport Centre. The work has been cooperative and we have worked on various objectives, they have guided us and taught us how to carry out and use certain strategies, but we think that this K1 project is the culmination of a work that has been kept at a distance for three years; it is an opportunity to see everything in practice instead of in written form, as in our communications.\r\nIn addition to bilingualism, the attraction for internationalisation in this centre has been continual.\r\nThis plan arises from the need for teachers to be trained in language skills in order to improve the teaching of the language, learn skills, develop strategies for the development of students' oral skills in the classroom and integrate migrant students, and to improve practice in the classroom.\r\nATTENTION TO DIVERSITY\r\nA constant in our school is the integration of the foreign families settled in the area and offering a quality education for their current needs. In fact, we have created links with the educational centres in the countries of origin of these immigrant families (using platforms such as etwinning).\r\nPARTICIPANT PROFILES\r\nThe participants are from the bilingualism team. They are fluent in the foreign language: M\u00f3nica Mu\u00f1oz, the Bilingualism coordinator, teaches English in Primary Education. Nuria Mat\u00edas, teaches English in Early Childhood Education. Two participants are needed to promote internationalisation in all its Primary and Infant Stages, acquiring strategies and skills that will disseminate and be put into practice in the classroom.\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES\r\nRegarding job shadowing activities and teaching period:\r\nStay requested in Southport, England. School \"Linaker Primary School and Children's Centre\", SEE APPENDIXES: attached letter from the Director of the School.\r\nObservation of the teaching of the English language and activities in this language in curricular areas, observation of the introduction of a second language (Spanish) as a foreign language, attention to diversity: protocols to follow, practical classes, interaction with the environment: the Coast, operation and strategies used in Early Childhood Education, how they integrate new technologies in the classroom, transferring it to the classroom, motivating the students to continue the activities.\r\nOthers related to the functioning and curriculum of the strategic partner.\r\nThe conclusions will be passed on to the rest of the teaching staff for improvement, acquisition of new technologies and strategies to form part of our future programming.\r\nOur aim is to continue working with other Centres promoting interculturality and improving the attention to diversity.\r\nCompetencies to be acquired by participants:\r\nLinguistic competence in foreign languages - Competence in new teaching methodologies for teaching diversity learning and inclusive schools - Competence in collaborative work - Digital competence in the internationalisation of the centre through the use of digital platforms for projects in collaboration with other European centres: Etwinning, exchange of good teaching practices - Ability to transmit knowledge and experience. \r\nMETHODOLOGY USED\r\nThe methodology is the practice. Extensive use will be made of evidence-based examples and experiences.\r\nIt is a question of introducing what has been learned into the usual classroom methodology.\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPACT\r\nImpact on our school in the short term based on the objectives of this project in relation to all the learning acquired. It will focus on direct contact with the local teachers and this immersion will provide first-hand statistical data, providing a definitive vision of the culture of the host country and the environmental care of the coastal zone.

The \"True Finns\" in Finland are getting more support mainly in rural areas. The AFD (Alternative for Germany) has managed to be voted into three federal parliaments.

Together with our long-term partnerorganisations from Finland, Poland, Spain and England we want to invite 50 young people to discover, live and change Europe.\r\n\r\nSince 2010 Europe is in ongoing crises. The worldwide difficult economic situation has left significant traces also to Europe. The development of the sovereign debt, particularly in Greece, but also in Portugal, Spain and Ireland, was suddenly in the foreground and the youth unemployment, especially in the southern European countries, increased enormously. Many young people lived suddenly without a perspective of better future. This makes it extremely difficult for young people to develop motivation, new opportunities and skills. Those who anyway have skills in foreign languages and possibility to study, are able to find their way, but many so-called disadvantaged young people feel totally left alone.

We should offer equal opportunities for all young people, regardless to their background, whether they are natives, immigrants or refugees. But instead, since 2010 the population's confidence to European politics has decreased. The nationalistic voices have increased all over Europe. At the latest the refugee crisis in 2015 splits the Member States of the European Union in two. To those who want Europe to be more international and open-minded towards other cultures. And to those; who want to close the borders of Europe - whether of rooted financial or xenophobic considerations.\r\n\r\nEurope is currently having difficulties of taking care for the refugees coming Europe and finding a common solution.

An extended refugee crisis, where Turkey\u00b4s role is to be Europes \"door guard\"? Or what happens with United Kingdom? Is \"Brexit\" really going to put in action? And how is it going to affect Europe? One thing is clear: since the referendum for Brexit the violence against people of foreign origin in the UK has increased. The Nationalist tendencies are rising across Europe. The electoral successes of nationalist, Eurosceptic groups show that clearly. Against these facts it is important to set clear signs of a positive, social and united Europe that is willing to provide mutual assistance with the current problems.\r\n\r\nWith these issues we want to deal together with the young people involved with our proejct and animate Europe for them.
