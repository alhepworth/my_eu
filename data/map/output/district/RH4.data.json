In this new digital economy, immaterial value increasingly determines material value, as consumers are looking for new and enriching \"experiences\". It is widely accepted that there is a profound shortage of coherent entrepreneurship training programmes throughout Europe with even fewer initiatives addressing the needs in sectors like the creative industry sector which has a number of sector-specific characteristics that require special consideration. While there is a broad range of vocational education and training programmes that address the development of creative skills there is no evidence that the essential entrepreneurship training is being integrated into non-business graduate education in any of the EU Member States. Supporting people to develop their creative skills without developing the business acumen is an on-going disconnect in education and training that cannot be allowed to continue.The creative industry sector comprises highly innovative companies and is one of Europe's most dynamic sectors, contributing around 2.6 % to EU GDP, with a high growth potential and providing quality jobs to over 5 million people across EU-27.  Creative businesses often contribute to boosting local economies in decline, contributing to the emergence of new economic activities, creating new and sustainable jobs and enhancing the attractiveness of European regions and cities.  EU cohesion policy has recognised the multifaceted contribution of culture and creativity to its strategic objectives of convergence, competitiveness and employment.For most creative individuals developing a new product or idea, the focus and priority is firmly placed on what it can do; how it can be used; what makes it different. While these are all essential pre-requisite to any future potential business of equal importance are questions like:- who are the management team behind the business?- what is the the business model proposed?- how will intellectual property be protected?- does the product or idea have scalable potential?So while having the right idea might get you half the way to success, it will only get you half the way as core business management skills are also required. While individual capacities like creativity, motivation and powers of persuasion are often considered to be key attributes that drive new business ventures among young graduates marrying those skills to business acumen brings success. Providing bespoke entrepreneurship training that is specifically designed to address issues that are unique and particular to graduates in the creative industry sector can help to harness the potential of this sector as a hotbed for graduate entrepreneurship throughout Europe and provide a sustainable pathway to self-employment, economic independence and social cohesion.It is now widely recognised that creative industries will make a significant contribution in building the post-crisis economic landscape in Europe. The \u201cEuropean Competitiveness Report 2010\u201d, referred to the \u201ctransforming role\u201d of the creative industries for the future of the EU economy. While entrepreneurship curricula are not in themselves innovative or new there is a need to provide bespoke learning resources that address the specific needs of different target groups and the SHADOWS project will develop Europe's first bespoke, targeted entrepreneurship curriculum for graduates embarking on a career in the creative industry sector.", "http://www.creativeexchange.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PT01-KA202-022767_6"], [2017, "Raising awareness of how radicalization happens for greater individual safety and country security", "Creative Exchange UK Limited", 213348.0, 8, 8, "There is a perception that those at risk of radicalisation are vulnerable, poorly educated and disadvantaged young people but research has found that the demographics in relation to religion, age, sex, education and financial backgrounds vary. What has been found is that many become radicalized in response to emotive messages and visuals and through frustration or outrage at perceived injustice or inequality. Potential candidates for recruitment and radicalisation often make themselves known by \u2018liking\u2019 a particular post, donating to a cause, downloading information or even searching a particular topic. Terrorist organisations are experts in 'data mining'; engaging with these sympathisers by developing a relationship; often \u2018love bombing\u2019 the individual with positive and encouraging messages and fostering a sense of belonging and community. Like marketing companies, these organisations will research profiles, identifying age, background and interests then use the information to befriend and manipulate the targeted person. \u201cFor the post-Iraq (post-2003) generation especially, Internet chat rooms are now supplementing and replacing mosques, community centres and coffee shops as venues for recruitment.\u201d\r\n\r\nYouTube is being used effectively by extremist groups who use engaging visuals and hip-hop soundtracks in order to target young people. YouTube statistics show that 300 videos are uploaded per minute which makes it difficult to monitor. Certain uploads are tagged \u201cpromotes terrorism\u201d to notify viewers of inappropriate content but they still get aired.  Facebook has 1.3 billion active accounts and half of its users log on every day.  It is used by extremists as a gateway to websites, to share information and propaganda and to identify and message potential recruits. Twitter provides a vehicle to disseminate information in real time, providing \u2018breaking news\u2019 which can be real of fake, often to gain sympathy or incite violence or hostility. Cyber magazines such as Inspire (Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Penninsula) and Dabig (Islamic State magazine) share skillfully edited information and images printed in English and other languages to reach a wide audience. The brothers responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings made homemade bombs using instructions from Inspire.\r\n\r\nThe media-savvy generation is becoming increasingly addicted to competitive on-line gaming where much of the action takes place in hostile environments. The pro-aggression attitude within the on-line gaming world promotes bullying and harassment as well as contributing to homophobia, racism and misogyny.  Gaming has been identified for many years as a way for organisations to interact with young people. The US Army released the video game \u201dAmerica\u2019s Army\u201d in 2002 in an effort to recruit young people while in 2006 a jihadist website featured a video game titled \u201cQuest for Bush,\u201d in which players battled Americans. In 2012 ISIL adapted the popular video game Grand Theft Auto to enable players to role-play as members of ISIL engaged in combat. The gaming world has the potential not only recruit but train soldiers.  It\u2019s easier to persuade a potential recruit to engage in on-line extremist activities such as cyber attacks and hacking if they do not have to leave home or risk death and it\u2019s more cost effective for the terrorist organisation.\r\n \r\nThese are all issues that front line educators and youth workers are expected to address with their target groups. Young adults need support in any type of education but the vast and ever developing on-line world poses many challenges and potential dangers. HEADS-UP wants to build the skills of front liners through in-service training and a series of simulated videos that explicitly demonstrate those on-line threats. This practical, user friendly set of resources will enable educators to support their target groups more effectively by teaching them how to identify and deal with potential radicalization and grooming threats.", "http://www.creativeexchange.org", "Creative Exchange UK Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA204-036685_coordinator"], [2018, "Using Performing Arts for Building Key Competences of Marginalised Adults", "Creative Exchange UK Limited", 200084.0, 7, 7, "European societies are prosperous and affluent places to live offering high levels of social protection and ranking highly in terms of wellbeing, human development and quality of life. The EU is in full recovery mode experiencing strong growth and the lowest levels of unemployment since 2009. Despite this there are many Europeans who are still concerned for future generations with growing threats and uncertainties both at home and abroad; increasing inequalities and a growing gap between the haves and the have-nots; a resurgence of racism and xenophobia; and the viral spreading of misinformation and fake news. Building common values into all learning environments can help mitigate intolerance, polarisation and divisive nationalism.\r\n\r\nIf education is to play any role in the life of the hardest to reach adults who are furthest away from mainstream provision or for the growing communities of recently arrived migrants throughout Europe, the design and delivery of the educational process needs to be completely rethought. Within the education sector as a whole, adult education is regarded as the poor relation where the provision of high quality in-service training for the continuous professional development of staff is concerned. Within the adult education sector itself, there are further disparities with fewer training supports provided for those educators working in informal community based adult education programmes than exists for those in more formal adult education environments. \r\n\r\nThe Artistic Licence consortium believes that the first step in redefining an education service that is capable of engaging those furthest from provision is the design and implementation of bespoke in-service training for an elite team of adult educators and resourcing them with a full complement of bespoke educational materials that can help overcome multi-faceted learning difficulties. Educators are the key enablers to support disengaged adults and members of migrant communities on an educational journey to the highly valued key competences that are essential for social inclusion and personal fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThe Artistic Licence project will produce the following intellectual outputs to support its objectives:\r\n1) A tool-kit of resources to build basic skills and competences that are based around the different performing arts disciplines\r\n2) A train-the-trainer course for adult educators to enable them harness the potential of the performing arts for building basic skills and key competences\r\n3) A bespoke online learning environment to support mobile learning\r\n4) A thought provoking policy paper that looks at the role of alternative educational approaches in addressing the needs of marginalised adults\r\n\r\nThe Commission Communication on \u201cStrengthening European Identity through Education and Culture\u201d calls for investing in people and their education and to make sure that education and training systems help all learners acquire the knowledge, skills and competences that are deemed essential in today\u2019s world.

One of the main recommendations (Action Pillars) by the EU Commission Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan (2012) is to promote entrepreneurial education and training, however, the uptake and the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education in Europe are still far from being fully satisfactory. This is mainly due to lack of suitable materials and lack of skills in trainers.Storytelling is a very effective methodology because it brings together the rational and the emotional, and elicits identification andemulation in the listener.
