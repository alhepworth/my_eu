It aims to increase the performance of a sector that, over the past two decades, upheld three main strategies to handle global competitive pressure: cost-oriented, product/service-oriented and productivity-oriented. TCBL provides a business experimentation framework for exploring variations on such strategies. The framework will be supported by Knowledge Spaces as a generative force and Business Services as an enabling force. A network of Business Labs will be set up, based on three key variations: Design Labs (e.g. creating emotionally-oriented immaterial value), Making Labs (e.g. converting skilled labour into material value), and Place Labs (e.g. generating spatial community- and socially- oriented value). Each of these Labs will explore the issues of cost, product/service and productivity enhancement in a transversal manner and from cross-disciplinary perspectives - including economic, anthropological, and engineering approaches as well as new business values such as environmental and social responsibility, sharing economy, social enterprising, customer-driven small series production (the focus of this call) and emergent or disruptive technologies. With these tools, and supported by an open Associates Programme, TCBL will carry out real-life experimentation and market deployment of a number of Supply Chain, Localisation, Business, Skill Management and Policy innovations involving no fewer than 160 workshops, laboratories and manufacturing plants at EU level with at least 15,000 T&C workers involved.

Nevertheless, the renewal of the sector\u2019s human resources is becoming a serious problem, due to the lack of a labour force with the appropriate skill sets, a structural factor that limits the potential for innovation, productivity improvement and ultimately the competitiveness of the sector.\r\nThe EDU4TEX project intends to support the development of a more attractive and competitive industry, based on young people who are properly informed, trained and motivated to work in an sector that is no longer perceived as a traditional industry that only offers repetitive, menial  and demotivating tasks.\r\nThe project will evolve into a chain of activities geared towards mobilising young students, their educators, tutors and schools, explaining the relevance of a career in the industry, (mainly in textile & clothing industry). This will be achieved by establishing a programme of practical, scientific, technical and technological training activities and creating new, didactic contents related to a wide range of textile & clothing operations to provide a new insight into how the sector works, and the opportunities it offers.\r\nThe project will raise awareness and familiarise young people with the markets, materials, equipment, and standards operating across the sector as they relate to a wide range of occupations, illustrating the range of career opportunities available and facilitating the choice of potential vocational  and professional career paths supported by structured information, advice and guidance.\r\nThe result of this project will valorise the school community role supporting important decisions relating to students\u2019 career choices, increasing the awareness of the opportunities that exist across the sector and motivating young Europeans to embrace new emerging careers in growing, competitive companies. EDU4TEX will address two specific audiences:\r\n- Career advisors, teachers and schools: We will develop high quality pedagogical content to help teachers and career advisors, providing information to assist in the guidance of young students to the orientation in vocational processes;\r\n- Young students:  High quality pedagogical and practical training contents to encourage young students in the choice of a future career in the textile and clothing industry.\r\nThe consortium established is represented by 9 partners from 5 European countries, namely United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Austria and Italy, and will unite key players with the necessary expertise to fulfill the project objectives, creating an innovative relationship between the sector and schools, creating European dimension with their complementary backgrounds, expertise and capabilities.

With almost 850 000 companies, 5 million jobs, and another 3 million jobs to be found throughout the supply chain, the Fashion industry can contribute to further economic growth and a strengthening of the competitive position of the EU economy as a whole.\r\nDue to pressures for change resulting notably from trade liberalization and increasing external competition, consumer developments, technological advances, changes in production costs and environmental issues, the fashion industries are characterized  by continuing restructuring and modernization. \r\nThis change indeed requires a more qualified workforce to deal with new technologies, stimulate innovation, ensure quality management and develop international strategies and marketing. Therefore, the availability of adequately skilled workers has become one of the major issues for the fashion industries. Fashion industries faced the shortage of trained and qualified personnel for their export and fashion marketing departments. \r\nRecognizing their critical role, recent European efforts, such as the European Skills Council of Textile Clothing Leather & Footwear and the European Fashion Industries Alliance, have come together in order to strengthen the comparative advantages of the fashion industries which include, among others, the well-educated and high-skilled professional workforce of the industry. Other factors include the rapid advance of digital technologies, the globalisation of networks and the deregulation of media. \r\nEmployees from the fashion industries, students and SME\u2019s, who would like to succeed, have to adapt to globalised market and ICT-based vocational education and training. Therefore a precise and effective ICT training tool for development, enhancement and boost of their transversal skills, is inevitably demanding.\r\nFashion industries also need a flexible workforce that can respond to the development and the globalized market and the trend and need for internationalization. The workforce needs to be well qualified and ready to face the increased competition and rapid technological changes. To be compete in the global market fashion industries have to be smarter and able to adapt to changes. To achieve this, fashion industries need new education and training systems and tools for their existing and potential workforce in order to respond to the demands of the labour market and the global competition. In a framework of global competition, innovation and development are crucial elements to provide fresh impetus to a sustainable and competitive industry.\r\nIn this context, the proposed project aims to design and develop an innovative and comprehensive training protocol for export personnel of fashion industries, using ICT-based learning approaches and methodologies that will offer essential transversal skills for enabling them be ready to respond to international trade and market demands and enhancing the extroversion and the competitiveness of the industry as a whole. Bringing together the different sectors of fashion industries, the proposed protocol will follow a comprehensive learner-centered approach and will be coupled with an integrated certification framework, based on acquired knowledge, skills and competences, in line with the European Qualification Framework (EQF). \r\nThe objective of the proposed project is the design and implementation of an innovative and comprehensive training protocol. Work-based training ICT tools in fashion industries are generally very outdated. They exist, but their availability is often not sufficient, the content is out-of-date and its distribution is not organised satisfactorily. Majority of present information materials regarding exports and global market information are at disposal only in paper form and most of them don\u2019t cover modern trends, materials and fashion. Therefore, such a professional tool is considered extremely useful, since it helps to enhance the international extroversion of the sector especially for SME\u2019s. The platform will focus on online training and will facilitate dissemination of knowledge and sharing of experience. Moreover, it will serve as a medium for all stakeholders in the field to share concerns and advice, as well as promote employment opportunities.\r\nThe platform will respond to fashion marketing skills and for that scope will concentrate information and data regarding third countries market mechanisms and their function market\u2019s technical requirements, recent trends of fashion marketing and expo\u2019s evaluation in the global market, market\u2019s development, development of the demand of sector\u2019 s products, consumer\u2019s behaviors and habits, trend analysis, demand chain, mechanisms for directs distribution of a product to international markets (by identifying customers;meeting their needs; implementing sales plans).", "http://www.textilehouse.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-EL01-KA202-013907_2"]]}}, "2RR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "YOU-th & HEAL-th", "Huddersfield Pakistani Community Alliance", 25160.0, 8, 8, "\"HPCA\"  together with its partner organisations initiates a project \u201cYOU-th & HEAL-th\" with participants involved both in youth field, healthy life and conscious lifestyle.\r\n\r\nWe came up with the idea to implement this project during the Flash workshop.

Young people will learn all the crops growing process: from planting to collecting fruits. Though it is long procedure and short period of time is not always enough, germinating would be the perfect solution in this case. We also see this project as to be continuous. Participants will also be asked to bring different seeds and later on we will mix them all together and each of them will bring some of the various seeds home, plant and will have a beautiful outcome of the project: grown plants from the \u201cYOU-th & HEAL-th\" on their windowsill or in the garden. \r\n2. Participants will be able to understand the differences of various eating habits and to consciously choose which one is the best for them. As most of the organisations have different experience, we are sure that participants will be able to gain very important knowledge about foods and will be motivated to interest even at home about this kind of topic.\r\n\r\n3. Youngsters will understand what is the consumerism culture and how it damages our world and will be able to make conscious decisions towards buying. Though the results of it almost never seen in the home country, the world is one big family therefore we really need to start to care about others. I.e. cheap clothing has a real cost and it is not fair that anybody sit 12 hours sewing and sewing until they collapse of dehydration and hunger. Most of the youngsters are not aware of this situation therefore we see how out partners from Netherlands can share their knowledge with other participants.\r\n\r\n4. Participants will learn how to survive in the nature. As we will go for the camping, it will be the priceless experience and challenge for them. We will also learn how to collect berries, mushrooms, various herbs which are very important for the health and it does not requires finances but only work.\r\n\r\nWe do expect that partners will establish new partnerships and will develop concrete projects within Erasmus + programme, using conscious lifestyle as a core.
