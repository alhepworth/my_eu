The diseases of particular focus for this project are osteochondrosis  (OC), insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) and chronic progressive lymphedema (CPL). The occurrence of these diseases is a significant problem for horse owners and breeders and leads to poor animal welfare and severe economic losses. The initiative of this project is mainly based on the strong wish from the studbooks to obtain a genetic alternative to the more traditional breeding methods which are often not feasible in the smaller breeds. For each disease, a genetic component to disease susceptibility has been confirmed and several research groups in Europe have independently carried out small to medium-sized studies in order to find the causative genetic mechanisms underlying the disorder. However, the mode of inheritance for these diseases appears to be complex, and no genes or mutations have been identified yet, suggesting that analysis of much larger sample sizes is required or across datasets. This project aims to bring together the efforts of European research groups that are currently working on the genetics of disease susceptibility in horses. This collaboration will enable the groups to pool data for meta-analysis leading to more rapid progress in the identification of the genes and suitable gene markers for use in genomic selection against disease susceptibility.

And whilst previously uneconomical deep-water oilfields are now becoming financially viable, accessing them remains difficult due to the technical challenges associated with extreme operating conditions.\n\nWhen working in water at depths of up to 5000m the water pressure is above 500atm. Components and systems for extracting oil and gas need to be neutrally buoyant, in order to maintain them in the desired position. Buoyancy modules for drill risers used in exploration lines are currently made from syntactic foams using micro and macro-spheres. Macro-spheres offer buoyancy advantages, but become increasingly unreliable at greater depths due to manufacturing inconsistencies. A typical deep-water buoyancy module will contain thousands of tightly packed spheres, and when a buoyancy module fails this can necessitate costly repairs and lead to environmental harm\n\nThe current technology for buoyancy modules operating at less than 3km uses spheres made of Expanded PolyStyrene (EPS) balls which are then coated with a shell of epoxy resin. The epoxy coating acts as the load bearing structure withstanding water pressure. Spheres from each batch are pressure tested and rated for performance which determines the depth at which the batch can be used\n\nThis proposal concerns development of a perfectly spherical, low-cost coated ceramic macrosphere manufacturing process.
