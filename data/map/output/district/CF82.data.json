An unsuccessful vocational orientation due to a lack of competence of the involved people is i.a. a reason for an increased number of training abortions. Because of that the risk of future youth unemployment and social exclusion for young people in Europe will grow. The basis for a high-quality vocational orientation, that gains in importance because of the increasing cross-border education and training market mobility for both potential trainees, as well as the companies, is an EU-wide, on quality standards basing qualification of the vocational orientation measures implementing staff (e.g. teachers, professionals of youth work , trainers, career counselors). The need to develop a specific European qualification for voactiona orientation results from the following reasons: 1. In addition to numerous different measures with cooperating companies, an inadequate integration of vocational orientation e.g. in the school education and various consulting offers of different institutions, the implementation methods and priorities of vocational orientation in the EU are very versatile, non-transparent and non-uniform. That is attributable to a different degree of implementation of the vocational orientation in Europe and a different qualifications of the specialist staff. 2. Especially the industrial, technical and handicrafts fields with its diverse training opportunities offers young people with a low/middle school leaving certificate and disadvantaged young people numerous job opportunities.  3. The specialised staff (i.a. in schools, institutions of independent youth work, education providers, chambers, consulting intuitions, job agencies) has often only informally acquired professional / methodological knowledge and there is also often a lack regarding to the knowledge of the specific requirements of the workplace and the special job requirements. 4. Companies complain an inadequate professional monitoring and counseling for young people in the process of career choice, because the requirements of the working world are not known.The development of the above-mentioned EU qualification concept and the supplementary VET products contributes on one hand to a professionalization of the actors, who are doing vocational orientation measures/guidance. On the other hand young people will be accompanied and advised in a better quality in their process of career choice, with the result that the next generation of skilled worker is sustainable ensured for companies. To make the EU-concept transferable in all countries and regionsand  cross-border comparable, we also develop quality standards for the concept to ensure the quality. Furthermore, a good practice guideline for the implementation of vocational orientation measures/activities will be developed that supports the practical implementation through the preparation of unknown measures/ activities/models/teaching materials for the actors and making them accessible. In addition, an assessment instrument will be developed that allows companies to identify whether potential trainees are suitable for the selected training program/profession and if they have gone through a good vocational orientation. So for companies should be ensured that the trainees don\u2019t cancel the training due to lack of professional ideas and aptitute. Furthermore against the background of a sustainable implementation of the products should be developed a guideline for implementing  in the EU-level as well as a webplattform to download all the products and further information that support the work of the actors. Against the background of the project aim of the sustainable implementation of the developed products in the EU should be also developed guideline for implementation (i.a. to integrate all in the education of teachers) as well as a website to download all the products and of further information to support the work of the actors.The development of the different products is based on a VET scientific analysis (actual/ target analysis, case studies, expert interviews) in all participating countries on the current status of vocational orientation, the level of implementation in schools, universities and career consulting firms, training companies (initiatives, measures, programs, curricula, etc.) and the requirements of all stakeholders to a vocational orientation.With the support of the developed Products should be initiated a professional future orientation support process, which enables young people to establish their own career choice competence.
