However, when examining historical processes, almost all communities separate women and men within society. This includes gender roles, and gender specific work and jobs regarded as suitable. Especially in our country, gender perception is affects the participation of woman in the work force negatively. Because of this female employment is less than the male. Thus, in 2013 statistical data of the employment rate of woman is 27.1%. In european countries, The average rate of employment 58.8%.. This project will actualise in Ankara, with 36 participants from 16 different countries between 21.08.2016 and 31.08.2016 . This project is about basic gender equality in women's labor force and it will run over 9 days. During the project, specialists, trainers, and facilitators, responsible for non-formal education methods, and responding to the expected outcomes of the project with different needs, such as: workshops, brainstorming, group work, outdoor activities, drama, simulations, roundtables, written and verbal feedback, will be used. In our project, taking into account the profile of participants, fun ice-breakers, actuators and team work, which aims to contribute to prepared group dynamics and intercultural learning prepared, will be done. Theoretical knowledge will be taught by experienced professionals who have more knowledge. But these are studies in active involvement and interaction in the form of activities, rather than academical studies. During the Project, except from the theoretical sessions, all sessions will be managed by 3 instructors and 2 facilitator, all of whom have experience in the field, the non-formal learning methods, and hold experience of intercultural learning. The aim of the training course is to: Develop cooperation and entrepreneurship for disadvantaged groups in the labor force, Female unemployment holds an important place in disadvantaged groups, and to better understand young persons we must analyse the issue and provide active solutions at both a national and international level. Comprehensive international cooperation will allow the introduction of innovative and creative ideas. Expected result within the project activities are To create awareness of entrepreneurship within young people and allow them to gain new perspectives on the subject. Existing studies on women's emolument and effectiveness within civil society  and the number of youths in the field of entrepreneurship will increased. . Employment and experience sharing between the different actors working with youth workers in the field of entrepreneurship, promote dialogue and cooperation will provide better design and execution of future projects. \u2022 Implemented in the European Employment Strategy and on the general state of Gender Equality in Employment Policy, the level of knowledge of young people and youth workers will be increased. \u2022 Women's participation in the labor force and employment will increase, and new approaches to the problems will be identified in line with the findings, obtained by examining the best practice. By ensuring they have been successful, workable solutions will be presented. \u2022 Mentality, traditional structures, and other obstacles restricting the participation of women in the economic and social spheres will be identified, and will be worked upon in order to reduce social consciousness.", "http://women'splatformUK@facebook.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-TR01-KA105-029150_5"]]}}, "8TB": {"life": {"data": [[2012, "LIFE Little Terns - Improving the conservation status of the little tern in the UK through targeted action at the most important colonies", "Royal Society for the Protection of Birds", 2668804.0, 1334402.0, "The decline in the population of the little tern (<i>Sterna albifrons</i>) in the UK since the 1990s is a cause for concern. The principal threat to this shore nesting species is from human disturbance. After a decline between the 1930s and 1960s, the population recovered through protection and surveillance by wardens of breeding sites. However, in recent years the population has fallen again due to a range of factors, including disturbance, predation, habitat change and high tides linked to summer storms. There has been a reduction in the number of colonies, a loss of range in the west of the UK and, in general, there are poor levels of productivity. Sea-level rise also poses a threat to a number of current colonies. The total UK population is estimated to be less than 2 000 breeding pairs. The project will be the first nationally co-ordinated programme of action for the species, working with 29 colonies (about 65% of the total population) in 15 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) of the Natura 2000 network.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=4755", "http://www.littleternproject.org.uk/,", "life_92"], [1999, "Living with the sea  - Living with the sea : Managing Natura 2000 sites on dynamic coastlines", "English Nature", 1814120.0, 907061.0, "There\u2019s no denying that the coastline along the eastern shores of the UK is gradually eroding away under the relentless pressure of rising sea levels.  Stories abound of houses literally dropping into the sea and local beauty spots disappearing under the waves. In the early days valiant attempts were made to combat this problem head-on: blockades and artificial barriers were put up to prevent the sea from making further incursions inland. But, as it turned out, this just shifted the problem elsewhere. It had to be recognised that the forces driving coastal change are so powerful that it is not sustainable to resist them. \n\nSo now the policy is one of \u2018managed retreat\u2019. This, however, has several implications for Natura 2000 sites, many of which are located along the English coastline.  Ensuring that the overall ecological requirements of the Natura 2000 sites are maintained in the long term requires that losses are made good by gains elsewhere, for instance, through the re-creation of areas with similar habitats. \n\nThis LIFE project developed a strategic approach to integrating the management of flood risk with the ecological needs of Natura 2000.  This would enable the UK Government to meet the obligations of Article 6(2) of the Habitats Directive - namely to avoid deterioration of natural habitats and the habitats of species - even at the cost of losing individual sites. \nThe project was a collaborative effort between two public bodies: English Nature and the Environment Agency, operating under the guidance of an advisory group comprising nine other organisations including the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association and several conservation organisations.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=346", "http://www.english-nature.org.uk/livingwiththesea ,", "life_199"]]}}}}
