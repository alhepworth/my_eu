It will also implement training sessions with 50,000 boys and girls with fewer opportunities, migrants, and refugees, taking part in on-going sport programmes of 20 locations across Europe. The toolkit will be freely accessible and its distribution will take place online, on paper and in practice.

Over the course of two years, the toolkit will be researched, developed and tested to ensure it serves as a valuable guide for trainers and youth workers throughout Europe, opening spaces for youth with fewer opportunities to compete in the labour market as trained professionals with sustainable life-skills. Furthermore, the toolkit allows youth organisations, schools and vocational training centres to increase the attractiveness of and commitment to their programmes.

Experience and research show that the more an organisation is\r\n    led and owned by the people of the target group, the more they deliver services that increase the quality of life of the users. \r\n-  The transformation from charities and foundations into social enterprises: Public or private services providing organisations\r\n    gradually became aware that they need to adopt a more business-like approach, that they are urged to use management methods\r\n    and management skills to realise their mission, to increase the efficiency of their activities and to guarantee their sustainability.  \r\nIn view of both paradigm shifts the disabled users of social services are challenged \r\n- To take up their unique and irreplaceable role and task within these service providing organisations.\r\n   Because most of the disabled users are not used and not trained to take full responsibility for the organisation, provision and\r\n   control of their care and support services, they need to be trained and empowered to fill in this new role and responsibility. \r\n- To think and act as social entrepreneurs. Most disabled users are not sufficiently familiar with modern strategies and methods to\r\n   run and manage services providing organisation. That is why they need to be educated and trained to transform their\r\n   organisations into social enterprises, to make use of business approaches and business solutions to tackle both social issues and\r\n   personal needs. \r\nPROJECT AIMS AND OBJECTIVES \r\nThe final aim of all the processes, procedures and activities of the project is to enable disabled users of care and support services all over Europe to play a key role in the organisation, provision and management of their social services and to become in that way co-producers of these social services. \r\nTo this end, the project consortium intends \r\n-  To introduce and disseminate the concept and practice of user-driven social enterprises at local, national and European level;\r\n-  To bring together and to exchange know-how and experience about \u2018user-driven organisations\u2019 and \u2018social enterprises\u2019  for people\r\n    with disabilities from different members states of the EU;\r\n-  To improve the entrepreneurial skills and competences of disabled users who want to become co-producers of their care and\r\n    support services;\r\n-  To provide them in that way with increased opportunities on the public and private labour market and a more active participation\r\n    in society.    \r\nPROJECT CONSORTIUM\r\nThe project consortium was based on positive cooperation experience during previous partnerships projects  and pursues a balance between educational institutions and services providing NGO\u2019s and a correct representation of different European regions. ADO Icarus (Belgium) acts as the project coordinator, the University of Valencia (Spain) and the Spoleczna Akademia Nauk from Lodz (Poland) are the educational partners in the consortium, and the Disability Resouce Centre from Birmingham (UK), The Spinal Cord Paralytics Association from Istanbul (Turkey) and the Social Centre Burgas from Burgas (Bulgaria) participate in the project as non for profit organisations of and for disabled people.  \r\nPROJECT RESULTS AND OUTPUTS\r\nThe project will provide all relevantstakeholders in the social field with a broad range of elaborated and practical tools and methods to make the transition to user-driven social enterprises. To realise the aims and objectives of the project the project consortium will develop, try out and disseminate  innovative and high quality methods and instruments for the vocational education and training of disabled people.  The main intellectual outputs of the project will therefore consist of\r\n- Three specific training packages on disability,  individual capacity building and organisational capacity building;\r\n- A project manual \r\n- A online learning platform\r\nThe intellectual outputs of the project will be made available in an electronic and printed way for all actors in the social and educational field on a local, regional, national and international level. \r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\nThe educational materials will be the outputs of three training sessions, two open seminars and a closing conference.

Can we develop new ways to teach history, to connect more with young people\u2019s lives, and help them understand complex current realities? How can we also address the needs of different learners, and integrate learners from different cultural backgrounds? How can we build greater trust and understanding between communities \u2013 both within the school environment, and beyond?\u2019 \r\n\r\nThe project will focus on the experiences of migrant communities in different countries in the past. What happened to these communities? What traces remain of them today? What kind of traditions and heritage did they bring with them? How far have these traditions survived? It will provide a model for a different way of teaching history in schools, based in Narrative Inquiry. This is a groundbreaking approach which has been developed by Midland Actors Theatre for use in schools. It places an emphasis on individual stories and experiences, as a way of exploring wider trends and developments in history (for example, the story of a particular individual or family in the past, in migrating to a new country). \r\n\r\nThe project will bring different communities and groups together, to foster integration, and build greater understanding between communities. Project participants will examine historical patterns of migration in Europe, as a way of helping them to understand, and develop a broader perspective on complex current realities. The Project Adviser is the noted historian, Professor Carl Chinn.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop new teaching methods and strategies, to foster the integration of students from different cultural backgrounds, and with different language needs, and to build basic skills. \r\n\r\nThe project will combine Narrative Inquiry with Digital Storytelling (DST), which brings together the tradition of oral and personal narrative with contemporary digital tools. DST develops digital, transversal and basic skills. \r\n\r\nThe project will bring together a range of education providers: two arts-in-education organizations (Midland Actors Theatre, Strawberry Words); a UK secondary school (George Dixon Academy); a secondary school in Turkey (Mehmet Akif Ersoy Ortaokulu); primary schools in Portugal and Italy (Projeto Schol\u00e9, Istituto Comprensivo via Ferraironi); a university in Poland (Collegium Baltica); and an educational digital technology company (Melting Pro). Partners will plan schemes of work together, which they will then deliver in their own classrooms. A total of some 280 students will take part, in different countries. The project will target young people from refugee and migrant groups, who may be experiencing challenges and barriers to integration, and other disadvantaged groups.  \r\n\r\nA filmed record of the project will be made; it will be edited and issued as a dvd, and project videos will also be posted online. The films will show planning meetings, interviews with participants, and project delivery in classrooms in different countries. We will also produce a Teaching Guide, with schemes of work and teaching resources, and also an online Digital Storytelling Toolkit, so that other teachers can use the project in their own classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe project will have a wider legacy. It will be rolled out and embedded as a teaching programme in a number of schools in partner countries; and it will also be incorporated in teacher training courses. \r\n\r\nWe will raise awareness of the project through national and international networks, We believe that it will have an impact on the development of educational policies in partner countries, and on curriculum development, in its development of new ways to address diverse needs in the classroom; as an innovative model of learner-centred and enquiry-based education.", "http://www.georgedixonacademy.com", "Midland Actors Theatre", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036830_3"]]}}}}
