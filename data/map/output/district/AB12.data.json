'Eco' is a much over used prefix, as are the terms 'reusing' and 'recycling' but these are often misunderstood.  The project will use as its fundamental principle the prefix 'R\u20ac' to create activities beyond simplistic recycling. National and cultural idenities blur on many of the digital forums and many students dismiss or ignore the familiar in their search for the trans-world teen culture. To be responsible citizens students need to start by R\u20acappraising their own environment and culture then R\u20acdiscovering the heritage and principles that these are built on before sharing this with their colleagues and creating collaborative work. The students are the driving force of any project and their enthusiasm and imagination will take the project in many and diverse ways. To have responsible European Citizens does not happen in a vacuum and this project will expose all the students and staff to a large variety of other cultures to support their transition in to the global environment beyond the boundaries of their educational establishments.\r\nResponsibility starts at the very local level of our own immediate environment and the need to be aware of making maximum use of resources.  Many of us only think of used materials from food and beverages as the basis for R\u20acuse but within each country the local environments show the ingenuity of our ancestors at R\u20acinventing and R\u20acjuvenating existing buildings or structure which has carried onto the present day i.e. churches converted to flats and restaurants. This project will look at how these R\u20ac projects have occurred and the entrepreneurial companies and individuals who have been responsible and the skill sets required to be involved in this type of activities whether in the work place or the voluntary sector.  The range of partners spans institutions from the general secondary education through to colleges preparing students for the world of work and all will bring and share their skills and use literacy and numeracy to present their findings.

For the European Union as a whole this means improved employment opportunities and economic growth.\n\nThe importance of advanced ICT to the competitiveness of both large and small companies in the engineering and manufacturing domain is well established. Despite early successes in this area, there are still many barriers to the uptake of such solutions, not least of which are the initial cost and complexity of adoption, particularly in the context of challenging trading conditions. This proposal targets the ICT Innovation for Manufacturing SMEs (I4MS) action line (Phase 2) and builds on Phase 1 of that initiative.\n\nPhase 2 addresses the adoption of next generation ICT advances in the manufacturing domain. At the core of Fortissimo 2 are three tranches of Application Experiments (~35 in total). An initial set is included in this proposal and two further sets will be obtained through Open Calls for proposals. These experiments will be driven by the requirements of first-time users (predominately SMEs) and will bring together actors from across the value chain, from cycle providers to domain experts via the Fortissimo Marketplace. This will enable innovative solutions to manufacturing challenges, leading to new and improved design processes, products and services. A key feature of Fortissimo 2 will be the adaption of the Marketplace to meet the needs of end-users.

This is not just a one-off project, it will have a continuing influence for dynamic change and development in learning and teaching. \r\n\r\nThe project has developed out of an initial identified need for schools to adopt new learning strategies and innovative ways to prepare pupils for life, study and work, relevant to the rapid changes of the 21st century. \r\nWe need to respond to the immediate challenge of improving and bringing more relevance to the early years and primary learning experience.  \r\n\r\nThe project outcomes will make a significant contribution to the competences and resources available to teachers and the wider school communities. We will increase and build on the international experience for two of the partners following a previous Comenius project and bring in other schools new to international partnerships.\r\n\r\nAll the partners are very enthusiastic and committed to working together and each school is keen to contribute to all the project activities and take a leading role in specific parts of the work programme. \r\n\r\nThe partnership of six schools will be led by Kirkhill Nursery and Primary School, Aberdeen, which has experience of two previous international partnerships under Comenius. Manstad skole has worked closely with Kirkhill in their previous Comenius partnership, and will learn by taking a strategic supporting role in project organisation and management. All the partners have been chosen to bring specific recognised strengths to the partnership and to provide the necessary base of experience and expertise. \r\n\r\nInternationally recognised external experts are involved and have a role from the outset of the project.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory work has begun, communications regularly taking place, a programme of electronic seminars in May to prepare for a professional, trouble-free approach to project activities. Finer detailed planning is underway. \r\n\r\nThree groups of skills will be the focus of our investigations - Basic, Transversal, Global.
