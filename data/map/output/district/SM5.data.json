Most of them have never left this French Indian Ocean island and still live in the neighbourhood where they were born. The education level and social, intercultural skills are low. The project \u2018EMANCIPER EMPOWER Mayotte by the European mobility in VET\u2019 addresses an urgent and crucial need on the Mayotte territory: develop the employability of young people by encouraging the mobility of 22 participants who will work as a trainee in an enterprise based in London (UK) during 6 months. This mobility will allow them to enhance their professional skills by acquiring transferable skills that are relevant to their profession and other key skills (English language, social and intercultural skills). EMANCIPER targets Vocational Education Training (VET) students of DAESA training centre, the coordinating organisation. Around 4 500 VET and high Education students from Mayotte go in metropolis for studying. The school dropout of students who don\u2019t validate a training or diploma is very high (80%). Therefore, DAESA\u2019s team brings a very solid support to the learners all along the project (before, during and after the mobility) and organize a mobility training before the departure (logistics, language, intercultural learning). The 22 participants will be spread out in 3 groups over the duration of the project (24 months). ZI consultancy, the intermediary organization will act as the focal point at the local level during the mobility and the entry point with the host enterprises. The project impact is to develop young mobility in Mayotte and the number of EU applications. Indeed, DAESA is the only organization which has submitted an ERASMUS+ application. DAESA wishes to become an active and substantial actor in the international and European mobility for VET students. DAESA would like to create a platform giving support to project leaders for facilitating the submission of EU funding applications. Recently, Mayotte became an EU\u2019s outermost regions. For most of the citizens, the European idea is very abstract and unclear. EMANCIPER allows them to raise their curiosity towards EU citizenship and opportunities.

By employing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to liquefy and store cryogens, CryoHub will balance the power grid, while meeting the cooling demand of a refrigerated food warehouse and recovering the waste heat from its equipment and components.\nThe intermittent supply is a major obstacle to the RES power market. In reality, RES are fickle forces, prone to over-producing when demand is low and failing to meet requirements when demand peaks. Europe is about to generate 20% of its required energy from RES by 2020, so that the proper RES integration poses continent-wide challenges.\nThe Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES), and particularly the Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), is a promising technology enabling on-site storage of RES energy during periods of high generation and its use at peak grid demand. Thus, CES acts as Grid Energy Storage (GES), where cryogen is boiled to drive a turbine and to restore electricity to the grid. To date, CES applications have been rather limited by the poor round trip efficiency (ratio between energies spent for and retrieved from energy storage) due to unrecovered energy losses.\nThe CryoHub project is therefore designed to maximise the CES efficiency by recovering energy from cooling and heating in a perfect RES-driven cycle of cryogen liquefaction, storage, distribution and efficient use. Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen food commodities are large electricity consumers, possess powerful installed capacities for cooling and heating and waste substantial amounts of heat. Such facilities provide the ideal industrial environment to advance and demonstrate the LAES benefits.\nCryoHub will thus resolve most of the above-mentioned problems at one go, thereby paving the way for broader market prospects for CES-based technologies across Europe.", 88420.0, 7186916.0, 5, 15, "CryoHub", null, null, null, "h2020_199618_940423052"]]}}, "4BD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "No Walls", "Arrow of Wind", 36656.0, 9, 9, "Soon after the 25th anniversary of the Berlin Wall 60 young people aged 16+ from Germany, England, Ukraine, Macedonia, Italy, Romania, Russia, Spain and Slovakia will meet in Berlin to reflect the impact of this event on the development of Europe and on its subsequent integration.\r\nThe project \"No Walls!\" purposes to investigate the reasons (social, political, economic, ethnic, geographical, historical, etc.) leading to the (regional) separation in different countries.

Both the example of the reunified Germany, as well as of the referendum in Scotland should teach the young people to find a real possible alternative to separation, taking into account the current political/economic situation.
