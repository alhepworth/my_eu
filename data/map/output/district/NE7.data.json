Medication errors often lead to adverse drug reactions, lengthened hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and in the most severe cases, increased mortality. Medication errors pose a significant risk to the European population. It is estimated that 4,7 million Europeans are harmed by a medication error every year, which amounts to preventable healthcare costs in excess of \u20ac11 billion a year. Strikingly, around 50% of medication errors can be stopped at the patient\u2019s bedside. MedEye is an innovative medication verification suite that scans, detects and verifies medication at the bedside. MedEye stops medication errors from taking place by verifying medication before it is administered to patients. MedEye has already been tested and validated in three Dutch hospitals with excellent results. In this project, activities will be performed to push MedEye onto the European market and facilitate its deployment on a large scale. MedEye will be integrated with IT systems that serve a major part of European medical centers. Developments will also be performed to enable the sale, deployment and support of MedEye through distributors. Two launching pilots will be performed to establish transnational proof of performance and cost-effectiveness, which will be instrumental in penetrating the European markets. Given the diversity of the European healthcare landscape, a thorough market research will be performed to gear the commercialization strategy towards individual countries. Together, the activities in this project will provide access to the main EU market and facilitate a wide deployment of MedEye throughout Europe.", 375464.0, 2735643.0, 3, 6, "MedEye", null, null, null, "h2020_207428_999600521"], [1201824000000, 1343692800000, "Coeliac Disease \u2013 Management, Monitoring and Diagnosis using Biosensors and an Integrated Chip  System", "The Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals Nhs Foundation Trust", "The overall concept of the CD-MEDICS IP is to develop a technology platform for point-of-care diagnostics, capable of simultaneous genomic and proteomic detection, with embedded communication abilities for direct interfacing with hospital information systems. This will be achieved by exploiting breakthroughs at the confluences of bio-, micro- and nano- technologies to create a low-cost non-invasive intelligent diagnosis system.  This platform will be developed in a modular format, which will allow each module to be developed and exploited individually.  The modules will subsequently be integrated to facilitate the desired application.  Advances in data communications, molecular biology and biosensor technology, with the integration of nanostructured functional components in macro and microsystems, will facilitate the realisation of a minimally invasive generic platform, which is capable of multi-parametric monitoring and will be interoperable with electronic medical records.  The advantages of integrated biosensor systems include their ease of use, their sensitivity, their inherent selectivity (preventing problems due to interfering substances), their versatility (allowing 'in-field' use) and their cost effectiveness. Addressing the future health care requirement of an individualised theranostic approach, the specific application that will be demonstrated in this IP will be for the management, monitoring and diagnosis of coeliac disease, with the proposed technology contributing to significant advances in sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. The technology platform developed, however, could be applied to a variety of clinical screening applications, such as cancer.
