The afore-mentioned elements will be integrated into state-of-the-art flood risk management strategies and will be developed, tested and validated via pilot study sites.

At the same time, in the context of Energy\u2019s savings, Industry is experiencing a renewed interest in the domain of industrial superconductivity with fault current limiters, wind generators, electric energy storage, etc. Besides, Medical Research shows a strong interest in High-Field MRI, especially for the brain observation. Considering the social impact of the investment of the HL-LHC project and FCC study, CERN and CEA have established a Working Group on Future Superconducting Magnet Technology (FuSuMaTech).The Working Group has explored a large spectrum of possible synergies with Industry, and has proposed a set of relevant R&D&I projects to be conducted between Academia and industry. To keep the leading position of Europe in the domain, the most efficient way is to support joint activities of Industry and academic partners on the common concerns in view of overcoming the technological barriers. The FuSuMaTech Initiative aims to create the frame of collaborations and to provide common tools to all the EU actors of the domain. The FuSuMatech Initiative is a dedicated and large scale silo breaking programme which will create a sustainable European Cluster in applied Superconductivity. It will enlarge the innovative potential especially in High Field NMR and MRI, opening future breakthroughs in the brain observation. The FuSuMaTech Phase 1 is the first step of the FuSuMaTech Initiative. It is based on practical cases studies and will consist in preparing:\n1. The administrative and legal conditions;\n2.

The impact of the application of these so called 3D devices  on circuit topology and logic design will be explored.

Limited intersectoral collaboration has led to compartmentalised thinking which has become an impediment to improved resource and energy efficiency.\nThe overall aim of MetalIntelligence is to disrupt this compartmentalisation, by training 6 ESRs through a multi-disciplinary network of academic and industry leaders with an exceptionally broad range of expertise and skills. The team comprises three beneficiaries (2 academic, in Ireland and Sweden, and one Industry, Finland) as well as 4 partners (from the UK, Ireland, and Finland) who will provide secondment opportunities and/or industrial supervision.\nThe programme is arranged as work packages (WPs), including management, training, and dissemination as well as three research-driven packages.

The prospects of solving this problem by \u201cbigger machines\u201d are uncertain and of poor return, given the high maturity already achieved by NMR/MRI. This ETN challenges this status from an untapped perspective, combining NMR/MRI with nuclear hyperpolarization eliciting signals that surpass those currently available by up to 50,000x.

However,  less  than 30% of patients can achieve target  levels of glucose control with this approach even  in a clinical trial setting  and many patients are either unable or unwilling to make  the personal commitment required. By contrast, preservation of even  small amounts of endogenous insulin production, has been shown  to improve glycaemic control, reduce hypoglycaemia, improve quality of life and reduce long-term complications. Importantly, glycemic control in the presence of endogenous beta  cell function is not demanding and hence would be effective across the full spectrum of individuals.  Antigen specific immunotherapy (ASI) is the preferred approach to beta  cell preservation since  this avoids  the risks of immunosuppression. Attempts  at ASI to date  although successful in preclinical models have  had limited efficacy in humans. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of novel approaches to deliver effective ASI.\nOur Enhanced Epidermal \u2013 Antigen Specific Immunotherapy (EE-ASI) system represents an innovative  approach to ASI created by combining  technologies brought  by our academic and 2 SME partners.

Business and society need young people with adequatge qualifications. With the project \u201cExperience European Business\u201c we also want to further internationalise the education at our school. Beyond that, we believe that positive experiences from international exchange may counter tendencies towards sharper national differentiation.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe emphasis is on the development of professional competences of the trainees, which we define as language, commercial, intercultural and social competences. Interns shall be placed in interesting companies. In this way they are challenged to use and extend their knowledge and skills. Thus, their chances on the Austrian and international labour market are rising (\u201eemployability\u201c). Moreover, they shall be increasingly able to take an active part in European life and to accept the challenges of a more and more diverse society and of digitalisation in a positive way. The participating institutions (school, companies) should also share their experiences and benefit from them.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nIn the first year of the project we assume that 16 to 20 students from the third to the fifth grade will take part in this specific project. They will be active for 4 to 8 weeks, to the biggest part in UK, and also in Italy. We hope to arrange internships in other countries, too. Hosting organisations will be various businesses (accountancy, trade, services, municipality, etc.), which will offer varied professional experiences. In the second year of the project we expect about the same number of participants. We want to encourage learners from our evening school to also participate; so far we have not succeeded.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nLearners will be prepared in special workshops for their jobs regarding language acquisition, job relevant activities and organization management. The project team and teachers of diverse subjects will participate here. Practical and logistical preparations are done on an individual basis with each participant, also in cooperation with partners in the host country (e.g. Go English). After the internships the experiences will be passed on to a various target groups in different formats (peer-to-peer activities, reports, presentations,\u2026).\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nThe Absolventenvereinigung der Handelsakademien Klagenfurt (Association of graduates of the business college Klagenfurt) as the applicant body is responsible for the processing of the project and cooperates intensively with the business college (HAK) in Klagenfurt. For this reason a separate bank account was opened. An optimal coordination is guaranteed through close personal interrelations. For UK internships our partner Go English is intensively involved in finding adequate companies and suitable accommodation, and in supporting our trainees on site. Further stakeholders, such as parents, will regularly be implicated.\r\nThe application of instruments on the Europass and ECVET-basis will also assure the quality of the execution and the internships.\r\n\r\nExpected results and impact:\r\nMainly the learners will profit from the projects directly, as their professional, social, language and cultural skills will certainly be advanced. With a highly regarded internship abroad they will obviously have great advantages on the labour market that looks for motivated, open-minded and well-educated applicants.\r\nAlso the sending institutions will have the opportunity to share the experiences of the trainees. They (respectively the involved persons) will improve their competences in international project organisation. The teachers will benefit from this projects by expanding their experiences through post-proceeding activities and by passing them on to their other students.\r\nMoreover, the region will profit from higher qualified young people in economic and social respects.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefit:\r\n2018 will be the third year of our mobility project. We hope to extend it in the future \u2013 also geographically. In the long term, we would like to create a sustainable culture of internationality in education. We hope that we will be able to inspire young people for this path.
