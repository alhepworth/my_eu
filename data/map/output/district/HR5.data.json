Their objective is to get deep into self-chosen experiments, conduct them and truly understand the theory behind. Then they \u201cbreak down\u201c the complex matter, write a manual (\"cookbook\") in simple language, illustrate it with sketches, drawings or photos so that 10-year-olds can understand the experiments. 10-year-old pupils are invited to a big event called \u201cLab-Night\u201c. Under the supervision of 3 science teachers. The older students then guide the younger ones through the experiments, which they should ideally be able to conduct without much help. This is documented for each experiment and shared with the partner schools.At project meetings the host school organises a \"European Lab-Night\" for the 3 partners.  Some experiments will be presented to the partners, others carried out together and experience shared. In the course of their preparations for the \"Lab-Night\" the students collect technical terms and create a dictionary in at least 3 languages as an app for mobiles (\"Mobile Science Dictionary\"). They do research on science-related job opportunities in their respective vicinity with special focus on availability for EU-members. Every 2 months a video conference is scheduled to share and discuss the state of the work.", "http://www.lhs.hereford.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE03-KA219-022913_2"]]}}}}
