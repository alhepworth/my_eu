Step by step students plan everyday life on the island. They start with a map of the island, they also set up a government and elect the president democrately . Then they have to establish elementary laws . Afterwards they design houses using their creative imagination and plan the island's budget . Besides all of this, they also need to arrange the   island entertainment - sports, theatre. Schools for survivors' kids, restaurants and entrepreneurship games will be also included in project work.\r\nThe students will  have to communicate with each other, making compromises, learning making decisions in democratic way,  they have to act using as many skills as possible.  Through the student exchanges we also aim to give travel and intercultural exchange opportunities and so reduce barriers to mobility across Europe whilst also promoting language learning to all children. The experience the children have with people from other cultures differs greatly in our countries. Whereas  Greek or Sicilian  schools  are situated  in touristic places - multinational areas and children there have a lot of contact with different cultures, the Polish village  doesn\u2019t have foreign visitors at all. The children in Polish school do not travel much and therefore have little first-hand experience with other European countries. All schools report that ignorance about other countries and cultures leads to disrespectful comments and conflicts in the classroom and in the  playground.  By the project we want to change this attitude in our pupils. \r\nICT activities in all project tasks develop the children\u2019s computer skills and ensure access for all children to modern technology. \r\nMost of the tasks  like the Island's Entertainment  and the production of CDs and DVDs aim to promote a sense of entrepreneurship.", "http://www.platanoscollege.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PL01-KA219-038533_5"], [2014, "Enhancing language learning through culture", "Platanos College", 18181.0, 1, 1, "As a department, we want to offer our children the best possible learning experience.

Our students are very multicultural but have little experience or understanding of what it means to be part of Europe.  Our principal visited the municipality of Jarfalla, Sweden in 2013 and in January 2015 we hosted the headteacher Johan Nystrom Hjertvinge and colleagues from Viksj\u00f6skolanon a visit to Saint Gabriel's College, which was supported by the local authority international officer.  At that visit we put together plans for a joint project which can improve professional practice in teaching and learning between the two schools.Through self-evaluation and external monitoring (Ofsted), Saint Gabriel's College has identified areas for development in teaching and learning. These areas have been built into the schools development plan and various strategies have been initiated throughout this year to address ways in which teachers can develop new teaching methods. This 'Dedication to Excellence' project address just one aspect of the development plan, developing international links in order to develop the quality of teaching. The areas we would like to address are as follows:Differentiation in the mixed-ability classroom - The school has recently changed from setting to mixed ability for key stage 3. Staff feedback have highlighted that there is a need for staff to develop strategies of teaching mixed ability as this is something they feel they struggle with.Challenge for higher ability learners - The demographic of pupil applying for Saint Gabriel's College is changing. Whereas previously pupils were less able (Low band and middle band) they are now more able in Year 7. It is essential our teachers are skilled enough to address this. Ofsted feedback, Lesson observations from the senior leaders and also data analysis has highlighted this as a major area for improvement. Assessment - Nationally, levels no longer exist and schools are required to create their own strategies to assess learners understanding. Citizenship (including citizenship of the EU) - Whilst many of the students at Saint Gabriel's come from across the world, mainly from West Africa and the Caribbean, they have very little understanding of what it means to be a member of of the European Union.  Likewise many staff have little experience of engagement with the EU. Curriculum Improvements - The government have recently overhauled the curriculum for 2016 - 2017. These are now very loose and faculties are responsible for the first time, for ensuring the curriculum meets the needs of all pupils (I.e. that it is broad and balanced) and that it is engaging and inspirational.Activities will include: - Staff to shadowed subject teachers in their subjects (develop teaching pedagogy/subject knowledge/teaching styles) - Staff to take part in lessons, where language isn't a barrier (develop teaching tools) - Staff to exchange resources (develop the curriculum) - Staff to meet with the leadership team and subject teachers to discuss the structure and how they lead learning (develop leadership and to develop the curriculum) - Staff to take part in day to day school life (develop knowledge of culture)Proficiency in the key teaching areas will be measured through a staff questionnaire before the participant goes, and again after the training has been delivered on their return.  Improvement in the quality of teaching will be measured through lesson observations and learning walk. Improvements to the curriculum will be measured from pupil questionnaires and also from faculty reviews, conducted by the leadership team. Pupil progress will be measured through in-year academic progress through the five Tracking Cycles which take place each year. The impact of the European citizenship dimension will be measured through student participation in the e-Twinning relationship and through assessment of their knowledge, enthusiasm and understanding of the European Union in Citizenship lessons. Cluster groups will collaborate to come up with a way to measure the impact of the strategy that they chose to implement.Moving forward, future strategies will include spreading our findings to ensure the local community benefit. We will disseminate information across our local cluster groups by sharing reports, sharing recommendations and strategies staff devised, overseeing the implementation of strategies in local schools, inviting teachers in the cluster to observe the participants who went to Sweden once they are implementing the best practice learned in their own lessons, ensuring teachers observe other teachers in the cluster once they have adopted and embedded some of the strategies.", "http://www.saintgabrielscollege.org", "Saint Gabriel's College", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023994_coordinator"]]}}, "7EX": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Be European - act with pride", "Be Enriched", 14091.0, 6, 6, "Be European: act with pride! - beap is a social project whose main objective is to promote the respect for the human dignity in spite of diversity; it aims to stimulate young people to analyze and deepen the topic of the respect of the human rights and to compare the specific problems faced at this regard by the participating Countries, finding concrete modalities to stimulate a  change in the community aimed at the rootedness of the values of the human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity, and acting personally to raise the social awareness of young people and state the importance of the human rights.\r\nThe youth exchange Be European: act with pride! will be held in Palermo from 23th to 30th June 2015.

Themed \"think globally, act locally\", approximately 160 people live, work and study here together. The goal of AMH/Tamera is to construct an exemplary pilot model for non-violent co-habitation among human beings and between people and nature.AMH/Tamera's work focusses on the education of young people in peace knowledge, the building of exemplary self-sufficient and sustainable living models, and global networking with environmental and peace groups and activists.Furthermore, the AMH/Tamera regional work in Portugal, including infrastructural, technological and ecological work increases the living standard and the diversity of cultural activities in a rural area such as Alentejo.As a research Centre, the main activities of AMH/Tamera are the dissemination of skills and knowledge in the fields of research of the \"Solar Village Project\" through seminars, conferences and workshops. AMH/Tamera is hosting more than 2000 visitors every year, coming from different cultural, religious and ethnic backgrounds to live, study and work together.The aim of AMH/Tamera is to exchange and disseminate the knowledge produced and the experiences made over the various topics of the \u201cSolar Village\u201d project. These areas of research in a holistic approach address the main issues of current day society, starting from the social, via the political to end not least with the ecological aspects of cooperation with nature and the generating of energy through sustainable sources.Within this larger context, the Activity of \"Monte Cerro - EVS for a new Culture\" is one of the actvities that matches these objectives of research, learning and disemination.Six EVS participants are welcome to spend 12 months with us and study and live together with volunteers from Europe and all over the world. Meeting other young volunteers from other parts of Europe, sharing everyday life and participating in the discussion circles as a tool for showing the inner longings and processes, gives the opportunity to get  to know other cultural, social and religious backgrounds which creates tolerance and supports social cohesion in the EU, as well as introspection and mutual understanding.The program  gives these young people the possibility to participate hands on in the building of the European Civil Society by the contact to such edge knowledge areas necessary for the creation of self-sufficient, decentralized living structures such as the Solar Village and enhances their skills and knowledge in both, practical and theoretical aspects.AMH/Tamera sees the project as an example of sustainable development for all of Europe. The volunteers take the knowledge to their home countries and can act as multipliers, having their chances for employment enhanced by their personal and professional growth.
