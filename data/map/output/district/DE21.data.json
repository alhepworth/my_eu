Rates of sexual violence against children and adults in Europe are clearly unacceptable, and sexual violence is still a hidden deed often surrounded by silence and denial.Sport enhances the lives of individuals in many ways, however, reports of sexual violence within sport are more evident now than at any point in the past. Young people, keen to succeed in sport, can be especially susceptible to sexual harassment and abuse, as can athletes with disabilities, and those from the LGBTI community. Tackling sexual violence in sport \u2013 and through sport \u2013 requires not only the implementation of policy, but also greater understanding of the problem within sports communities. The voices of those who have experienced sexual violence have been especially important for understanding the emergence of violence and for initiating cultural change. VOICE aims at combatting sexual violence in sport through the voices of those affected. A crucial research study in eight European countries will gather the accounts of those people who have experienced sexual violence in sport. Based on this and via a collaboration of sport organisations, victim support agencies and universities, a process of reconciliation will be initiated in each country by installing Acknowledgement Forums. The outcomes of the research study and the Forums will be transferred into powerful educational resources for the European sports community, which will be disseminated to a wide range of sport organisations in Europe, enhancing its capacity to combat sexual violence and strengthen the integrity of sport. VOICE is partnered by 4 European sport federations, 1 victim support agency and will be delivered in 8 EU countries through the collaboration of 24 organisations from higher education, sport and victim-support.", "http://www.nwgnetwork.org", null, "erasmus_567129-EPP-1-2015-2-DE-SPO-SCP_3"]]}}, "4TG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Work.Experience.Development- for You and Europe", "Travena Ltd", 87264.0, 3, 8, "The \"Rudolf Steiner Schulverein im Raum Baden\" is coordinating the project WORK.EXPERIENCE.DEVELOPMENT-FOR YOU AND EUROPE, which offers work placements for approximately 100 pupils aged 15 to 19 of the Waldorf Schools Sch\u00f6nau, Linz, Graz, Klagenfurt, Innbruck and Salzburg. Vocational orientation is an integral part of the Waldorf School curriculum in Austria, therefore the aim is to offer high quality work placements in Europe as a part of quality development in this field of the upper grades of the Waldorf Schools.\r\nThe participants do a 2 to 8 weeks work placement (agricultural training, industrial placement, social placement). Additional it will be possible for a few weaker pupils after finishing the Waldorf School  to do a long term placement to achieve more competences for a better start in their future career. Waldorf Schools are comprehensive schools with a wide range of knowledge from upper secondary school level to pupils with special needs. The receiving partners (SME, NGO, Charity organisations) are situated in 11 countries (Germany, Greece, Ireland, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Finland. Iceland, Malta) and choosen with  focus on sustainability. The partnerships are evaluated through the project reports of former Leonardo da Vinci projects and by personal contacts. New partners could join the project due to the students interests. We paid attention to geographical and language variety to offer a wide choice. In the field of project management the coordinators at the sending schools are working close together.\r\nIn the schools they support the pupils prior, during and after the mobility. They arrange Learning Agreements with the receiving partner and the student and are responsible for the validation of the learning results. At the regular project meetings problems are discussed, and any organisational questions are clarified. The evaluation meetings with the students are also organised then.\r\nWe expect good progress in the field of language skills, intercultural awareness, learning, initiative and especially personal development like increasing independence and self reliance and creativity. In the long term it enables the student to be an active part of society with a positiv effect  on employability and life long learning.", "http://www.travena.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT01-KA102-004793_6"]]}}, "6BF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1285891200000, 1380499200000, "Development of low-cost, lightweight Highly Insulating Polymers for refrigerated transport, heating and cooling installations", "Baxi Heating UK Limited", "Our members, as operators of refrigerated transport and installers of HVAC systems, are dependent on excellent insulation for energy efficiency. There are over 600,000 refrigerated vehicles and containers in Europe and each one wastes thousands of Euros of energy each year due to poor insulation. Likewise, payback on renewable energy systems is compromised by poor thermal storage, reducing their popularity. In short, our members are wasting energy and hence losing money through a lack of optimal insulation. Currently, our options are limited to expensive, high performance materials such as aerogels and vacuum insulation panels, or low-cost but poorly-performing foams. We need a new insulation material that can fill this performance gap, offering high thermal resistance but at a cost close to insulating foams. The HIP project will develop an innovative new class of polymer insulation materials based on high internal phase emulsion templating (HIPE). HIPE materials have been used in other applications but never before for high-performance insulation. HIPE materials allow close control over porosity, pore size distribution and mechanical properties. Because of this, we can precisely engineer the thermal properties of the material within a low-cost manufacturing process. Our objective is to achieve a thermal conductivity of \u22640.015W/m.K at a cost of less than \u20ac500 per cubic metre. Compared to conventional PU foam insulation, the savings will be considerable: Based on our predicted uptake in the refrigerated transport and solar thermal markets alone, the reduced CO2 emission will be over 200,000 tonnes by 2020 and our members will save in excess of \u20ac50 million in energy costs.", 47331.0, 2183624.0, 6, 12, "HIP", null, "http://www.heatraesadia.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/145859.jpg", "fp7_96236_991760011"]]}}, "6LY": {"cordis": {"data": [[1496275200000, 1512000000000, "Fresh Solutions \u2013\u2018A fresh approach to food packaging\u2019", "Four04 Packaging Limited", "Fresh Solutions \u2013\u2018A fresh approach to food packaging\u2019\nWithin the EU post production supply chain, it is estimated that 61.6 Million tonnes (Mt) of food waste is created p.a with\n46.5 Mt/year generated specifically by households . Approximately 60% of household food waste arises from products \u2018not\nused in time\u2019 with a value of more than \u20ac60 billion p.a (\u20ac624/household) the majority of which are short shelf-life chilled\nproducts. Similar shelf life challenges are found within the Retail sector with up to 33% of some fresh produce being wasted\nbefore it even reaches the consumer. Efforts to address this global challenge have centred around innovations that seek to prevent product deterioration and prolonging shelf life. However despite progress in techniques such as Modified Atmosphere Packaging, food waste remains a priority challenge, with the recognition that even a 1 day increase in shelf life could reduce waste levels both in store and home by up to 50% for some products. Fresh Solutions proposed by Four04 Packaging Ltd offers a unique approach to the packaging of perishable food by effectively controlling the detrimental effect of condensation, thermal shock and the respiration rate of fresh produce which contribute to the build-up of moisture in the packs and mould/bacterial growth. It combines an innovative bio-degradable and fully compostable film which allows the moisture vapour transmission rate to be controlled and a novel highly accurate laser perforation system which creates optimum atmospheric conditions within the packaging. The result is the potential to increase the shelf life of fresh produce by 30% \u2013 100% over current packaging techniques as demonstrated by initial UK supermarket trials. Building on this success, this SME I project seeks to further demonstrate Fresh Solutions in the wider EU and U.S markets, helping Four 04 to exploit a Global market for fresh food packaging forecast to reach \u20ac95.91bn by 2020 with a truly disruptive solution.", 44350.0, 63358.0, 1, 1, "Fresh Solutions", null, null, null, "h2020_210402_916627788"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "FOUR04 PACKAGING LIMITED", 43613.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_57602"]]}}}}
