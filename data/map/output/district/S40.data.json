In 2009, I applied for the first time to the European Agency for funding which was accepted. With this support, the European section of my school went to England in March 2010. This is now our sixth grant application which enables our school to organise students' mobility to Chesterfield (GB) and (for the first time) to Salamanca (Spain). The students involved are preparing a BTEC in trade science and administrative management.\r\nTo carry out the task and my European project, I\u2019ve set up since September 2009 a working group in our vocational school consisting of English teachers and more recently of Spanish teachers, interested in taking part in our European section. We have renewed this year the organisation of a 12 months programme in order that our 10 students of English European section can go to England and 8 of our Spanish section can go to Spain in March/April 2015. They will undertake a 4 week internship in the workplace.\r\nOur 18 students will participate in English and Spanish online training organised by The European agency. They will also attend\r\na few hours of language training on site financed with own funds in order to enjoy sharing in sports and cultural activities with other young people . Teachers will be there every step of the way to help and guide them if needed and they will look after them on-site on a rotating schedule for the whole month. I will be helping French students with the Spanish intermediary partner in Spain, Mr. Gonzalo Hierro in Spain at the beginning of the stay and at the end for the final evaluation in workplaces.\r\n \r\nOn our last visit to Great Britain, we have set objectives and  negotiated  training targets with our partners in England and with our intermediary partner in Spain \u201cTellus Group\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe project has 3 facets :\r\n\r\n - a pedagogical facet at the beginning during preparation of work placement and during language training online and on site in order to help students in their future internship and then, at the end to help them in writing what they\u2019ve done and learned.\r\n\r\n- a Professional facet  when young people are on work placements in England and Spain. A part of the professional skills has been negotiated with tutors in 2013 in Great Britain and in March 2014 during the preliminary visit in Spain. The skills will be subject to revision with partners at the beginning of the training period in line with students\u2019 language level if necessary. In that way, students should have a better and more meaningfull experience.\r\n\r\n- a cultural and transversal facet which is part of a promising project ERASMUS PLUS. This facet is necessary because it\u2019s directly linked to our school\u2019s activities in the European section when our students perform well in international tests as BTEC with European option and EUROPRO and EUROPASS; It\u2019s a perfect match with the economic sector needs in our region around our town Oyonnax which looks for autonomous and professional  young people who speak foreign languages in order to compete internationally .", "http://www.clarendonguesthouse.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-000796_1"]]}}, "2UB": {"cordis": {"data": [[1441065600000, 1509408000000, "Efficient Aluminium Salt cake Recycling Technology", "Altek Europe Limited", "Aluminium is the world\u2019s second most used metal.  During aluminium extraction and recycling, salt slag is generated in vast volume and is a growing environmental problem. In Europe there are >270 known aluminium processing plants and only nine salt slag recycling facilities, this number is restricted due to economic viability of operation; there are very high initial capital cost and high operating costs. These costs create a high entry barrier for any new company to enter into the salt recycling business. EU countries such as Scandinavia and Eastern Europe transport many thousands of tonnes of salt slag p.a. thousands of kilometres for processing at the few locations available at enormous financial and environmental cost.\n\nThis is a threat to the aluminium production industry as costs to process salt slag are becoming extremely high.  Due to the monopolisation of re-processing options, it is a financial security issue for the aluminium recyclers as they are in the hands of the nine salt slag recyclers in operation. This highlights an industry need for aluminium recycling companies to manage in house all of their by-products and waste materials economically.\n\nALTEK is a technology-based company with specialist expertise and experience in aluminium technology.  With EC FP7 funding support, ALTEK have developed to TRL 6, ALUSALT, an in-house salt slag processing unit that offers aluminium recycling plants an economic solution to salt slag processing, reducing energy process requirements,  transport costs and CO2 emissions. ALUSALT offers the industry a solution that complies with EU legislation, reduces environmental impact and can achieve cost savings of \u20ac1.95m p.a. (based on a 10,000 tonnes p.a salt slag producer). It is envisaged ALUSALT will revolutionise the industry saving \u20ac33.15m and 19,550 tonnes of CO2 p.a. based on 6.23% EU market penetration.

Secondary aluminium recycling and ceramic processing were identified as key examples with economically recoverable waste heat. Several challenges are inherent; these processes are batch-based rather than continuous with corrosive particulate-laden flue gas over a wide temperature range. The Smartrec system meets these challenges by development of a standard, modular solution for integration of heat recovery with thermal storage that valorises medium to high grade waste heat, adaptable to different temperatures and industries. Following end-user analysis and characterisation of exhaust streams and waste products, full life cycle costing and assessment will be carried out with candidate molten salts selected for thermal storage and heat transfer fluid, validated by corrosion testing. A custom heat pipe heat exchanger will be modelled and designed around the requirements of heat transport capacity wick structure and capable of heat exchange with a molten salt pumping loop. This loop will include dual media thermocline thermal storage system with cost/system modelling, validation and instrumentation incorporated. A pilot Smartrec system will be constructed and deployed in a secondary aluminium recycler and/or ceramic processor valorising high grade heat for continuous energy-intensive salt-cake recycling. Smartrec will be validated by integration with existing systems with >6 months operation including a fully developed instrumentation framework.

Salt cake is a mixture of aluminum oxides and aluminum nitrides, metal and salts (mainly NaCl and KCl, with small amounts of MgCl2 and CaCl2).\nThe salt cake is a growing environmental problem.  It is proving very difficult to dispose in the Europe and is regarded as hazardous waste. The reason is that when saltcake gets wet it gives of gases, e.g. hydrogen, methane, ammonia. Also water leaching out of the land fill would contain chlorides.\nThe alternative is to try and recycle the saltcake and reclaim the aluminium, aluminium oxide and salt. This is done by grinding up the saltcake and separating out the free aluminium. The residue if then mixed with water, which dissolves out the salts, which are later re crystallised and sold back to the secondary aluminium smelters and aluminium oxide, which may be used in abrasive industry or in the manufacturing of cement.\nThe current technology has high initial and operating cost and not economical in small volume and that is why there are only few aluminium salt cake recycling facilities exist in the Europe. All the salt cake generated by the aluminium recycling plants have to transport the salt cakes to these facilities, which results a large amount of cost due to transportation and associated CO2 emission.\nThe project aims to develop an in situ salt cake recycling technology that will utilize the excess of heat from the flue gas from the rotary furnace and able to reprocess salt cake more efficiently and more economically also in small volume.\nThe process will allow recycling salt cakes in situ at the aluminium recycling plant, without the need for transporting the salt cakes to the salt cake recyclers.
