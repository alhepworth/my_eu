In order to do this, there is a need in both regions to develop the skills of teachers to deliver the support required by students when considering their next steps on their career or further education pathway. Sound and informed careers guidance that prepare young people for working not only in their home country but across Europe is vital. The project will seek to develop a working relationship between teachers who are working in technical vocational settings. Using the expertise of Connexions Bucks and Research Guidance Center in Yalova, lessons will be improved to engage disaffected young people and enhance their ability to make informed decisions will be developed in collaboration with teaching staff in both countries. At the same time, the project will have 2 technical vocational insitutions; one  in Yalova which is very established and has national recognition for the work they do. Therefore, it is a great opportunity to bring colleagues together in different contexts but each with a similar challenge of supporting young people moving forward in their future education and work choice. Both educational settings have different areas of expertise and it is the intention of the project for teaching staff to support development of areas that require strengthening in each institution. Students in both countries will be included in the discussions about what they believe in career guidance should focus on from their perspective and feed their views into planned interventions. It is anticipated that once we get feedback from the survey and the professionals in the project,we have had an opportunity to discuss and debate practices in the field of career, guidance and counselling.The professionals involved in the project will develop a suite of lesson plans for use in the classroom and a guidance document for the teachers to go alongside the lessons which will be able to support young people look at their future life choices. We acknowledge that there are some good practices in both regions and to this end we intend to develop case studies of good practices which will be shared with colleagues locally, nationally and at a European level. A virtual learning environment will be set up to support deeper discussions and the sharing of materials and resources between teachers/ educators in both institutions and a website for the purpose of dissemination of the project and resources developed . What we aim to achieve by this project is a consistent method for teaching good career and guidance counselling through the development of a module of work that can be used anywhere in both Bucks and Yalova and ultimately across Europe. It is very important that the decisions a student makes regarding his future are deliberate and purposeful, that the young person would understand that adaptation to the world of business and their emotional well being  depends on the right choice.

The industry is therefore continuously aiming for increases in integrated circuit miniaturization, processor speeds and circuit densities. The resultant increasing numbers of ever finer features on the silicon chip, and the need to electrically connect to them has stretched conventional wired or leaded electronics interconnect technology to its limits. This trend of miniaturisation with higher functionality looks set to continue, requiring fundamental advances in device electrical interconnect and mounting technology. Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs) is a key technology that simultaneously addresses the requirements for high density fine feature electrical interconnect and physical attachment of silicon chip devices. BGA is a 2-D array of miniature solder alloy spheres under the silicon chip that provides both electrical connection and mechanical attachment to a mounting socket or circuit board. The small diameter of the solder alloy spheres reduces electrical resistance and capacitance and helps to preserve electrical signal integrity. BGA technology facilitates a reduction in the silicon chip package size, better heat dissipation, and greater module (circuit) densities. Typical mobile phones and laptops contain 3,000 and 6,000 BGAs respectively. These BGAs are inside CPU, RAM, DSP, Memory sticks, Consumer electronic etc. The \u03bcBGAS project aims at wider SME companies who are interested in the development of novel production techniques for producing \u03bcBGAs of less than 150\u03bcm.

Turkish Confederation of Employer Association has interpreted the average rate of early school dropout in Turkey as 37% (39, 5 % among girls and 35% among boys). It is also asserted that the children who left school are under the risk of committing crime and early school leaving is described as the kindergarden of juvenile delinquency (Gavin, 1997).  The children falling into the category of early school leavers and juvenile delinquents are generally from disadvantaged backgrounds with fewer opportunities and are given priority by European Commission. \r\nOur project aims to provide key competencies to develop the measures to prevent early school leaving; to decrease the risk of those to commit crime; to guide them back to their education or vocational education to get qualified enough to find a good job and integrate them into social life; to develop a new joint methodology to tackle those; to prepare a e-training course including this new methodology and implementations; to train the adults dealing with these children and as a result  to contribute to decrease the rates of leaving school prematurely and juvenile delinquency to fewer than 10% by 2020.\r\nThe project targets mainly people who are in close relationship with truants and juvenile delinquents such as; parents, teachers, principals, community and juvenile police officers, counselors, lectures training these people etc. via on line in-service trainings.\r\nSeven different organizations from public bodies to NGOs with different expertise and experience about early school dropout and juvenile delinquency cooperate within the context of our project according to their expertise.
