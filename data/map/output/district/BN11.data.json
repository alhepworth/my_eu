The international strategy has been implemented on three levels; firstly, 38 students (trainee educators) take part in a 3 or 20-week placement abroad through the Leonardo da Vinci programme, secondly, 8 teachers also take part in a foreign exchange programme with a chosen partner organization. Thirdly, the PFH also participates in an educational exchange with an organisation in Turkey.\r\nThrough the comparative study of vocational training and education systems in both their own country and other European countries, students broaden their comprehension of the diverse ways in which to best support children in their development. The mobility offered to students through this programme provides an irreplaceable addition to the theoretical course, and is integral in developing conceptual, methodological and personal competences. Comparative analysis of curricular concepts, structure and attitude towards institutional education in different European countries, along with current debates, is an essential part of this vocational training. It also plays an important role in the establishment of our future European culture, and the evolution of the German educational system as a whole.\r\nThe lecturers of the vocational college, have an avowed interest in developing the international component of the training programme. Intercultural experiences and study of \u201cbest practice\u201d, provides them with competences to teach to the highest standards possible.\r\nDuring the project, 24 students complete a 20-week practical placement abroad, as a component of their overall training programme.  To ensure a complete monitoring of their placement, the students write weekly and monthly reports, which are reviewed by their tutor. Reflection and comparison of country-specific approaches to education are a focus of these reports. 14 students complete a 3-week foreign placement, principally in neighbouring countries. As an addition to their required training placements, this residence is undertaken to broaden their understanding of \u201cother\u201d educational systems and to gain intercultural experiences. \r\nThe teaching group (8 teachers) in the vocational training college is comprised of university\u2013educated personnel and trained teachers. The aim of both the institution and the faculty is to obtain the highest level of knowledge about the education and social care systems in different European countries and meet the requirements of the training programme. Through one-week on-site visits the faculty are able to learn about different organisational structures as well as understand and assess pedagogical social work in another European country. A particular focus of discussion is the standard of vocational training, with specific reference to the role of the \u201cpractical placement\u201d. The classification of different educator training programmes with reference to the EQF is looked at from a \u201cdifferent\u201d perspective and information is shared about comparative vocational qualifications in Europe. On-site visits, expert discussions, evaluations and presentations of findings, all constitute essential parts of this comparative study.  \r\nThe project leader works on behalf of and in consultation with the school administration in managing the project.

We believe that disabled people should have the freedom to live their lives the way they choose - with the opportunity and support to live independently, to contribute economically, and to participate fully in society. The needs and aspirations of disabled people are at the heart of what we do. \r\n\r\nThe EVS project will take place in three Leonard Cheshire services, located across the UK: Fethneys, Bradbury House and Arnold House.  The project involve 6 volunteers, 2 volunteers per every service and will last 12 months with starting dates in March and May 2016. The volunteers are aged from 22 to 29 years old and  come from Egypt, Germany, Greece and Spain. \r\n\r\nVolunteers selected for this project have background in social work, psychology, education or engineering and logistics and have previous personal or professional experience supporting people with disabilities. They are great candidates with the right among of experience and interest in disability issues, and they all express their wish to continue working towards bettering the conditions and rights for people with disability and interest in developing their personal competences as well as in the field social care and working with disabled people as well as gaining international experience. \r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the project is goes in line with our organisational goal: to ensure that residents are provided with the opportunity to live their lives the way they choose - with the support to live independently. This is achieved through the following objectives:\r\n1. To introduce new, diversified activities to the activities programme and introduce intercultural perspective\r\n2. To support residents in fulfilling personal long-term goals and with accessing local community services and leisure activities\r\n3. To promote local and international volunteering\r\n4.

To support fundraising efforts to raise funds that will support the above mentioned aim\r\n\r\nOur members of staff provide the necessary care and assistance to enable residents to live as independent and full a life as possible.  However, it is the volunteer who can give extra time and attention to the residents. Our volunteers are actively involved in shaping their EVS experiences by developing the activities plan with residents and staff. Volunteers bring their own ideas, skills and passions to share with residents. As a result, the role is varied depending on their own skills and interests, and the needs of residents and the activities they like to engage in. \r\n\r\nActivities take place either in the home or in the local areas, and the delivery of activities is heavily influenced by the skills and motivation of our volunteers to design a creative and fun activity programme. Activities include but are not limited to: arts and craft workshops, quizzes, IT workshops, music group, movement, cooking and gardening. The care homes also organise special events such as fundraising, holiday celebrations, cultural evenings or sports nights. Volunteers also support on social outings, day trips and educational events such as attending college classes.\r\n\r\nDiversity of activities and enhanced individual support will encourage residents to set new goals and be more open to try new things and in particular to contribute more to the local community. This will improve residents' confidence which we envisage will lead to long term benefits of getting residents to do things like volunteering, organising events, talking about disability issues in the local community and be more involved in decisions made locally and nationally in regards to the care sector and disability issues.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact of the project for the volunteers is to become ambassadors for disability issues. It is expected that the participants will continue to promote disability rights and work towards a society that values disabled and non-disabled people equally.

Our network comprises numerous companies, institutions, organisations and individuals from the fields of economics, tourism, culture and administration, as well as the educational and social sectors.\r\nOne of the main aims of our project is to expand the already existing local, regional and national network to an international scale and, thus, to further enhance the modern profile of our college. Furthermore, in line with our school\u2019s principles of mutual appreciation and respect, an immersion in other cultures will heighten the participants\u2018 tolerance and regard for specific cultural features of other nations. Similarly, it will broaden their personal and professional horizons.\r\nAt a time of continuing globalisation, an internationalisation of vocational colleges is essential. Austria has served as a role model in this sector of higher education and it should retain and even strengthen its position in this field. Our project is intended to contribute to this goal by enhancing the image of vocational colleges and, in the future, promoting the international mobility of their teaching staff.\r\nIt is evident that the students taking part in this project are expected to get to know new working methods and test their competences in the world of work: that applies for foreign language skills as well as competences required in the hospitality industry or in event management. These personal goals go hand in hand with the political goal of supporting international communication and exchange in order to strengthen the cooperation on a professional, economic and cultural level within the European Union. \r\nThe 11 participants of the project have benefitted from high-quality training and education in languages, economics and general knowledge and have already-tried-and-tested practical skills. Some of them have also acquired additional qualifications: from language and computer certificates to the title of junior sommelier,  as well as qualifications in catering, event management and marketing. Apart from their sound theoretical knowledge in a wide range of subjects and practical know-how in kitchen and service they have excellent social and communicative skills.\r\nAll our students are required to do work placements. These last between 12 weeks, which our students specialising in economic professions and professions in the service industries have to do after their third year, and 8 weeks for students specialising in event management and cultural studies (to be completed at a number of different cultural organisations between their second and final year at our school). Because of these different requirements and specialisations, our students will do a range of different tasks: from routine as well as highly-qualified duties in the hospitality industry to professional organisation of events or seminars. For the participants of the project getting to know new working methods and reflecting on them is key, as is learning about cultural differences and similarities.\r\nThe project was introduced to students and their parents in October 2013. Subsequently, the students were nominated for participation by a small team according to selected criteria that included professional as well as social skills.\r\nThe anticipated outcome of the project is that participants will gain professional experience in an international context, show an increased and lasting interest in cultural exchange, and develop their social and linguistic skills. In the long term we hope to extend the existing network of our school internationally, to strengthen our climate of tolerance and respect and to receive additional impulses for further professional and institutional development.\r\nThe experiences and results gathered during the project will be presented in an exhibition which will take place at our school in the autumn of 2014. With this display we intend to motivate potential future participants and reinforce the international orientation of our school.", "http://www.chatsworthworthing.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-AT01-KA102-000355_1"]]}}, "3NJ": {"nhs": {"data": [["RX2", "Acre Day Hospital", "nhs_RX224"]]}}}}
