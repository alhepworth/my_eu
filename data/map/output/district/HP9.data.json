A light and agile redundant robotic cell with 20 degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) and an advanced processing unit for pre- and intra-operative control will operate both autonomously and cooperatively with surgical staff on the brain, a loosely structured environment. As the patient will not be considered rigidly fixed to the operating table and/or to the robot, the system will push the boundaries of the state of the art in the fields of robotics and control for the accuracy and bandwidth required by the challenging and complex surgical scenario.<br/>Two cooperating robots will interact with the brain that will deform for the tool contact, blood pressure, breathing and deliquoration. Human factors are considered by allowing easy interaction with the users through a novel haptic interface for tele-manipulation and by a collaborative control mode ('hands-on'). Force and video feedback signals will be provided to surgeons. Active constraints will limit and direct tool tip position, force and speed preventing damage to eloquent areas, defined on realistic tissue models updated on-the-field through sensors information. The active constraints will be updated (displaced) in real time in response to the feedback from tool-tissue interactions and any additional constraints arising from a complex shared workspace. The overarching control architecture of ACTIVE will negotiate the requirements and references of the two slave robots.<br/>The operative room represents the epitome of a dynamic and unstructured volatile environment, crowded with people and instruments. The workspace will thus be monitored by environmental cameras, and machine learning techniques will be used for the safe workspace sharing. Decisions about collision avoidance and downgrading to a safe state will be taken autonomously, the movement of the head of the patient will be filtered by a bespoke active head frame, while fast and unpredictable patient motion will be compensated by a real-time cooperative control system. Cognitive skills will help to identify the target location in the brain and constrain robotic motions by means of on-field observations.", 81230.0, 6316715.0, 6, 19, "ACTIVE", null, null, null, "fp7_97338_983284248"]]}}, "1LG": {"creative": {"data": [[1514764800000, 1546214400000, "INSIDE PICTURES", "THE NATIONAL FILM AND TELEVISION SCHOOL", 190813.0, 1, 1, "Inside Pictures is a film business and leadership skills development programme for senior executives and producers from across the world.

Nanotechnology is a truly enabling technology, with unlimited potential for innovation. However, the novelty in properties and forms of NMs makes the development of a well-founded and robust legislative framework to ensure safe development of nano-enabled products particularly challenging. At the heart of the challenge lies the difficulty in the reliable and reproducible characterisation of NMs given their extreme diversity and dynamic nature, particularly in complex environments, such as within different biological, environmental and technological compartments. Two key steps can resolve this: 1) the development of a holistic framework for reproducible NM characterisation, spanning from initial needs assessment through method selection to data interpretation and storage; and 2) the embedding of this framework in an operational, linked-up ontological regime to allow identification of causal relationships between NMs properties, be they intrinsic, extrinsic or calculated, and biological, (eco)toxicological and health impacts fully embedded in a mechanistic risk assessment framework.  ACEnano was conceived in response to the NMBP 26 call with the aim to comprehensively address these two steps. More specifically ACEnano will introduce confidence, adaptability and clarity into NM risk assessment by developing a widely implementable and robust tiered approach to NM physico-chemical characterisation that will simplify and facilitate contextual (hazard or exposure) description and its transcription into a reliable NMs grouping framework.  This will be achieved by the creation of a conceptual \u201ctoolbox\u201d that will facilitate decision-making in choice of techniques and SOPs, linked to a characterisation ontology framework for grouping and risk assessment and a supporting data management system.", 351821.0, 9387694.0, 9, 26, "ACEnano", null, null, null, "h2020_206749_917703130"]]}}, "2TS": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Unite Ambassadors- for Peace and Cohesion Program", "Alfriston School", 111235.0, 3, 7, "Unite Ambassadors for Peace and Cohesion is a Strategic Partnership project to produce and share an accredited scheme for young people.
