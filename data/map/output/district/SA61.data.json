The growing importance of Diversity Education has led the college to expand its range of work placements to students and trainees to include a two-week work placement in a school catering for pupils with disabilities for the 2016-2018 bid. The project is important for the college, staff and student development in that it- increases the interest in European languages other than English at the colleges, such as Spanish and Polish in the areas of hospitality and catering and pre-school education- provides childcare students and trainees from the Hospitality and Catering Dept. with the opportunity to practise and improve their English in the UK- enables teaching staff to participate in job-shadowing visits which expands the network of contacts to other EU colleges which promotes the European dimension in the college and its curricula- places a strong focus on the professional development of the language and subject tutors in that they gain experience through job shadowing and training courses in their respective subjects such as Spanish, ICT, childcare and diversity education- motivates teachers and other college departments that are not yet active in EU projects to support the EU Project Management Team in organising and carrying out projects inside and outside the classroom.Six students from an A-level course ending with a vocational qualification in childcare and education (Berufliches Gymnasium) will complete a two-week work placement at a childcare centre in Leeds. A further six students will complete a two-week work placement in a nursery school in Glasgow, while three students will have the opportunity to work for a fortnight at a school for pupils with disabilities in the same city. Six apprentices from the department of hospitality and catering will complete a two-week work placement in a hotel or restaurantin Pembroke, Wales or Glasgow, Scotland, while six trainees from the same department will have the opportunity to  expand their existing professional competences while working at the Alexander the Great Beach Hotel in Greece. Both groups of learners will have the opportunity to improve, adapt or attain knowledge, attitudes and skills in each of the followingareas:- reflect upon vocational training/working conditions of early learning practitioners, teaching staff at schools for disabled pupils or hotel/restaurant staff in another country- gain insight into the professional mentality of practitioners and hotel/restaurant staff in another country- re-evaluate their own opinions about the relevance of the European Union on a personal and vocational level- learn to adapt to a new hierarchy in the hosting childcare centre in the UK or hotel/restaurant in the UK or Greece- expand their knowledge of methodology and pedagogics in early learning or in diversity education in the UK or of hotel and restaurant management in the UK or Greece- act as ambassadors for Germany and the German language.Thirteen members of KKBKHA staff will participate in job shadowing visits to England, Wales, Scotland, Greece, Poland and Spain. Two language tutors will attend teacher training courses for the languages English and Spanish. In addition, the college EU project coordinator will attend a seminar in London in preparation for the 2017 Erasmus+ bid for Strategic Partnerships as the college plans to submit a funding application to finance a project that aims at engaging refugees through art projects.The main long-term benefit of the project is that there will be increased support for EU projects and work placements abroad at the KKBKHA from students, trainees and teaching staff. Our existing network of European contacts will grow and the European dimension will be incorporated in a long-term way into the curricula of the various departments. The EU Project Management Team will profit from increased support from teaching staff in all departments of the college to whom tasks such as the initiation and organisation of new projects can be delegated to support long-term success.", "http://www.pembrokeshire.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-003158_8"]]}}, "1TP": {"esif": {"data": [[1448409600000, 1551312000000, "Cynnydd", "Pembrokeshire County Council", "Providing a full range of engagement, learning and training activities for 11\u201319 year olds in order to reduce the number of young people who are at risk of becoming NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training).", "ESF", 13333118.0, 19047312.0, "esf_wales_80833"], [1491004800000, 1585612800000, "Cam Nesa", "Pembrokeshire County Council", "Providing a full range of engagement, learning and training activities for 16 \u2013 24 year olds in order to reduce Youth Unemployment and also reduce the number of young people who are NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training).
