The native Eurasian red squirrel (<i>Sciurus vulgaris</i>) is particularly threatened by grey squirrels, but to date there has been no clear pan to stem its population growth. A collaborative management framework that crosses administrative boundaries is required. Currently, the approach to grey squirrel management lacks coordination, focus and adequate funding.

The project focused on 15 sub-sites altogether covering approximately 40% of the total pSCI (as it was in 1999). These are situated in and around the Kielder Forest which is the largest man made forest in Northern Europe. They are also home to five annex I bird species, such as golden plover Pluvialis apricaria, golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos, and perigrine falcon falco peregrinus which will benefit substantially from the improvements to the quality of the habitat. \n\nIn the past, agricultural drainage and afforestation have encroached onto the blanket bogs and resulted in drying out and degradation of the habitat. However, one positive aspect of the proximity of the forest is that grazing animals have been excluded and burning has not been carried out for over 30 years so much so that the blanket mire has a naturalness that is almost unique in the UK.The project was run by a partnership of government and non-governmental bodies and most of the actions carried were non recurring. Thus, ditches were blocked to reinstate the integrity of the bogs' hydrological systems, trees were cut and removed on some 200ha to enlarge the blanket bog area and finally naturally regenerated trees were removed from open bog. Since the project was also be breaking new ground with mire rehabilitation on previously afforested areas, there was a lot of interest by both forestry and conservation organisations on the project's successes. Two workshops were organised to present the results of the project and to promote further networking both within the UK and in the rest of Europe.\n\nEU-LIFE co-financing provided a vital initial investment for the long term conservation of this unique site. Once the trees are removed and the ditches blocked the natural processes of peat formation will take over and, in time, the blanket bogs will become self sustaining.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=337", null, "life_237"]]}}}}
