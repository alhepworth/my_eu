The visit will enable her to discover more about the innovative educational practice of the preschools in Reggio, in particular their attitude to children's rights and responsibilities, citizenship and democracy. This learning will form the basis of an exciting project which will take place in school during January - March 2018. During the project children in school will be taking part in collaborative creative learning activities which will explore and develop their knowledge and understanding of rights, responsibilities, citizenship and democracy. Staff in the school will take part in ongoing professional development to support the project work. The children's and adults' learning will be written up and published as a booklet and film which will be available in July 2018. The project will feature on a dedicated page on the school's website and will also be featured on www.sightlines-initiative.com .The work of the project will be disseminated to the Rural Eden Cluster of 11 schools of which Kirkoswald C of E School is a part. The project is part of a wider school development programme aimed at promoting an innovative, exciting curriculum in which children learn creatively and collaboratively. It will enable teachers to become skilled at running long-term creative projects in their schools and will generate future learning and discussion in Cumbria and more widely. It will also strengthen the links between schools in Cumbria and other countries.", "http://kirkoswald.cumbria.sch.uk/", "Kirkoswald C of E School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036340_coordinator"]]}}, "2NR": {"life": {"data": [[1999, "Natura 2000 Rivers  - Safeguarding Natura 2000 Rivers in the UK", "English Nature", 1819483.0, 909741.0, "The conservation of river systems is a complex and challenging task.  They are subject to a wide range of manmade pressures, with the result that many associated habitats and species deemed to be of importance at a European level have declined across their natural range.  Yet, compared to other habitat systems, relatively little is known about the ecological dynamics and requirements of rivers and the species that live in them.  This project focused on 7 pSCI rivers in different parts of the UK, totalling around 872 km.  Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera. They also represent a typical cross section of the different land uses, socio-economic users and threats associated with rivers in the UK, and indeed in the rest of Europe.\n\nThis LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. \n\nFirst, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.  Ultimately, the project aimed to develop techniques for addressing key issues associated with river conservation and demonstrate best practice which could then be widely disseminated within the UK and other Member States.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=550", null, "life_158"]]}}}}
