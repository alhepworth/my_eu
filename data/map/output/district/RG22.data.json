One of the project's goals is to decrease global air pollution.\nThe wastes to be used for R&D of AC are the hemp residues from farming and industrial processing. They are a particularly suitable and novel raw material since hemp represents a sustainable crop with beneficial environmental characteristics not offered by other plants and it has many advantages for the preparation of AC mainly, large amounts of hemp residues are generated and its high carbon content.\nDifferent methods for the activation of the residues will be used for preparing AC with a suitable porous texture for gas and vapor phase pollutant abatement. There will be selected the most frequent and harmful VOC for the environment and with the greatest toxicity for Humans and Ecosystems. Adsorption tests will be carried out with the selected VOC, to determine the adsorption capacity of the AC towards those compounds, both in mixture or separately and, to evaluate the performance of the materials obtained.\nIn CARVOC the SMEs will benefit from the R&D conducted by the RTDs, because it will be obtained an ACF with improved structural and functional features to existing AC on the market since it will be produced from a new precursor, hemp fiber, and will be specifically activated for the purification of VOC.

Yet, current applications do not fully support intelligent processing and management of such information. Thus, users fail to access it efficiently and cannot exploit the underlying knowledge.<br/>The main objective of WeKnowIt is to develop novel techniques for exploiting multiple layers of intelligence from user-contributed content, which together constitute Collective Intelligence, a form of intelligence that emerges from the collaboration and competition among many individuals, and that seemingly has a mind of its own. To this end, input from various sources is analysed and combined: from digital content items and contextual information (Media Intelligence), massive user feedback (Mass Intelligence), and users social interaction (Social Intelligence) so as to benefit end-users (Personal Intelligence) and organizations (Organisational Intelligence).<br/>The automatic generation of Collective Intelligence constitutes a departure from traditional methods for information sharing, since for example, semantic analysis has to fuse information from both the content itself and the social context, while at the same time the social dynamics have to be taken into account. Such intelligence provides added-value to the available content and renders existing procedures and workflows more efficient.<br/>WeKnowIt will demonstrate the wide applicability of its achievements through the elaboration on two distinct case studies: an Emergency Response and a Consumers Social Group case study.

Our school has the task and mission to develop an intercultural teaching practice supported by innovative methods and entrepreneurship to achieve a more entrepreneurial learning for the benefits of our students. For some years now, we have run a number of international projects to develop our school and the training provided, and our experience is that it is a successful means to foster an international spirit to help make young people mobile and apt to actively seek a career or education in other European countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method to obtain the targets is to enable our teachers and students to develop their own learning as well as the learning of others through a greater intercultural understanding, improved lingusitic skills, stonger professional skills and an enhanced self-esteem. The international perspective provided by the project makes it possible to view oneself from a European perspective, which helps the individual to (also) take the step to work and live elsewhere in Europe. The participant teachers learn new methods to develop their teaching to make a greater number of students succeed in their learning. Thereby, our teaching staff help increase the students'  employability all over Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe add to our vocational students' opportunities by making them more attractive in their future work fields by making them develop entrepreneurial skills, their professional special skills as well as their cultural know-how and understanding.  We do this by developing the entrepreneurial learning by  focusing on ICT pedagogy, collaboration between education and enterprises (big and small in various fields of work), increased student influence and tutoring/mentoring as well as by by adding to their linguistic competences and sense of democarcy as a result of inclusion in an international environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this stage, sixteen of our teachers in vocational training will perform work shadowing and study how teachers in carefully chosen schools work with a strong development in the chosen fields of interest.  Our partners for work shadowing are Newton Abbot College, Tavistock College and South Devon College. In addition, a great number of our vocational students, 146 to be precise, will do work experience with numerous organisations and enterprises in England, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Poland.

The group is in charge of and responsible for selecting participants, communicating with partners, establishing various agreements/contracts, practicalities such as bookings, economy, evaluation and dissemination of the project results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy partaking in this project, we expect of participating teachers to develop their teaching practice to a more entrepreneurially featured kind that supplies the students with tools to succeed in their field of training.
