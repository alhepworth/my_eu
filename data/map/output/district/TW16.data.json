The carbon dioxide is produced at high pressure, reducing the compression energy for transport and storage. CACHET II project will develop innovative metallic membranes and modules for high capacity hydrogen production and separation from a number of fuel sources including natural gas and coal. The DICP membrane developed in FP6 project CACHET along with novel seal and substrate technology will be scaled up and undergo long term stability testing. An optimisation design tool will be built to include the relationship of all key operating parameters; this tool will be used to specify an optimised pilot and commercial membrane module design. The project will research novel binary and tertiary palladium alloys for improved durability and permeance for application to solid based fuels derived syngas and high temperature integrated reforming processes.

However the current materials are still lacking of separation performance and durability suitable for an efficient and economically feasible exploitation of such technology. \nThe Project NANOMEMC2 aims in overcoming the current limitation focusing on the development of innovative CO2 selective membranes with high flux and selectivity suitable for application to both Pre and Post-combustion Capture processes.\nTo that aim nanocomposite or mixed matrix membranes will be considered with particular focus on facilitated transport mechanisms promoted by carrier attached to the polymer or the filler. \nGraphene based nanosheets and cellulose nanofibres will be studied in detail considering their possible modification to improve polymer compatibility and affinity with CO2. \nA new generation of Facilitated Transport Mixed Matrix ( FTMM) membranes for CCS applications will be developed with increased CO2 flux and selectivity beyond the current target for industrial deployment of carbon capture membrane technologies", 151882.0, 4356400.0, 6, 12, "NanoMEMC2", null, "http://www.bp.com", null, "h2020_205824_995083910"], [1199145600000, 1325289600000, "CArbon-free Electricity by SEWGS: Advanced materials, Reactor and process design", "Bp Exploration Operating Company Ltd", "The proposed project CAESAR is building on work currently performed with the FP6 IP CACHET. One of the four pre combustion CO2 capture technologies that are being developed in CACHET is the Sorption Enhanced Water Gas Shift (SEWGS) process. The SEWGS process produces hot, high pressure H2 in a catalytic CO shift reactor with simultaneous adsorption of CO2 on a high temperature adsorbent. The system operates in a cyclic manner with steam for adsorbent regeneration.  The overall objective of proposed project CAESAR is the reduction of energy penalty and costs of the SEWGS CO2 capture process through optimization of sorbent materials, reactor- and process design. It is emphasized that with an optimized SEWGS process CO2 avoidance cost could be reduced to < \u20ac 15/ton CO2.    CAESAR takes into account the lessons learned in CACHET in order to bring the SEWGS process a big step closer to the market. To achieve this, CAESAR takes a necessary step back such that novel, more efficient CO2 sorbents with regeneration steam/CO2 ratios less 2 will be developed. This value is needed to bring the CO2 avoidance costs to about 15 \u20ac/ton. Heat integration and the use of sorbent coatings can further enhance the efficiency.    CAESAR will focus on the application of the optimized SEWGS process for pre combustion CO2 capture from natural gas. However the scope of application of SEWGS will be broadened to application in coal gas and industrial processes. A design for a pilot unit will be delivered for these applications.  There is a clear delimitation between CACHET and CAESAR. The emphasis in CACHET was placed on demonstrating the SEWGS process on a larger scale in a continuous, multi-bed SEWGS process demonstrator. CAESAR goes one step further in taking boundary conditions as to cost and efficiency into account.
