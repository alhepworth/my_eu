These areas tend to be of high economic value and are heavily used for a host of functions (e.g. fisheries, recreation, industry, etc.). Any of these uses may pose a threat to marine wildlife and habitats. The UK government has adopted legislation (UK Habitats Regulations) which provides for management schemes to be established for marine SACs, designed to make sure that any uses of the sites are compatible with the conservation needs of the habitats and species of European interest. \n\nThe project was to establish the first of these schemes on 12 sites around the UK and pave the way for others.\nThe selection of the 12 sites targeted by the project reflected the range of habitat types and species for which UK marine SACs had been proposed. Developing management schemes would involve collating information on the features of nature conservation interest, specifying conservation requirements and monitoring needs, and defining the factors (environmental and human activities) affecting site quality. At the end of the project, management schemes were to be established at the 12 selected marine sites. These would define the nature conservation interest of each site and what is required to ensure that the key features \u2013 such as bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay or Zostera habitats along the north Norfolk coast - are maintained, how to check for changes and how to respond if detrimental changes are detected.\n\nThe project would be operated by a consortium of the UK nature conservation agencies. Its key innovation was the partnership approach with main marine user interest groups and specialists, including port authorities, fisheries authorities, local and regional councils, scientific research institutes and recreational interest groups. \n\nThe experiences gained under this project should also be of benefit to other marine SACs in the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=81", "http://www.ukmarinesac.org.uk,", "life_80"]]}}, "5HA": {"life": {"data": [[2000, "Mink control - Mink control to protect important birds in SPAs in the Western Isles", "Scottish Natural Heritage", 2243124.0, 1121562.0, "The Western Isles of Scotland are of particularly high national and international nature conservation importance for their breeding populations of several species of wader and other water birds.

Formed by calcium rich sand being blown onto acidic soil, the habitat has been keenly influenced by land management practices among the traditional crofting and farming communities, with extensive grazing and low intensity crop rotations. The machair also supports a wide range of wading birds in extremely high densities [such as ringed plover (<i>Charadrius hiaticula</i>) and dunlin (<i>Calidris alpina schinzii</i>)], while also providing suitable habitat for a range of other Annex 1 Birds Directive migratory species (such as Corncrake [<i>Crex crex</i>] and chough [<i>Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax</i>]). In recent years there has been a shift towards more intensive agriculture, with greater use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, which threatens this unique habitat. The areas where machair is found are also facing problems with de-population with people leaving agriculture to seek employment opportunities away from the rural community.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3540", "http://www.machairlife.org.uk/,", "life_282"]]}}}}
