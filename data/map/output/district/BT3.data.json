The CRR will contain standardised summary data and analyses on an estimated 200,000 children with a CA born from 1995 to 2014 up to age 10, enabling hypotheses on their health and education to be investigated at an EU level. This enhanced information will allow optimisation of personalised care and treatment decisions for children with rare CAs. \nRegistries will be supported in using social media platforms to connect with families who live with CAs in their regions. A novel sustainable e-forum, \u201cConnectEpeople\u201d, will link these families with local, national and international registries and information resources. ConnectEpeople will involve these families in setting research priorities and ensuring a meaningful dissemination of results.\nFindings will provide evidence to inform national treatment guidelines, such as concerning screening programs, to optimise diagnosis, prevention and treatment for these children and reduce health inequalities in Europe.  An economic evaluation of the hospitalisation costs associated with CA will be provided. \nThe CRR and associated documentation, including linkage and standardisation procedures and \u201cConnectEpeople\u201d forum will be available post-EUROlinkCAT thus facilitating future local and EU level analyses.", 71835.0, 6406932.0, 13, 22, "EUROlinkCAT", null, null, null, "h2020_207442_938518166"], [1483228800000, 1561852800000, "Trillium Bridge II - Reinforcing the Bridges and Scaling up EU/US Cooperation on Patient Summary", "Connected Health Alliance Cic", "Trillium-II steps forward with an outstanding consortium to further advance global Electronic Health Record (EHR) interoperability.

These are the main objectives of JCV - Braga and are at the heart of all the work we carry out and volunteers will be given the opportunity to explore how these can be developed and built upon through the development of new ideas. The volunteers will be entrusted with the autonomy to utilise their skills, experiences and competencies to develop their own projects and ideas and make them a reality within the work of JCV - Braga. This is a key part of the project as we believe that allowing the participants to explore their ideas and develop them into something concrete can only improve JCV - Braga for the better whilst allowing them to develop their skills and competencies as they see fit, rather than constricting them to a predefined structure. Regular mentoring sessions and meetings with the project coordinator and other professionals within JCV - Braga, will allow the participants to help formulate ideas and see them put into action with all the support they require.\r\nThroughout the duration of the project we will use a non-formal education methodologies, allowing the volunteers to learn and develop through their creativity, original ideas and daily participation in the work undertaken at JCV - Braga.

The children and youths will feel an impact through contact with the volunteers, in a cultural and linguistic perspective and in the acquisition of competences. Finally, every professional, volunteer and beneficiary of activities involving the international volunteers, will expand their knowledge about the Erasmus+ programme, increase their cultural awareness, and conceptualise more creative processes through contact with them. This will also lead to more active participation by young people in their community and Europe.\r\nWhilst there are countless long-term benefits to this project in particular it will allow the young people to become more aware and tolerant towards cultural diversity.

The economic sectors most represented within the province are agriculture, construction and services. The industry is centered mostly in the forest wealth of the province (wood and resin). In addition, Cuenca has 1 Business Park and 3 Industrial Estates.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the City Council decided to promote this initiative is due to the worrying situation which the city finds itself in, due to unemployment which is currently made more urgent due the economic crisis which we are experiencing. Cuenca is facing a stage in which the migration rate has reached 28.8% since the crisis began. This has meant that the town council of Cuenca is ready to do everything in its power to help alleviate the discontented situation which the city is experiencing. One of these initiatives is through the CUENCA PLUS project, which supports the economic and social development of the municipality through quality education and training.\r\n\r\nAccording to studies conducted by their own City Council, the causes of unemployment and the subsequent migration of young people from the town are due to many factors including: the failure of the education system with a high dropout rate, inadequate employment policies, the existing widespread discontent in the town and the lack of expertise of young people. That is why the City Council has decided to give a boost to the educational system of the municipality, by reinforcing and supplementing it with periods of practical training in companies in other EU countries, which mean further improvement upon the current intermediate level training and training employment.\r\n\r\nThe town council of Cuenca has suggested to 3 local institutions the creation of a Consortium formed by the City Council of Cuenca, IES Pedro Mercedes, IES San Jos\u00e9 and CEOE CEPYME Cuenca to assist in the development of the CUENCA PLUS project.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at 25 young people at intermediate level who are pursuing their final year or who are undertaking a course of preparation for employment leading to a Certificate of Competence.

For this segment of the young population they consider the necessity of training focused on their specified difficulty, which in a year increases their employability and makes possible subsequent rapid entry into the workforce.\r\n\r\nFor the achievement of these objectives, the ALEF will work with 4 intermediary partners (EUROYOUTH (Lisbon, PT), AMADEUS (Vienna, AT), INTERN EUROPE (Belfast, UK), EPPAS (Prague, CZ), which will support the development of the activities of ODISEO 2015 during the stays of the participants abroad. These partners will facilitate the socio-cultural and work integration of the participants, they will collaborate in questions of logistics during the stays, and they will support ALEF in the monitoring and the evaluation of the project.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, with the objective of immediate entry into the workforce of the participants upon their return, ALEF counts on the support of the network of collaborative businesses, some of which are included in the project as local intermediary partners. \r\n\r\nAll of the businesses are located in the local area and are characterised by their high level of marketing and international projection. This network develops their work in the coordinated planning of active policies of employment, training, qualification, intermediation and entry into the workforce of participants in the programs managed by the Agency.
