The prevalence of these disorders is 2-16% of the general population. Children with SEBD, diagnosed or not, are likely to live in social isolation, to receive a poor education, and they risk becoming deviant teenagers, or unemployed adults. Teachers and staff with responsibility for behavioral matters in school are often alone in the management of these difficulties, and poorly prepared for dealing complicated educational challenges. The bad management of the SEBD provokes further costs for the health system and, more in general, for the whole society.\r\nA way to approach SEBD with consistent level of educational success is to equip teachers with proper training on practical and proven classroom management strategies that can help them to effectively control difficult behaviours with confidence and competence. \r\nThe BEHAVE project aims exactly to reinforce and enlarge networks and to promote a transnational culture about some of the most effective strategies to approach SEBDs in classroom. To pursue this aim the project provides a set of tools to empower teacher\u2019s professional profile also enhancing the sharing of evidence and knowledge. The BEHAVE target are teachers of primary schools who are daily involved in the fight to guarantee SEBD students a better quality of life. The estimated number of both direct and indirect participants is about 650 among teachers in training (about 500) and stakeholders.\r\nMore in depth, the project carry out the following activities:\r\n- The adaptation of the WHAAM application developed in a previous LLL European project. Currently, this application offers an ICT-based solution supporting the observation of ADHD behaviours in order to better comprehend their meaning and plan appropriate, well-timed, and statistically consistent interventions. The BEHAVE intends to add new features to the WHAAM app in order to widen its scope and make it available for other psychological disorders.\r\n- The development of a Behavior Management Hub (BMH) to sustain a community of teachers and experts that tackle daily behavioral problems at schools. It collects also relevant materials and educational resources adaptable to both formal and informal learning, contributing to the lifelong learning of teachers and everyone who is a motivated user. The hub represent also the main tool to sustain the establishment of a community of practice interested in the topics of the project.\r\n- The design and delivery of 5 three-day specialization courses about the most popular and effective models of behavioral management across Europe for the benefit of primary schools\u2019 teachers. The courses will take place in each partner country (IT, UK, PT, RO, BE).\r\n- The implementation of the BEHAVE survey to investigate how the government of the nations involved in the project address the behavior management at school.\r\n- The organization of 4 multiplier events, some devoted to verify the coherence between project objectives and outputs, other to disseminate the results and increase the expected impact. \r\nA consistent project management methodology will be set up to carry out the project. This methodology is aimed at translating all the project workflow in appropriate, professional, repeatable, standardized, and documented collection of processes, tools, technique and templates. \r\nGenerally, we expect to make a direct impact, both at local and transnational level, mainly on Children with Social Emotional and Behavioral Difficulties (SEBD), teachers and educational staff, partner organizations and other stakeholders. To obtain the envisaged impact a combination of tangible and intangible project results will be achieved: primarily in enhancing intrinsic teachers experience and expertise in managing SEBD, promoting the development of professional networks, increasing compliance and trust among educational and health professionals, building skilled community of practices. All these results are linked to a smart application of ICTs to boost and promote new practices and approaches in the Evidence Based Education.\r\nThe BEHAVE project have also long-term benefits. It, in fact, can represent an important reference point for orienting policies and intervention in the sector of the education for special needs. Coherently with the strategic objectives in the ET 2020 framework, the project promote equity, social cohesion and active citizenship, for children and adolescents with SEBD, and for their caregivers.

We are extremely proud of our diverse School community and celebrate our pupils differences as well as explicitly identifying ways in which we are similar.    \r\nThis project fits with our EDP, which also feeds into our SIP.  We have identified that we need to improve the provision for new arrivals to make sure they settle in to School quickly, work at an appropriate level and make rapid progress. \r\nWe identified in our European Development Plan 4 areas of need which we will address through this project.We expect improvements will be made in all of these areas.\r\n\r\n1. Developing knowledge and understanding of the CLIL approach which all the bilingual schools in Madrid use.\r\nWe want to learn from our Spanish link school as they use the CLIL approach, using English as a second language to teach.Through structured training courses, we will learn the theory behind language acquisition, how pupils are supported to develop their language skills using CLIL as well as observe practical demonstrations in lessons. As a significant percentage of pupils speak English as an additional language in our School, CLIL would be an approach which we could adopt to promote rapid progress for pupils who are using English as a second language to learn.\r\n\r\n2.  Enhancing the language skills of staff and their cultural awareness through immersion in the mobilities. \r\nAll staff involved in the mobilities will improve their language competence, measured by the use of the Europass Language Passport as a baseline, end of year 1 and an end-of-project assessment. The enhanced cultural awareness will be measured through the completion of the course tasks/project assessments monitored by the IWP.The outcomes in terms of attainment for pupils will be measured through the twice-yearly assessments against our Key Performance Indicators and through pupil surveys to assess attitude and motivation.  This should up-skill our staffs language skills and enrich curriculum delivery.   \r\n\r\n3. Providing a Culturally Inclusive Curriculum, Celebrating Diversity\r\n- Using the link with a partner school to enhance the learning about the Spanish language, culture and history.  \r\nWe will have embedded the partnership into the life of the school so the link will be sustainable. We will have a planned programme of exchanging project work both physically and electronically.This will necessitate a development of our ICT skills -we will use Skype to exchange ideas and materials with our link school. In addition,we plan to produce podcasts and experiment with the use of twitter. We will use the eTwinning platform as our secure space to post and share work and discussions. Records will be kept of all these activities and the quality of the early examples will be compared with the later ones to assess progress. \r\nCross curricular implementation-we will explore the Islamic tradition and history of Spain as part of our inclusive curriculum. Subject Leads who participate in the mobilities will be required to produce Units of Work in their curriculum area which integrate elements of Spanish Art, History & Geography.This will be monitored by the Working Party.\r\n\r\n4. European and International Dimension - by the end of the two year project our school will have achieved the Full Accreditation of the International School Award. This will follow a complete audit of the curriculum and the introduction of elements into each curriculum area. The link with our partner school in Spain will be an source of knowledge and inspiration as to new ways of thinking.\r\n\r\nWe know that our objectives are ambitious but we have a clear view of what we want the outcomes of the project to be.\r\nSome of the outcomes, such as the development of management competences, will be developed through the project and monitored by the SLT through our evaluative process.\r\nWe wish as many of our staff as possible to use this CPD opportunity. We have,therefore,requested a two year project during which 12 members of staff (teachers and teaching assistants)have the opportunity to take part in mobilities. We know that in order to have a major impact on the life of the school, we need to have a whole school approach and all staff need to share this vision and understand the role they play. However, in order to maximise the participants' ability to reflect on practice observed whilst on the course, we are suggesting that just 3 at a time take part in the mobility so that staff are able to focus on the strategies used by the Spanish teachers.\r\nWe consider that these elements of the curriculum which teach pupils to be open minded and curious about places and people across Europe and Internationally are life skills that are essential for our pupils to develop in order to for them to be considerate, tolerant and good citizens.", "http://www.parkfieldschool.com", "Parkfield Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036286_coordinator"]]}}, "4AX": {"cordis": {"data": [[1504224000000, 1661904000000, "Effects of Nutrition and Lifestyle on Impulsive, Compulsive, and Externalizing behaviours", "Add Information Services", "Maladaptive impulsivity and compulsivity predispose to antisocial and addictive behaviours.

Although respiratory support, especially mechanical ventilation, can improve their survival, it also causes severe injury to the vulnerable lung resulting in severe and chronic pulmonary morbidity lasting in to adulthood. Heterogeneity of lung aeration, resulting in areas of lung over inflation and lung collapse, plays a crucial part in the risk of mortality and morbidity due to respiratory failure.  This distribution of lung aeration cannot be detected by currently available bedside monitoring tools and imaging methods. Thus, an imaging technique for continuous non-invasive bedside monitoring of infants lung function is urgently needed.

In European (a.o. the Flood Risk Directive) and in national and regional policies, attempts are made to diversify and align different Flood Risk Strategies (FRSs). In our proposal, five such strategies are distinguished: risk prevention; flood defense; mitigation; preparation; and recovery. We assume that vulnerable urban agglomerations will be more resilient if multiple FRSs are applied simultaneously, linked together and aligned. At the same time, the application of a diverse cluster of FRSs has to be appropriate, i.e. attuned to the physical and social context. The latter asks for innovative Flood Risk Governance Arrangements (FRGAs).

The target group (over 55 years and not digitally literate) typically consists of individuals who have reached an advanced stage in their lives without learning to use any digital technology. Our approach will use touch-table games to introduce such individuals to digital interaction that provides confidence motivation and skills that can subsequently support exploratory-based learning of other digital technologies.  The approach will be to pilot and validate a new approach to learning digital skills that targets affective barriers to technology adoption as well as the cognitive and physical process of learning and skill acquisition.  Progression from initial exploration of a table-top application through the practical comprehension of system principles  to automatic competence and full literacy can be achieved through a combination of playful exploration and light guidance through engagement with games.   Players motivated to engage with games are effectively engaging in incremental learning about, for example, the behaviour of digital objects, the principles of object and area selection and the relationship between analogue metaphors and degrees of movement on digital space.  Helping and persuading participants to overcome reluctance is a priority as facilitating the cognitive progress of learning, and the playability, engagement and sociality of games is key to this strategy.    The use of the social dimension weakens resistance to educational activities that learners may be reluctant to engage in.  For older users this includes reversing a social stigma when contemplating digital technologies (where there is a sense of disenfranchisement, a sense that it is not \u2018their\u2019 technology).  The overlay of a sense of social activity through gaming is likely to produce behaviour change.  The mission of organisations such as The  UK and numerous regional online centres in the UK is to provide an environment that supports a positive approach to technology, as well as more instrumental help in overcoming difficulties.A threshold of 210 users and 35 individuals engaged in mentoring users in day centre environments will take part in two round of studies using touch-table games, followed by longitudinal monitoring of their progression to use of a wider range of digital utilities, principally using tablets. This will lead to the generation of a best-practice guide for promoting the approach to inspiring digital adoption for older users. This will disseminated in the three partner countries and trans-nationally through organizations concerned with promoting digital adoption for excluded citizens.The EU acknowledges the need for every citizen to have at least basic digital skills in order to participate in the modern society. Although the percentage of people online has increased rapidly in recent years we are now faced with the fact that there remains a percentage of people who for a combination of reasons are harder to reach and more difficult to provide with digital skills. Acquiring initial digital literacy involves learning basic manipulations, translating thoughts and intentions into specific input actions.  This is a skill that is learned through adoption, exploration and repeated practice.  The WIMP interfaces that are typical of the second generation of interactive systems have proved difficult to learn for many citizens.  Therefore our approach is to provide pathways to digital literacy that has playful and social interaction as a key first phase.  The gentle introduction gradually encourages exploratory learning of tools such as social network and communication, and more task-based applications such as e-mail, form filling and manipulating security features.  This may be by transferring learned and practiced competence not interaction with tablets (in order to exploit touch and manipulation skill acquired through game play).   This segmentation of the learning process allows the acquisition of key interaction and exploratory-learning skills based on ludic engagement. This will build up digital confidence and familiarity with touch interfaces, and removes the stigma associated with digital technology, using ludic engagement to positively reinforce familiarity and confidence the technology.  Furthermore it helps to redefine the role of those who are charged with mentoring and helping those individuals, by redefining the nature of learning.  It is anticipated that the work will disseminate best-practice through its relationships with practitioner organizations established at EU level and in three of the partner countries (UK, Austria, Slovenia) where organizations targeting wider digital participation already exist.

It will  also substantiate the value and enhance their impact on the creative industries and even beyond.  In recent years there has been a rich reconsideration of the place of creative arts practice in research, addressing how practice can be understood as a method of research and how embodied arts and material thinking produces knowledge.  There has also been a growing number of doctorates completed through creative practice (which is variously called 'Artistic Research', 'Arts-based Research', 'Practice led Research'). However, dance and somatically informed performance, as a minority subject in many Universities, has received little direct attention in these discourses and frameworks and researchers in this field often work in isolating contexts with somewhat meagre infrastructure, networks, resources and channels to disseminate and support the work done.      ADiE seeks to address this gap by investigating practices and developing resources to support the significant developments in dance research that have the potential to reach beyond university frameworks to impact artistic innovation and the creative economy.The principal aim is to develop productive and meaningful provisions for PaR Doctorates that are suitable to the fluid, increasingly interdisciplinary and global, creative/research environments with which they intersect. Addressing the needs of research candidates, supervisors, universities and the creative industry the aim is to develop resources and guidelines that are directly relevant to the mobile nature of the creative industry and recognise the changing needs of the professional dance and performing arts sector. ADiE will therefore ensure that the rising number of artists entering into, and being nurtured by,  university environments receive the best possible support for their artistic/scholarly endeavors and are also well prepared to become our future leaders in the arts. ADiE asks: What are the expectations, perceptions and experiences of the Artistic Doctorate?What are the methodological tools and other training needs of artistic researchers in Dance and Performance?How are doctoral dissertations in artistic research best supervised and supported?How do doctoral studies through artistic research respond to, and prepare candidates for, the future?How might universities and creative partners better support artistic research doctorates and reflect the future needs of the creative industry and higher  education environments?  To address these questions ADiE will undertake four strands of work:1. Review the experiences/expectations of artistic doctoral candidates in different national contexts to identify best practices and gaps/ issues.2. Devise open educational resources / research training materials focusing in depth upon methodologies for artistic research in the public realm. 3. Develop guidelines that enable university & collaborative partners to better supervise and support the life cycle of Artistic Doctorates4.

Three experts,  all authorities in the field of nurse education, from three different continents - Australia, Africa, Asia- will contribute to the project as consultant/ advisors, thus enabling  a wide comprehensive universal relevance of the simulation kit. The project, its results, and intellectual outputs will be widely disseminated through various channels and networks of each and every partner.  In addition, the project will develop and provide (deliver) an innovative appropriate and adequate training opportunity to two individuals from each of the ten participating partners, towards becoming \"Simulation Champions\", at a respective partner institution.  The introduction of such training and the development and designation of such champions, is believed to hold the key towards the further development, and increased use of simulation, at the partner institutions. This training course will provide a  direct opportunity to extend and develop nurse educators' competence. Information seminars and a conference meeting will serve the purpose of heightening the awareness and the knowledge of educators, students, and relevant stakeholders regarding the use of simulation in teaching and learning.  The result and outputs of the project should enhance students' learning , which may in turn translate into enhanced patent care delivery and thus, improved patients' experience and satisfaction.  This is the eventual all important goal of the project. The planned dissemination processes will hopefully translate into a widespread knowledge regarding the project. Every partner is tasked with the organisation or co-ordination of at least one output, event, or activity ensuring  reasonable distribution of work and budgets and enabling maximal collaboration across the partners. The applicant partner will oversee the entire project against the support of UEPA (Malta) and respective relevant structures within the University of Malta.", "http://www.mdx.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-MT01-KA203-015210_1"], [2014, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 252060.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.mdx.ac.uk", "MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000222_coordinator"], [2018, "Internationalisierung an der Deutschen Meisterschule f\u00fcr Mode / Designschule M\u00fcnchen", "MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 242035.0, 5, 6, "The Deutsche Meisterschule f\u00fcr Mode / Designschule M\u00fcnchen maintains an international network for many years.

We know very little about how compassion is taught in the classroom, even less on how its learning is facilitated in practice, and nothing about how this is measured.\r\n\r\n2. Although all humans have the capacity to be compassionate, how this is demonstrated and understood varies between individuals and between cultural groups.\r\n\r\n3. Compassionate leaders make the best role models for nurses and other healthcare professionals in practice, who in their turn become compassionate role models to students.\r\n\r\n4. Compassionate care, leads to higher levels of patient/family satisfaction.\r\n\r\n5. Higher levels of satisfaction contribute to faster more effective healing, with higher levels of compliance and lower costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project aims to improve the quality of training for nurses and health care professionals in the  delivery of compassionate and cultural competent  care which  responds  to the healthcare sector needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives: \r\n\r\n1. Systematically review empirical literature pertaining to universal components of compassion, as well as the measurement and practice of compassion;\r\n\r\n2. Construct, pilot and implement a self assessment \u2018compassion measuring tool\u2019 (CMT);\r\n\r\n3. Design new training and work based learning model, for the development of compassion skills of  nurses and health care professionals based on an analysis of their needs;  \r\n\r\n4. Develop an intervention which will promote the learning, practice and support of compassion-in-practice; this will begin with the development of nursing and healthcare leaders;\r\n\r\n5. Evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on service providers and users;\r\n\r\n6. Make all project tools freely available on a dedicated website;\r\n\r\n7. Hold an international conference;\r\n\r\n8. Establish a network of people working on \u2018compassion\u2019 projects for knowledge share and co-creation of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstitutions from seven countries will participate in this project: a) Middlesex University London, UK (co-ordinator), b) Edunet, Romania, c)Cyprus University of Technology, Cyprus, d) Marmara University Pendik Research and Training Hospital, e) Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Italy, f) University College Lillebaelt, Denmark, g) Universitat De Valencia, Spain. The partnership is a mixture of universities, VET institutions and hospital services \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will begin with a rigorous review of the literature around culturally competent compassion (theoretical and practical learning and measuring of it). The first stage will be followed by an analysis of the learning needs of those working in leadership positions in nursing and at least two other healthcare professions. The results of stages 1 & 2 will be used to develop the Delphi studies (to design a uniquely innovative measuring tool and an European model for the development of role models to promote and support culturally competent and compassionate care). Once the outputs of the Delphi studies are finalised the curriculum for the healthcare leaders as well as the learning tools for their educational intervention will be piloted and finalised. The intervention will address the critical role of senior managers and practitioners in setting values, expectations and behaviours which promote and support culturally competent compassionate care. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother innovation of this project is the adoption of the open educational resources (OER) approach to provide new learning opportunities which will be embedded in the online training platform and   will support individuals to upgrade their existing skills, knowledge and experience as well as gaining new ones. Further, the proposed knowledge exchange network will bring together healthcare professionals from across Europe and possibly beyond, in order to share good practices and co-create knowledge tools during the project\u2019s life and after the projects ends thus assuring its sustainability and long-term impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results of the project will be disseminated during national/local seminars and a European conference. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the long term, we believe that healthcare practitioners and service providers across Europe will benefit through accessing the project\u2019s OERs.This project will impact on all five points outlined in the first section of this summary..", "http://www.mdx.ac.uk", "MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA202-001659_coordinator"], [2015, "Training health care teams in intercultural communication and patient safety", "MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 213487.0, 5, 5, "The   \u201cTraining health care teams in intercultural communication and patient safety\u201d  project addresses the complex issue of patient safety, failure of which results in millions of patient safety incidents each year, with severe consequences and unnecessary suffering for patients and their families as well as millions of public Euros in compensation. \r\n\r\nThe project is a continuation of the other four projects carried out under the \u201cIntercultural Education of Nurses in Europe\u201d (IENE) topic initiative, which started in 2008 (www.ieneproject.eu).  \r\n\r\nIn order to match their skills to the  competences demanded for safe patient care, this IENE5 project address the link between the levels of intercultural communication within members of MMHTs and patient safety and aims to increase the knowledge and skills of members of healthcare teams, in three major areas: Intercultural communication, Working in multicultural teams and Patient safety. \r\n\r\nPartners from five European countries,  Universities (Middlesex University of London, UK , University College Lillebaelt, Denmark, Cyprus University of Technology, Nursing  School Edunet, Romania    and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Italy bring relevant and complementary skills and human resources  to create an innovative  European Training Model,  aiming to promote knowledge and skills of  intercultural communication, working in MMHTs and patient safety and develop training content,  learning and evaluation  tools,  which will be available on the project  website.\r\n\r\nThe partners will  build a highly interactive and based on co-learning and co-creation MOOC (Massive Open On-line Course), containing learning and self-assessment activities and tools. After training 50 facilitators from the participating countries to support and guide the  learners\u2019 communities on the MOOC, 150 participants from the project\u2019s partner countries and approximately 500 nurses and health care professionals from across the world will be recruited to  participate in the  training on  the created MOOC.\r\n\r\nTo  promote the  intercultural communication culture and patient safety values,  six  national seminars, will be organized in the  partners\u2019 countries  attended by  the managers,  training providers and potential users,  who  will learn about the created resources and  how   to  use and the MOOC. \r\n\r\nIn carrying out the project, the pedagogical approaches we will  use is  innovative and learner-centered,  based on digital integration in learning.

Critics consider use as a threat to heritage, leading to commercialization, exploitation and destruction. The view, however, that heritage preservation occurs when heritage elements are in actual use, thus generating revenue to sustain preservation is gaining momentum. Further, there are arguments that many if not most of the benefits derived from cultural heritage are realized only in the course of actual use. Economic science has recently developed pertinent tools and concepts, initially used for environmental goods and services that are suitable in assessing the economic value of Cultural Heritage and help realizing its development potential and at the same time supporting preservation.\r\n\r\nObjectives.\r\nThe Strategic objectives of the project are to promote public awareness for the sustainable development potential of cultural heritage and to establish social initiatives building new entrepreneurial partnerships investing on local and regional cultural heritage. These objectives are in line with the transversal policy priorities for education, training and youth, as defined by Europe 2020 for building a \"smart, sustainable and inclusive economy.\" This overall concern is addressed by means of the sustainable, social-economical and environmental, positive effect of cultural heritage; a field entailing a dynamic potential touching all the aforementioned factors and highlighting a transnational common ground. \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants.\r\nThe project aims to directly reach 2200 people who will be directly involved in four countries through seven partners and a series of activities. However, the project objective is to reach a high multiple of this number indirectly because it is investing on rising public awareness on the dynamic potential of cultural heritage for sustainable development. In that sense, the indirect benefit of the wider public, apart from the people participating in its activities, is inherent in the project logic. Throughout the project's implementation a series of occasions for contact with a wider audience and set of interlocutors exist. \r\n\r\nDescription of activities. \r\nProject activities include creating a platform as an interactive tool for information and communication, surveying international good practices, developing material that will be useful for training individuals in cultural heritage in general and related social entrepreneurship initiatives in specific, customising the pedagogical material by allowing its adaptivity to different local contexts, organising seminars and hands-on workshops, together with open lectures and on-line videos for deepening as well as disseminating project outputs.  At the same time some project activities are more tailor-made for the entrepreneurial audience, administrative authorities and consumers at local level, while others target the academic community.  \r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project.  \r\nThe main issue that this project addresses is a change in thinking of stakeholders on how they approach cultural heritage. For achieving project objectives, the project will start with a survey of best practices at global level of cultural heritage based sustainable development and of how opportunities and barriers were addressed.  Subsequently, project partners will apply this knowledge to survey the local context in three case studies. These case studies will be investigated using thematic analysis for opportunities and barriers of using cultural capital for growth and sustainable development. On the basis of the results of the case studies project partners will develop educational material for skill development, entrepreneurship strategies, institutional initiatives and public awareness. The resulting integrated framework of practice for a cultural heritage based sustainable development model will be the major output of the project and will be disseminated across the EU.\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits.  \r\nThe project provides a paradigm at the European level.  It will raise awareness about the development potential of cultural heritage and will equip stakeholders with knowledge on how to weigh the different values and trade-offs between conservation and development. Furthermore, the project will help local and regional authorities to introduce incentives that are essential for achieving integrated conservation. Finally, the project is expected to enhance the combination of public and private investment to promote both, economic development and heritage preservation. The project is expected to have a substantial development impact on local and regional economies, responsible institutions and communities, demonstrating that culture can and should play a major role in development programmes.", "http://www.mdx.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-EL01-KA204-014085_4"], [2014, "ROMtels - Interactive dual language immersive learning space", "MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 200111.0, 4, 6, "This project arises from two long-standing, global and well documented educational challenges: firstly Eastern European Traveller, including Roma pupils' poor participation and persistently low achievement in education, and secondly the decline of home language use in primary classrooms (age 5-11) as a pedagogic tool to raise the academic achievement of pupils whose home language(s) differs from the official language of schools. The project\u2019s response to these challenges will begin in UK with the development of an innovative integration of two technologies working in tandem (digital table and large scale 360 degree projected displays) to act as a medium through which pupils can experience high quality dual language learning. Accompanying software will incorporate sound files in pupils\u2019 home languages alongside English, and pupils will be encouraged to communicate in whichever language supports their activity, i.e. their home language or the language of the school or a mixture of both. The activities operating through this technology will be enquiries (problems or puzzles) coherent with schools\u2019 curriculum subject knowledge requirements, and which will therefore demand purposeful language use.  The objective is to improve the Eastern European pupils\u2019 motivation and engagement towards institutionalised school activity, at the same time as improving their proficiency in using cognitive academic language for learning in both their home language and English. Collaboration with parents, and the transformation of teachers\u2019 attitudes towards Traveller communities is an integral part of the project so that children\u2019s cultural and linguistic backgrounds are made available to schools by parents who trust this information is respected, valorised and used by teachers to improve the educational and social inclusion of their children. At the same time families become more knowledgeable about institutionalised education.  \r\n\r\nThe results of developments in UK and the lessons learned will act as a springboard for work in phase two to promote a dual language pedagogic approach in France, Finland and Romania, appropriate to the needs of their children and context. The project is therefore iterative in its responsiveness to lessons learned from one context applied sensitively to another. \r\nTo achieve this, partners from 4 European countries will work together. The coordinator of the project (at Newcastle University, UK) is an expert in the field of teacher education in equality and diversity who has close collaborative links with local schools including WestgateHill Primary School where over 90% of pupils speak English as an additional language, and where the dual language immersive space will be created by the technology for the benefit of local Eastern European Traveller pupils, including Roma in the first instance. The project also benefits from two other Newcastle University participants who provide expertise in enquiry-based learning, and in interaction design. The co-coordinator of the project (at Middlesex University, UK) is another expert in teacher education and collaboration with multilingual communities. The UK participants are joined by a professor of multiculturalism (at Helsinki University) an expert on funded European projects that focus on equality who coordinates a team of two other Helsinki University participants whose expertise includes the development and promotion of bilingual pedagogies in Finnish schools and video and linguistic analyses. A professor of education (at Institut Catholique de Paris) in France where a large number of Romanian migrants have settled in recent years is the French partner. The Finnish and French participants will identify collaborative school partners where similar technologies will be used during the project. Finally, the project has a Romanian partner who is president of the people-to-people foundation, who built and runs a thriving school for Roma children in Oradea, Romania. \r\n\r\nThrough wide-scale dissemination of all outputs from the project, the long term aim is to effect practice changes in the inclusion and education of Eastern European Traveller including Roma pupils across Europe in order to positively impact on increased school attendance and improved educational achievement. We expect the project to lead to greater teacher understanding and responsiveness to cultural and linguistic diversity, with improved competency specifically in teaching pupils from Eastern European Traveller including Roma groups. For parents we aim for the project to contribute towards an improved understanding of the cultural values and practices of institutionalised education in the partner countries. Taken together, the intended impacts on pupils, their parents and schools, could have substantial  longer term impacts on the inclusion of and more active participation of Eastern European Traveller communities in society in each partner country, contributing towards greater social cohesion.", "http://www.mdx.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000022_3"], [2015, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 195792.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

Numerous driving forces to this change include rapidly expanding marketplace (globalization), and increasing competition, diversity among consumers, and availability of new forms of teaching technology, methodology and approaches. In this environment, competitiveness at company level depends crucially on the speed with which new products can be brought to the market and new cost-saving improvements made. Innovation - the ability to reap the rewards of scientific achievement - requires much more than the ability to turn a new idea into a working product. It requires the systematic and holistic approach of innovation management. \r\n\r\nFrom another point of view, education is on the dynamic path of change and modernisation. New innovative cross-functional and cross-disciplinary approach, engaging business, external stakeholders, the public, researchers and other third parties is essential. The Europe 2020 strategy, its Flagship Initiatives and the Modernisation Agenda of European universities put knowledge at the heart of the Union\u2019s efforts for achieving smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Including practical experience in courses can help attune curricula to current and emerging labour market needs and foster employability and entrepreneurship (Agenda for the modernisation of Europe's higher education systems, 2011 ). \r\n\r\n2) Main aims and objectives of the project\r\n\r\n\u2022 To provide pedagogical methodology and course plan for obtaining competences, skills and knowledge in IM.\r\n\r\n\u2022 To provide European HEIs, researchers, experts and SME managers with fully documented training materials and tools in innovation management.\r\n\r\n\u2022 To increase the competitiveness and the innovation capacity by providing SMEs with the necessary IM tools and practices for their everyday activities. \r\n\r\n\u2022 To increase the European business and training community awareness and to cultivate a common consciousness about innovation management.\r\n\r\n\u2022 To increase the intensity and quality of business-academia collaboration by providing a ready-to-implement model.\r\n\r\n3) Number and profile of participants\r\n\r\nThe APInno proposal has a balanced partnership structure and includes two HEIs, two SMEs, one Research Centre and one NGO active in HEI-business collaboration and adult training.

These products will help both HEIs and SMEs to develop new practices to systematically manage their potential for innovation. Managers of SMEs and other organizations will be able to identify, value, select the best means to develop, trigger and share their most valuable asset: creativity. HEIs will have a model for experiential learning approach in IM. Despite the widespread recognition of the need of innovation, practical guidance and systematic approaches to managing innovation  are still not available in an integrated training framework.

As the population of Europe is ageing, more and more older people are in need of care and support. This will include older LGBT people, who often need more professional care and support as many do not have children. Research  has demonstrated that older LGBT people experience social exclusion while interacting with care providers and that their life stories and relationships are overlooked and undervalued [NOF 2014,  Higgins et al 2011, Almack et al 2010;].  In some cases they experience direct discrimination within health and social care environments.  \r\nCurrent curricula in educational institutions pay little or no attention to sexual and gender diversity among older people [Hafford-Letchfield 2010]. Hence health and social care educators can exacerbate the problem by perpetuating heteronormative assumptions and ignoring LGBT identities in education. Consequently health and social care workers go on to neglect the importance of sexual identity, sexual orientation, sexual health and gender in their assessment and care [Cocker and Hafford-Letchfield, 2010]. Research indicates that aged care environments perpetuate exclusion of LGBT people through advertising and policies that assume heterosexuality (Phillips and Marks 2008). Therefore to raise awareness and acceptation of LGBT older people it is important to include sexual and gender diversity in the education of our future health and social care staff. \r\nThis project aims to promote and support the social inclusion of LGBT older people in receipt of care through positive interaction with educational institutions that prepare future professionals to work with older people. By exchanging good practices, including  teaching and learning materials and by developing educational resources and pedagogies, we aim to improve the knowledge and competencies of future care professionals in the area of LGBT affirmative practices.

Enthusiasm immanent to young people, in combination with new competences, mentorship and guidance will have a priceless impact on the development of their future careers. They will be able to instantly apply in their project what they learned directly from classes. International and multicultural environment will also create positive attitudes towards internationalisation of their business ideas. \r\nHabitual reliance on traditional sources of education, both of students and young entrepreneurs, with this contemporary educational source, will be shifted to more open minded and self-motivated search for other open educational resources upon their needs.\r\nParticipating institutions will have derived benefits in several aspects. Besides the impacts on existing curriculums, greater transparency and recognition of programmes, universities as higher education and research institutions will encourage their young researchers to use this open academy, especially the researchers without any entrepreneurial knowledge. Furthermore, participating organisations will also benefit in the quality of education and educational practice, enriching their teaching methods and widening the possibilities in combining classic classroom and virtual lectures offering more space to additional learning outcomes.", "http://www.mdx.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-HR01-KA203-013080_2"], [2016, "Contemporary large migration waves into Europe: Enabling health workers to provide psychological support to migrants and refugees and develop strategies for dealing with their own emotional needs.", "MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 157329.0, 6, 6, "Context/background of project:By end of 2014, 59.5 million individuals were forcibly displaced worldwide as a result of persecution, conflict, generalized violence, or human rights violations. In 2015 more than 1,000,000 people arrived in Europe by sea and land.  In the same year more than 3,000 migrants and refugees died at sea whilst trying to reach Europe.  The numbers of people rescued at sea have been increasing dramatically on a daily basis, with around 6,771 people rescued within two days in May 2015. During the first two months of 2016 more than 100,000 migrants arrived in Europe. This proposal focuses on developing a knowledge hub (KHub) for nurses and other health professionals and volunteers who are dealing with or will be dealing with migrants and refugees from the current massive waves of displaced people which are reaching Europe and who are experiencing massive traumas and tragedies in their endeavours to flee to a safe and 'better' place for themselves and their families.

Objectives of your project::This KHub aims to:a) develop the health workers\u2019 competencies in providing emotional/psychological support in culturally competent and compassionate ways, to individuals who are part of the new waves of migration primarily from Syria, Irag and Afganistan who arrive in Greece through Turkey.  b) helpi health workers and volunteers to develop personal/peer strategies to cope with the high levels of their own personal traumas as a result of what they encounter whilst doing their job. c) develop resources on open access for health workers, undergraduate and post graduate students who can use for research projects, and other learning related to the emotional/psychological needs of migrants, refugees, health workers in the front line of service provision. d) create a network, a place where members of various communities can come together to discuss, comment, brainstorm, share views and good practices, share experiences, innovate, create, connect and collaborate.Number and profile of participants:It is difficult to estimate the number of participants since the outputs of this project will be open access on line resources and  learning. But we estimate that during the lifetime of the project the numbers of migrant visits to the KHub will be between 500 -5000, the health workers and volunteer visits will be 200-1000. Description of activities: The creation of an exciting user friendly KHub platform. The production of materials presenting the Facts, Figures, Policies & Legislation and syntheses of literature, media reports & commentaries related to the current waves of migrants into Europe. The production of personal and reconstructive narratives about health workers, volunteers and migrant lived in experiences. The identification of psychological support tools and best practices. The creation of interactive tools to aid the acquisition of skills in providing emotional support. The delivery of workshops, webinars, social media discussions etc with the participation of migrants, health workers and crowd sourced experts. The provision of KHub space and tools for networking and blogging. The provision of training on how to navigate and make the most of the KHub. Six National valorisation seminars.Methodology to be used in carrying out the project::The methodology will be based on the principles of co-creation and co-learning. The outputs will be created through a combination of bottom up and top down approaches. Short description of the results and impact envisaged:The results will be numerous tools prepared by the target groups and members of the project team and presented in user friendly easily accessible ways which will help the target groups to provide emotional support to peers and to themselves. Since massive migration will continue and because the KHub tools, other resources and networking facilities will be accessible through mobile devices we envisage the impact to be large and long lasting.The potential longer term benefits: In the long term we anticipate that the KHub will be the authoritative one-stop place for learning how to give and receive emotional support.

More than 50% have arrived in Greece and Italy. More than 5,000 migrants and refugees died in the Mediterranean Sea trying to reach Europe , mainly through Greece and Italy and for the first month of 2018 almost 500 died. All children fleeing conflict, especially those traveling alone are vulnerable to abuse- sexual and labor exploitation including trafficking, being sold and being coerced into marriage, in their homes, communities, society or in places where migrants and/or refugees reside - including reception centers, refugee camps or informal settlements at source, transit and destination countries. There is an emerging need in understanding the diverse conditions of migration, how they may influence children and what professionals and volunteers can do that effectively positively affect the wellbeing of these families. There is a need to protect and prevent unwanted situations within these families. Ecological-developmental models generally recognize that the parents' and child's experiences shape the course of their social development; but little is known about how key aspects of parental or child-rearing history, including immigration, affect components of social development across children from diverse ethnic groups. There are features of parental migration that are shared across national origin groups that may influence differential outcomes in early childhood. We consider one of these dimensions of immigration, the family- cultural aspects, and its influence on parenting practice and subsequent child social development.\r\nUnderstanding the impact of migration on children's and families within their own community and host country is a multifactorial and transnational issue. It requires considering parents' cultural origins and their migration histories. IENE projects highlighted the need for training of health workers/volunteers on providing culturally competent and compassionate care.  To approach the matter holistically multidisciplinary and transnationality are essential elements. \r\nThe project aims to provide education and training to professionals and volunteers working with migrants and refuges in regards to parenting skills, health care of the family and psychological support. It aims to enable them in providing support, knowledge and empowerment to migrant and refugee parents, which will help them to nurture, protect and educate their children under difficult circumstances. The proposal focuses on expanding the existing Knowledge hub (Khub) (IENE6) for nurses and other health professionals and volunteers (http://ienerefugeehub.eu/). \r\nObjectives\r\na) Review of the literature on the needs of migrant and refugee families with children on parenting skills, focusing on factors that provide resilience, as well as those factors that disempower parents and children during refugeedom \r\nb) Develop a curriculum for nurses and other health professionals and volunteers, to enable them to provide support, knowledge and skills on parenting and child-family health care needs, under extreme and unique conditions\r\nc) Develop bite-size learning units for parents to enable them in improving knowledge in regards to parenting and support of their children and family.\r\nd) Provide training for nurses and other health professionals and volunteers \r\ne) Use Khub to share stories from professionals regarding their experience and training refugee and migrant families with children on parenting related matters. \r\nf) Disseminate the results and the outputs of the project through workshops, webinars, national seminars\r\nTarget groups: health professionals, volunteers that are working with migrants/refugees; migrant and refugee families and children. It is difficult to estimate the exact number as many products will be used on line; about 200 professionals will be trained, 500 will visit Khub learning tools; 200 stakeholders/professionals in seminars, 75-100 migrant/refugee families use the learning tools.\r\nActivities\r\nCreation of an innovative curriculum based on culturally competent compassionate care for health workers and volunteer working with migrant and refugee families with children focusing on parenting skills. Health professionals, volunteers will participate in piloting. Health workers and volunteers will select, write and share the parenting stories from the refugee and migrant families and develop learning tool for parents. \r\nMethodology\r\nAn innovative pedagogical approach of co-production through co-creation principles and evidence from IENE projects will be used.\r\nResults, impact, benefits\r\nAll activities are geared towards delivering a high quality result.

Different forms  have evolved to encompass multi-and trans-disciplinary study by practitioners within their work context (Lester, 2004). The designation has also changed to include terms such as professional, industrial or practice-based PhDs or Doctorates (Fillery-Travis, 2012), called modern doctorates for the rest of this text . These developments are driven by the contribution to knowledge exchange these degrees make and how they facilitate innovation and growth within diverse sectors. But supervision of modern doctorates is currently not fully codified although it requires a  number of capabilities (academic and professional) recognised as being beyond those needed for conventional PhD supervision such as advising and facilitation (Boud & Costley, 2007). Previous research on PhD programmes has largely  focused on the competences required of candidates  (Vitae, 2010) not of their supervisors. However without effective supervision, delivery of the full benefits of these degrees to the host/sponsoring organisation (and the progression and attainment of the candidates) will be compromised. This project will identify best practice in the supervision of modern doctorates and codify it within a framework supported by appropriate resources (training workshop, examiner list, handbook and social media) for European universities and companies to leverage the innovation and new knowledge these degrees can produce. In moving beyond this state of the art the project objectives are to:\r\n\r\n(1) Access best practice in the supervision/advising of modern doctorates: \r\n\r\n(2) Identify the host/sponsoring organisation's requirements from supervision (if any) and their contribution to it\r\n\r\n(3) Develop a framework of practice (supported by training resources) suitable for modern doctorates\r\n\r\n(4) Disseminate this best practice framework to all stakeholders\r\n\r\n(5) Produce a sustainable impact on supervisory practice throughout the EU.\r\n\r\nThis project will strengthen cooperation between HEIs in the exchange of this practice and use Appreciative Inquiry(AI) (Cooperrider, Whitney, Stavros, & Fry, 2008) to gather and analyse the rich stories of emerging supervisory practice in the field and the challenges/dilemmas faced by stakeholders (using the Discovery and Dream Stages of AI). The stories, perceptions and practice examples collected will be analysed using thematic analysis (Guest, 2012)  in terms of opportunities and barriers to learning and how these have been addressed within supervisory practice. These themes will be collated within a practice framework using the meta-model approach of Lane & Corrie, 2006 (Design Stage). The resulting framework of practice will be the major output of the project and will be disseminated across the EU (Destiny and Delivery Stage). \r\n\r\nThe impact of the project at national level for candidates will be on progression as supervision practice facilitates their studies more appropriately and corresponding completion rates should improve. Overall there will be an evidence base for the doctoral journey for these candidates and that will manage expectations of their study and hence their overall satisfaction with their degree.\r\n\r\nSimilarly a rise in the number of doctoral programmes of this type offered is expected both within HEIs and across the sector. There has been a growth in numbers that is thought to be due to the perceived financial returns such programmes can command during these economically challenging times for the higher education sector across Europe. Whilst this is undoubtedly true there has been a barrier to further development as the supervision is  perceived to be complex (as it is!). An evidenced-based framework for supervision will lower such perceived barriers and drive growth in the area for the benefit of all stakeholders.  Specifically the framework will enable  HEIs to enter a market of industry/academic collaboration with an evidence based practice guide. This will enhance the capacity to leverage the full impact of such work both for the sponsoring organisation and the academic. This project contributes substantially to the needs of HEIs/organisations if they are going to be part of the Modernisation Agenda for HE. Specifically the project facilitates doctoral provision within the workplace focusing on research of immediate impact at the site of production. This is in direct alignment with the Modernisation Agenda which identifies the requirements for 'research training in HE...to be bettered aligned with the needs of the knowledge-intensive labour market' and 'encouragement of partnerships and cooperation with business as a core activity of HEI'.", "http://www.mdx.ac.uk", "MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA203-001629_coordinator"], [2015, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 63546.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.
