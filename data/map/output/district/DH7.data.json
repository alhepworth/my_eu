The aim of this project is to develop by multinational cooperation (exchange of good practices, use of innovative practices based on collaborative learning, critical thinking, ICT strategic use) instruments/methodologies/strategies to facilitate teaching/learning within the long-standing education context especially for the environment.\r\n\r\n     We have the following goals:\r\n1) Improvement of ecological knowledge, abilities and work competencies formally/non-formally for the 115 teachers of the nine partner schools with the purpose of developing a responsible attitude towards the environment within the educational/local communities of their origin.\r\n2) Development of competencies of  375 students in identifying environmental needs and problems in the communities they belong to and in initiating, implementing projects with the purpose of improving environment quality. \r\n3) Development of the capacity of the 8 schools to develop an eco-civic behaviour within students by cooperating with the community and the exchange of good and innovative practices.   \r\n\r\n   In the project activities there will be directly involved:\r\n- students with ages between 10-19  who will develop their competencies in identifying/investigating environmental issues, in writing/implementing environmental projects \r\n- teachers open towards an inter-institutitonal and international collaborative culture, interested in their own environmental professional development at European level\r\n- management teams of the 8 schools \r\n     A teacher training curriculum will be designed on environmental issues, which will be tested at partnership level and implemented in the eight schools. Teachers who will benefit from joint training activities (on environmental issues and ICT) will become training/information providers in their originating schools.\r\n     Participant meetings (teachers and students) with local partners involved in environment protection will take place in order to identify, investigate local environmental problems.\r\n     Teachers will jointly elaborate projects for formal curriculum integrated activities in different subjects, non-formal activities which will be tested at school level, adapted and improved. Students, supported by teachers, will design/implement school/local community environmental projects to solve the identified environmental problems. \r\n     All activities will have as results: ecology and ICT training of 35 teachers who will become training/information providers for a minimum of 95 teachers within the 8 schools, finding solutions for local environmental problems together with local environment partners, training of students/teachers in project management, student environmental projects, exchange of good practices, a Methodological Guide for Formal/Non-formal Ecological Education and Environmental Projects,  a Teacher Training Curriculum on Environmental  Issues, collection of ICT instruments integrated in ecological education, institutional development in the environmental education policy of the eight partner schools.\r\n    We expect a positive student, teacher, school,community impact: shaping and developing a responsible attitude towards the environment, of a student environmentally aware behaviour, developing  teacher work competencies and abilities in terms of environmental education, developing digital competencies and of communication in English language, increase of institutional capacity of approaching long-standing development education, development of inter-institutional cooperation relationships, completion of school-community-parents triad by attracting parents into activities, stimulation of student desire to carry on learning preventing risk of early school leaving. \r\n     Training of teachers at European standards , elaborated work instruments/strategies, exchange of good practices, opening of teachers and schools towards national/inter-sectorial/international cooperation will bring long-term benefits of partner institutions.

We took this quote and discussed the priorities of our schools and we talked about how writing can help promote cohesive communication across languages and cultures. Throughout history, writing has allowed people to communicate cultures, ideas and opinions. Nations and governments have been formed through written communication. Also, friendships and partnerships have been nurtured through written communication. From hieroglyphics to graffiti, from poetry to songs, writing and mark-making has always formed part of the communication process across borders and through time. We have an exciting opportunity to not only promote writing in our own schools, but to share this across Europe and indeed across the universe!\r\n\r\nThe main aim of our project is to tackle under-acheivement in writing. All partners identified this as a need. We will tackle this by creating an imaginative and engaging scenario involving aliens visiting our schools and this will encourage children to want to write. They will have a purpose and their writing will be seen throughout the universe, not just by their teacher, who is usually their only reader. By creating these scenarios, we will involve the whole school community. Parents will be invited to write with their children, the local community will be invited to take part in workshops, and teachers will have the opportunity to share best practice not only in their own school, but across all the partner schools. School governors will be regularly updated the impact of the project on writing achievement in the school. This will be measured by teachers' assessments and will be compared with progress made before the launch of this project.\r\n\r\nGuided by the co-ordinating school in the UK, all partners will use the 'Timetable of Activities' to plan the specific activities in their schools in the correct timeframe. Each question will be \"owned\" by a named partner, who will ensure that it is appropriately planned and that the results are collated in a timely manner. \r\n- 'What do you read?' will be managed by the Finnish partner.\r\n- 'What do you write?' will be managed by the Cypriot partner.\r\n- ' What do you eat?' will be managed by the Polish partner.\r\n- 'What do you sing?' will be managed by the Turkish partner.\r\n- 'Who are you?' will be managed by the Spanish partner.\r\n\r\nThe overall review and reporting procedures will be managed by the co-ordinating school in the UK. Communication throughout will be through the eTwinning TwinSpace and this will be open and transparent. \r\n\r\nThe number one impact expected on participants is that children's ability to write for different purposes will improve and their achievement in writing will have positive results. This is the basis on which the project is based. The target groups for this will be the children involved in the project in the eight participating schools.\r\nFor the organisations involved, it is expected that educators' expertise in teaching writing will improve so that they can ensure that all children make progress regardless of their personal circumstances.\r\nThe pan-European nature of this project means that all stakeholders will benefit from exposure to the benefits of European working and to the value of a European community. This community is not determined by borders, unions or historical backgrounds, but instead on a basis of mutual respect, communal working and shared desires to enrich the educational experience of children everywhere.", "http://www.lanchesterep.durham.sch.uk", "Lanchester EP Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036822_coordinator"], [2017, "\"Wir teilen unserer Geschichten\" - Entwicklung europ\u00e4ischer Einheit durch das Verstehen von Literatur", "Lanchester EP Primary School", 88487.0, 4, 4, "Our project \"Sharing our Stories\"-Developing European unity through the understanding of literature puts a main focus on the support of the understanding of literature and the strengthening of key competences, so that the children have knowledge, a social and eclogical sense of responsibility, education, joy, imagination, wealth of ideas and readiness for duty at their disposal.\r\nWe refer to the strategical frame for the European cooperation in the field of universal and professional education (ET 2020) and the previous programme \"Universal and professional education in 2010\" (ET2010).\r\nOur project pursues the following strategic aims:\r\n- Realisation of lifelong learning by the study of national and international literature,\r\n- Improvement of the quality and efficiency of the general and professional education by the support of literacy and language skills,\r\n- Support of  justice and solidarity by co-operative learning arrangements taking into account different learning conditions.\r\nIn our partner schools many children come from educational-distant and socially less privileged families.

In all partner schools there are children with the following special needs: learning problems, social and emotional development, mental development, language problems or physical and motor development. The schools are inclusive and develope strategies to promote the children in their development. In addition, many children are threatened by educational disadvantages because they have no access to analogous and digital literature in their families. We want to compensate this.\r\nBecause of the political development in Europe and worldwide it is important for us that primary school children get in contact with children of the same age of other European countries. \r\n\r\nWe pursue the following project aims:\r\n- Teaching to tolerance,\r\n- Development of social competence and cooperation ability,\r\n- Integration of children with social disadvantages or special educational needs,\r\n- Support of the reading, writing competence and linguistic competence,\r\n- Support of the first language and foreign language competence,\r\n- Support of creativity,\r\n- Support of problem solution competence,\r\n- Getting to know other European cultures,\r\n- Support of responsibilty for digital media.\r\n\r\nDuring interdisciplinary lessons, project weeks, project days and in study groups the children of all partner schools work on their reading abilities and reading experiences,  reading strategies, presenting texts and handling with media. They deal with literature of authors of their own and other European countries. Besides, they use different text forms (e. g. , poems, stories, children's books) as writing motivation. Children write profiles of authors or write and designe invitations for parents, neighbours, nursery schools, secondary schools and the school public.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the project, the children will profit  from:\r\n- the project website\r\n- foreign language study groups\r\n- working with children of different ages\r\n- digital media\r\n- the school library\r\n- to regular visits of libraries, author's readings, child theatre\r\n- regular reading activities", "http://www.lanchesterep.durham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035597_3"], [2014, "Auf den Fl\u00fcgeln der Fantasie durch Europa", "Lanchester EP Primary School", 66007.0, 5, 5, "Our project \"On the wings of imagination through Europe\" puts a main focus on the support of creativity and the strengthening of key competences, so that the children have knowledge, a social and ecological sense of responsibility, education, joy, imagination, wealth of ideas and readiness for duty at their disposal.

Our primary schools in Unna, Pisa, Palaiseau, Lanchester and Ajka go resume the preexperiences of the children from parental home and nursery school and promote these competences, so that they can change from primary to secondary schools without any difficulties.

In addition, many children are threatened by educational disadvantages because they have no access to literature, art, museums or computer in their families. \r\nThe main aims of the project are the support of creativity and problem solution competence, the support of cultural awareness and capability of cultural expression, the support of first language and foreign language skills, computer competence, learning competence, social competence, initiative and enterprise competence.\r\nIn our project, the children develop curiosity, openness, experimental joy, creative handling of technologies, materials and tools and economical dealing with resources, e.g., concerning time, material or work routines. They produce individual and original results, e.g., artistic products and processes and tell about them in conversations and texts. Moreover, they develop expression and explanatory power of an artistic solution, and the ability to plan and realise contributions for common projects with other children. In doing so, they highly strengthen their verbal and written communication and reflection competences in their mother tongue.\r\nThe children of all partner schools experiment in interdisciplinary lessons, in projects and study groups in the fields \"Coloured shapes, graphic and spatial shapes, shapes with technical-visual media, discussion about pictures and objects of artists of their home country and other European countries\".
