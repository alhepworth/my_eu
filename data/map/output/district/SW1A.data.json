In last years a not correct management of emergencies often created critical situations. In the happening of a catastrophic event, it is human behaviour-- and often human behaviour alone--that determines the speed and efficacy of the crisis management efforts. Frequently speed and efficacy do not stem from the ignorance of procedures, but from the difficulty to operate in contexts where consistent damages are occurring, for the difficulty of managing emotional aspects. Training plays an important function to the preparation of the crisis manager. Currently two main modalities for training purpose are two: table top exercise and real world simulation exercise. Table top exercises are low cost and can be easily and frequently organized, but it cannot recreate the real atmosphere, (e.g. stress, confusion) and need to keep critical decisions in very little time. On the other hand, crisis managers trained through simulation exercises on the field can be very effective, but such a simulations are very expensive and cannot be easily and quickly organized. PANDORA will bridge the gap between table-top exercises and real world simulation exercises, providing a near-real training environment at affordable cost. In a real-time, physics-based environment, PANDORA authentically simulates all the dynamic elements of the entire disaster environment. PANDORA will emulate a complete crisis room: realistic 3D visuals and audio create a truly immersive, chaotic and stressful environment.

The unemployment rate in the city is around 20% this year, and it is essential to support young people of these profiles so that they can access their first jobs, with scientific and technical reinforced skills, and with hands-on business skills, and, In addition, other language skills and key skills that will give them competitive edge in the job market.The Consortium therefore considers that the project responds to this problem and to the needs of students from VET level in these sectors.  Based on this situation in the city, and having made an analysis of the results of the previous projects developed KA 1 under Erasmsus +, the Consortium has the following objectives for the project:        + Objective 1: To promote labor mobility of VET students that are part of the Consortium through a supplement to their theoretical and practical training received in Spain. Newly qualified students will perform an internship in European companies of their sectors to improve their specific professional qualification, while acquire socio-cultural and linguistic skills in different destinations.        + Objective 2: To foster entrepreneurship and openness to new ideas and ways of working, not only from the point of view of the students but also the teachers of the schools of the consortium and of the management. There is a clear determination of the Consortium to deepen the partnership with all partners in the project., Moving therefore towards the internationalization of education in the VET level. They have already taken steps since this is already the third time that this project is submitted with virtually the same partnership.        + Objective 3: Bringing the positions between the needs of businesses in the municipality and the profiles and skills of young people, and for that the City project will provide all resources and services of dialogue and collaboration with companies in all municipal areas as well as all public resources of employment and guidance, both on its own and as an employee.EUROEMPL\u00c9ATE III Consortium is led by the city of Oviedo, and consists of the following partners:       >> IES Pando       >> IES Doctor Fleming       >> COL Masaveu Foundation       >> IES Leopoldo Alas Clarin   * Regarding the partner organizations they have been selected as follows:       >> 3 intermediary bodies, Euroyouth (Lisbon), European Accademia di Firenze (Florence) and Intern Europe (Belfast)       >> Different host companies in different sectors (Florence, Belfast and Lisbon)The project involves the mobility of 20 recent graduates of VET centers.

The goal is to foreseeing changes in the paradigm of the school.For that, the teacher will receive training in the central area of Sciences and Pedagogy in a perspective of development of activities centered in the student perspective \"Inquiry Based learning\".The project team shall consist of Pedagogical Director, Dra. Maria Jos\u00e9 Falc\u00e3o, the Psychologist, Dra. Miriam Cores and the Finance Director, Dra. Maria Jos\u00e9 Antunes.For the mobility we will have the support of intermediary partner, already well known from previous projects, for logistical support, support of students and placing them in appropriate placements according to their profile and professional skills.Students will be placed in leading companies within their sectors and appropriate to their goals and expectations. Some of these companies are already indicated by intermediary partners, and confirmed its participation in the project by signing the Partnership Charter.This new phase we will begin the implementation of the ECVET system certification. Being the first step of ECVET in EPTOLIVA we will do it as an experiment, working only one of the courses or task of each course.Apart from ECVET, we will make sure mobilities are dully certified through the following instruments: Europass Mobility; internship certificate and certificate of EPTOLIVA.It will perform the pre-selection and selection of candidates according to clear and transparent criteria selection, which will be known to all students.We will organize all the logistics of mobility of students, through the acquisition of travel, housing organization, purchasing insurance, CESD, transfers and local transportEPTOLIVA will provide a good preparation of students before departure at the level of their personal, social, cultural and professional skills. As part of preparing the young people it will also be made available diagnostic licenses and learning languages of the OLS.Accompany and permanently monitoring of the students will be made through email and telephone contacts with partners and participants.The evaluation of the project and mobility will be done to understand what can be improved. For this we will have direct evaluations by participants: for mobility, upon return to face trial and four months after returning to understand the real impact of this experience. In terms of project evaluation, the participants evaluation will count greatly, but also the team meetings and with partnersThe dissemination of project will be made through the following means: Seminar at the end of the project; Preparation of a brochure of the project; Creation of articles and press releases; Sending notices about the project through the mailing list; update with the website and the EPTOLIVA Facebook; Dissemination in newspapers and municipal bulletins energized by the Municipalities that support EPTOLIVA.Annually we will send an average of 8 to 10 participants per year. At the moment, we do not expect to have the need to send accompanying persons for the trust that we have established with partners and we are sure the participants will be properly welcomed and accompanied.Through the annual implementation of mobility projects it is expected that young people enhance their personal and professional profile, making them more apt to national and international labor market.

In others, as Brazil and Argentina, the federal governments are developing policies aimed at over-regulating the media and the internet. In Bolivia, Peru, and Dominican Republic, among others, social inequalities are so high that poverty undermines any chance of civic engagement. Born in this reality, the current generation of youngsters face many obstacles to participate politically or economically. Nevertheless, the current events have shown that this youth is ready to take the responsibility for its future. During the last year, almost 2 million people rallied on the Brazilian streets demanding more transparency and government efficiency. Currently, the Venezuelan youth is rallying for a more democratic political system.The International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY), composed of more than 100 youth organisations from more than 70 countries, is aimed at using its 67-year experience to provide tools that grant autonomy, self-determination and entrepreneurial skills to the Latin American youth through a strategically planned project that includes (1) strengthening a regional network of civil society organizations, (2) providing replicable knowledge and tools through (2.a) two international seminars separated by a 4-month interval each, (2.b) locally organized follow-up activities and (2.c) a continuously supervised and mapped virtual network, and (3) organizing a Capacity Building Course that will equip young people with Non Formal Education methods to multiply the outcomes of the project.
