The applicant will develop a cultural awareness of another European country that will be shared with children, colleagues and parents. Using the E-twinning portal the applicant will work together with teachers in a different European country to share ideas and exchange best practice in teaching a modern language. This will create a European dimension in our nursery with the children being more aware of their place in the wider world.During the immersion course the applicant will develop her understanding of using the Internet and ICT resources to enhance the teaching and learning of modern languages. This learning will be shared with staff in the nursery and all colleagues will be provided with the necessary skills and competences to integrate Spanish into daily routines in the nursery. In the long term this will create a team who work together to develop pedagogical strategies for delivering modern languages to young learners. Learning will also be shared with parents and the wider community by creating an interactive display and by producing a leaflet in an attempt to develop their language skills and engage them in their children's learning.After the immersion course the applicant will evaluate the impact on all learners. This will include having observations by the head teacher and colleagues.

Our highest priority and main objective  is to increase our teacher's competence and boost confidence in delivering exposure to Modern Languages. \r\n\r\nNumber/Profile of Participants\r\nAfter a presentation and selection process 4 of our teachers were identified as having a clear need to increase their language skills to allow them to gain greater confidence in delivering languages as part of the new curriculum.\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities:\r\nTo complement the training provided by the local authority, the 1 teachers will take part in language immersion activities in France.

The Portuguese host partner is a regional training and coaching complex used by Portuguese and European professional teams which are applauded as having world class records in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the professional ranks of UK clubs are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European exposure will improve employability in secondary careers. \r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives :\r\n1. Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility apprentices and apprentices in Europe.\r\n3. Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country.\r\n5. Increased maturity and sense of initiative.\r\n6. Increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n7. Enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\n8. More active participation in work and social environments.\r\n9. Enhancement of soft skills.\r\n10. Increased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n\r\nOur Portuguese partner and the associated local Portuguese clubs are fully committed to this Erasmus+ project, having successfully hosted IVT and/or VETPRO participants from a variety of European countries funded under the previous Leonardo da Vinci Lifelong Learning Programme. Cowdenbeath FC have previously completed successful self-funded mobility trips and these experiences have formed the foundation for this Erasmus+ funding application.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate aim of the project will be an increase in employability of participants achieving success as a professional footballer or gaining employment in a secondary career pathway. These are medium/long term surveys, which will be undertaken by SAFC following completion of mobility. Contact will be maintained with participants on completion of their vocational education and employment status, job description, salary levels and contract status (permanent or fixed term) will be recorded and will be used in the dissemination process. \r\n\r\nAside from our own internal evaluation processes, Cowdenbeath FC will participate in a Sector Skills Alliance (SSA) involving other UK professional football clubs who are participating in Erasmus+ VET Learner mobility.
