The volunteers will be based in South Wales, and will be engaged in various different kinds of youth works with clubs and schools in the area. The projects will focus on themes such as cultural awareness, non-formal learning, community cohesion, land mangament, ICT and youth work.  All the projects will engage with young people in the South Wales area with a focus on promoting promoting diveristy and intercultural understanding. \r\n\r\nThe activities (EVS) will be long term (11 months) to allow the volunteers\u2019 time to really get involved with the Youth Centre & schools and the work that they do, as well as having the opportunity to develop their own personal projects. Through non-formal and informal learning methods the volunteers will increase their knowledge and experience in international youth work. The project will allow young people from Europe to interact, share ideas, exchange cultures and learn about each other in a safe and supportive environment.  The volunteers will be fully integrated into the activities of the hosting organisation and will be given the opportunities to focus on elements that most interest them and to develop new skills, experiences and knowledge that will enhance their employability and personal professional development.\r\n\r\nVolunteers will be encouraged to bring ideas and opinions from their countries of residence to the UK to share with each other, to break down international barriers, as well as take new ideas back to input into their society, thereby creating a wider European Community.\r\n\r\nAlongside their project work, the volunteers will also attend common days each month where they can share their experiences and participate in workshops and training focusing on diversity, racism, xenophobia, migration and active citizenship. Through the common day activities, the volunteers shall obtain tools and knowledge that they then bring back into the communities they are volunteering in to actively promote diversity and create more welcoming and open minded communities in South Wales.  This will promote active citizenship and will help to foster engagement in the local community whilst bringing to light both global and local issues.", "http://www.valleyskids.org", "UNA Exchange", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-035999_4"]]}}, "2BD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Community Impact of Sports Clubs", "Cambrian Village Trust", 99648.0, 4, 10, "This project will supplement an \u201cinnovative\u201d 10-week (6 hours a day/2days a week), work-based football training programme that introduces economically inactive and unemployed people to the commercial management of football clubs.  The participants involved are taught how to run marketing, coaching & community activities.  They acquire accredited qualifications, work experience & skills that not only help them get a better job in the future, but also increase their general life chances.  By positioning learning within the context of the Sports industry, we get commitment from participants who have historically struggled with personal motivation towards learning.  This project will further enhance that learning experience by introducing them to best practice in European Football Clubs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll 60 participants will be economically inactive or unemployed before enrolling on the programme, over the age of 16 and living in social deprived areas of Wales.  Specifically we will be targeting: 40 NEET people aged between 18 & 25 years; 10 individuals over the age of 50; 5 individuals living in supported accommodation; and 5 with challenging behaviour or learning difficulties.  Many\r\n\r\nParticipants will be from families of multi-generational unemployment, homeless, or early school leavers, and have little or no aspirations in relation to what employment could potentially do for them.  The mobility widens their horizons and raises their aspirations, and helps break the cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur objectives are that the participants go on to: \r\n\r\n   (a) take a higher level coaching qualifications to UEFA license level. \r\n\r\n   (b) undertake higher level business/marketing qualifications\r\n\r\n   (c) enter the labour market be it in the football or sports industry\r\n\r\n   (d) learn foreign languages\r\n\r\n   (e) achieve positive outcomes and life skills\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the European placement they will:\r\n\r\n- observe and shadow Youth Academy coaches\r\n\r\n- deliver coaching sessions to Youth teams\r\n\r\n- take part in seminars from leaders in major European football clubs (Benfica, AC Milan, Torino FC, etc) on nutrition, Psychology, Commercial development and marketing\r\n\r\n- go on stadium tours, sightseeing and watch a football match\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Erasmus+ project is finally complete, a journey will come to an end. Although long in duration this journey will have witnessed 60 participants develop both as individuals & professionals. People whom previously had no skills or qualifications, lacked in confidence, & were long term unemployed; will have a totally different outlook and a renewed sense of hope & belief. They will have a high level of self-esteem, and possess the skills and qualities they need to seek, remain and progress in future employment, training or education. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo create a sense of self-fulfilment, and for potential employers to fully understand what training they have completed; the skills they have acquired; and the work experience they have gained. It is of paramount importance that several forms of recognition for their continued effort & commitment throughout the duration of the project are given. It would be a huge disappointment for everyone involved if the participants attended without any form of recognition.", null, "Vi-Ability Educational Programme", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000434_3"]]}}, "2XX": {"esif": {"data": [[1517443200000, 1604102400000, "Robertstown, Aberdare", "Rhondda Cynon Taff Council", "Land scheme to construct 11 new business units located on a site next to Aberdare train station and Coleg y Cymoedd.", "ERDF", 2580001.0, 3932869.0, "erdf_wales_81803"]]}}}}
