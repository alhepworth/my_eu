The project respond to the problem of a growing intolerance on religions and religious expressions which is endangering societies in Europe. To grow towards a united and peaceful Europe, the young Europeans are key players. However, there is a lack of awareness of key concepts of a culture of peace, lack of taking responsibility, lack of information about other faiths and religions, and lack of knowledge about other cultures. This is manifested often in hate-speech or discriminatory speech or actions. \r\n\r\nThe project will involve youth from different sectors, regardless of their religion, ethnicity and gender and they will come from seven partner organisations: Sweden, Belgium, Finland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, the United Kingdom and Serbia.

To raise participants\u2019 understanding and awareness of key concepts of a culture of peace, European citizenship, religious diversity and interfaith and multicultural approach to building peace. \r\n2. To empower young people with inclusive and interfaith leadership skills equipping them with knowledge and tools for leading responsible actions for peace in their countries, NGOs or local communities. \r\n3. To increase youth self-esteem and motivation for an active participation in their organizations and in society valuing their perspectives and enhancing their inner and relational skills.\r\n4. To provide young people with communication and public opinion formation skills helping them to  set up teams of citizen reporters in the countries of those participating in the workshop. \r\n5.

To offer alternatives to the present situation of inward-looking preoccupation and discrimination, by creating space for mutual learning.\r\n\r\nThe project will use interfaith and inter-cultural learning methodologies promoting participation, critical thinking, creativity and cooperation. The project will be based on the combination of innovative educational trainings and exposure to interfaith dialogue with religious leaders and experts.

By separating metadata from essence, controlling all the image and sound processing operations from the metadata layer, we can maintain the underlying data library unchanged while enabling a new generation of more flexible applications. This will radically reduce the amount of data created: new versions, grades, or language releases only result in additional metadata, not new data files. The system will support a more automated workflow for content distribution from postproduction to the assembly, distribution and playout of multiple variations of programmes in different formats and locations. Outcomes will be:\\tAn infrastructure in which multi-Petabye data stores are managed by persistent metadata in a distributed metadatabase.\\tReal-time interaction with media sequences selected from the data store.

They have learnt the skills to plan a strategic audience engagement campaign focusing on targeted audiences that need to see the film in order to create change at political, legal, corporate or public level.In order to achieve this, the participants have learnt what we mean by creating change, how to create a solid and realistic budget, how to raise funds from traditional and non-traditional funders, how to establish and build relationships with partners who can provide access to expertise, networks, legal advice, etc, as well as how to build the strongest team who can deliver the campaign goals and communicate the film campaign's message to audiences.An Impact Producer is also able to deliver the campaign, collect data and deliver an evaluation report to funders and other interested parties to demonstrate what real impact the film has made on civil society. To get an idea of what an Impact Report looks like please visit the library section of the Impact Field Guide: http://impactguide.org/library.As more and more filmmakers have the ambition to create impact with their work and their success has created more interest and excitement in the unique role films can play in social or environmental change, there is a real need for Impact Producers to take these films from completion to impact.The goal of the Lab is to set good practices and to recognize the role and importance of an Impact Producer in the field.
