These pupils on entry are way below what is expected with their social and emotional development. This has a huge impact on their ability to learn. In our school development plan we have identified the need to adapt our teaching styles and methodologies in order to address these issues. As a result of this, in our nursery and foundation provisionwe have begun teaching more in the outdoor setting. A few of the EYFS staff team have gone on some specialised training but we feel in order to have an impact on all pupils it is necessary for many more teachers to go on training. As it is a whole school approach we need to adapt and change our pedagogies and therefore the head teacher and senior management will also attend the courses looking at leadership and learning in the outdoors. By sending staff from across all key stages as well as EYFS we build on the competencies of teachers delivering exciting lessons which will enable our learners to become confident, resilient which in turn will impact on their health and well- being. This in turn will then affect the way pupils learn in all areas and have impact on their achievements throughout school. We hope to look at the Swedish education system policies and impact of less formal education until the age of 7 then the formal education of 7-11 year olds. We will compare and contrast with our own education system.\r\n \r\nThe number and profile of participants will be as follows: the senior leadership team, 7 staff members including the head teacher, EYFS, NQT, new staff, KS1 and KS2 ( 13 more teachers). We hope for four mobility\u2019s- each time a member of SLT will attend to ensure rigorous monitoring and reporting.  The SLT will look at ways to improve their leadership and management skills and ensure staff build on their knowledge of new pedagogies and styles of teaching in a formal and informal setting. We will make use of the E twinning to share our new teaching styles and methodologies throughout our school but also with local primaries in our cluster. We will also share our learning with parents, governors and other schools and also have daily blogs whilst on the courses and upload information on our school website.\r\n We hope for staff confidence to grow as the project develops over the 2 years and the new competencies and strategies become embeded into the teaching and learning at Button Lane Primary School.", "http://buttonlane.manchester.sch.uk", "Button Lane Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047032_coordinator"]]}}, "9BP": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Target language improvement in the MFL classroom", "The Manchester Health Academy", 1606.0, 1, 1, "We have a focus in school about improving literacy and within MFL we are very keen on improving the pupils speaking skills along with reading and writing.

The unnecessary use of antibiotics is a key driver in the development of antibiotic resistance. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) represents a unique disease model to study bacterial resistance and to explore therapeutic strategies for same, as chronic lung infection overlaps with acute lung exacerbations caused by a multitude of organisms that traditionally evolve various mechanisms of resistance. With time, chronic polymicrobial infection develops, with the most dominant infecting organism being Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is also important in other infections including wounds, burns and patients with medical devices, making it an important clinical target for the EU. In CF infections, empiric intravenous antibiotics are usually given for two weeks. Recurrent infections and treatments result in increasing antimicrobial resistance, and alterations in pathogen host interactions in the lung and gut flora. Next-generation DNA sequencing technology now offers DNA-based personalised diagnostics and treatment strategies. Enhancing our knowledge of the microbiome allows the use of stratified targeted antibacterial therapy that can be compared with standard empirical antibacterial therapy currently used. We believe this will reduce antibiotic usage, optimize dosage and duration startegies as the therapy will be tailored to the actual individual patient needs.

Unfortunately, most present with inoperable lesions for which median survival is less than 12 months. Based on our previous clinically successful experiences with in vivo completely tissue engineered tracheal replacement in benign tracheal diseases, we recently applied this technology in 2 patients with otherwise inoperable primary tracheal cancers. The successful observed outcome confirms the unique opportunity to scale-up an effective therapeutic approach into a widely accessible clinical technology, which could enhance not only the quality of life but even cure otherwise untreatable patients. However, a limitation of our current technology is the time it takes to re-populate the decellularized trachea. This may prove critical in the case of cancer patients. Further, the size of the transplant is currently limited due to the fact that the transplanted tissue needs to be efficiently and rapidly vascularised to prevent necrosis in vivo. To surmount these limitations, we aim to: i) improve our current technique of in vivo tissue engineering human tracheae in a small number of patients and subsequently begin a formal clinical trial, ii) develop pharmacological approaches to activate endogenous stem cells, stimulate tissue regeneration and vascularisation in situ, iii) develop a synthetic tracheal scaffold using a novel nanocomposite polymer as alternatives to natural human scaffolds and iv) develop good medical practice manufacturing process for safe, efficient and cost effective commercial production.

Physiological angiogenesis is controlled by a complex interplay between cells and their environment: the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides signaling via numerous ECM adhesion molecules and growth factors bound to ECM polysaccharide components; and cells locally degrade and remodel the ECM to create pores into which angiogenic endothelial cells migrate. This observation, that physiological angiogenesis proceeds in response to solid-phase cues motivates our approach, namely creating bioactive resorbable materials as scaffolds that contain bound molecular signals to induce physiological angiogenesis in situations of tissue repair and regeneration. In some of our scaffold materials, porosity is inherent by virtue of fabrication, and in others porosity is created by cell-associated proteolysis as it is in physiological angiogenesis. All materials will be designed so as to be injectable or implantable into the human body. In some work, the final injectable/implantable material will comprise only materials and bioactive biomolecular signals, and in other cases it will also comprise cells. Thus, the concept of ANGIOSCAFF is to create materials that are bioresponsive (to environmental signals including pH and redox potential, and to cellular signals such as proteases), that are bioactive (by virtue of bound peptide or recombinant protein adhesion ligands and bound and releasable growth factors), and that are capable of carrying cellular therapeutics. To realize ANGIOSCAFF, we have assembled a team comprising both industrial and academic expert groups in biomaterials design and development, experts in the science and application of angiogenesis, in imaging in animal models, and in applications demanding biomaterials-based, angiogenesis-demanding tissue engineering therapies, including repair of bone, skin, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle and nerve.", 60620.0, 13316086.0, 8, 33, "ANGIOSCAFF", "http://www.angioscaff.eu", null, null, "fp7_88874_998751674"]]}}}}
