This infrastructure will be able to also support a wide variety of 5G applications with special emphasis on services from various industries vertical to the ICT.\nThis will be achieved by architecting new access-facing and core-facing nodes, complete with storage and compute facilities, interconnected by novel, spectrally efficient, and adaptive optical transmission networks. Advanced concepts, such as hardware disaggregation and virtualisation, will assist in hitting challenging cost targets whilst enabling automation and programmability \u2013 all supported by a purpose-designed SDN-based control plane which will interface with client applications, intelligently catering for the wide range of 5G KPIs. \nMETRO-HAUL will coordinate the disparate elements of transmission, switching, networking, compute, and storage, orchestrating dynamic solutions for multiple 5G applications. \nMETRO-HAUL will carry out Proof of Concept demonstrations of its networking solution involving the interconnection of metro node prototypes, the use of the project's transmission technologies, and the associated control plane and orchestration software.

Such traffic increase is impacting on both network costs and power consumption. Moreover, traffic is not only increasing but becoming much more dynamic, both in time and direction. For these reasons, transport network evolution from current DWDM systems towards elastic optical networks, based on flexgrid transmission and switching technologies, could significantly increase both transport network scalability and flexibility. Further benefits come from multilayer interworking mechanisms enabling electronic switching technologies (IP/MPLS, OTN, etc) to directly control the bandwidth of the Bandwidth Variable Transponders (BVT) for optical bandwidth optimization purposes.This then defines the key objective behind IDEALIST: To research in detail a cost and power efficient transport network architecture able to carry a wide range of signal bandwidths, each of which will be varying in real time in direction and magnitude, and some of which will be extremely large and possibly exceeding 1Tb/s. The network architecture proposed by IDEALIST is based on four technical pillars:\u0095 Transport systems enabling flexible transmission and switching beyond 400Gbps per channel.\u0095 Control plane architecture for multilayer and multidomain elastic optical networks.\u0095 Dynamic network resources allocation at both IP and elastic optical layers\u0095 Multilayer network optimization tools enabling both off-line planning and on-line network re-optimization in elastic optical networks.The intention is that the IDEALIST network architecture will be easily industrialised.

Specialities will be such as \"ICT\" = Information and Communications Technology, Renewable Energy, Industrial Mechanics, Electrical Installation, Industrial Automation Systems, Welder, Chemistry, Logistics, Management, Finances, Comercial Management, etc... \r\n\r\nOur project starts from a new concept which consists in complementing the value of the CP with a traineeship in a foreign labour environment, which is real but strange, and they will have the chance to use their recently acquired knowledge and skills in a different language. Therefore, the CIFO will provide language courses in order to improve adaptation in the host country. \r\n\r\nCandidates will have to prepare a CV in the Europass format and a motivation letter in the language of the host country or in English as common language.

One of the SOC (Employment Service of Catalonia) priorities is to foster and ensure people\u2019s professional qualification. In order to achieve this priority, the SOC has a high value tool: the Professional Training and Innovation Centres (CIFO). The training activity of the CIFOs is based on imparting specific and quality training actions for employment matching the needs of people, companies and territories. They provide the necessary theoretical and practical training to achieve or improve skills in order to contribute to the employability of their pupils, which are unemployed registered as job seekers in the Job Centre. We have 8 CIFOs, each one with its own specific specialities. 100 participants will be chosen to take part in this project among the pupils in the CIFOs taking part in the courses addressed to obtain a Certificate of Proficiency (CP) within the Vocational Training for Employment supply 2014-2015. In the moment of their registration they will have to show interest in taking part in this project.\r\n\r\nThose who succeed in their training courses, will be given the opportunity to enter a selection process for 16 weeks traineeship in a European company within the next year after obtaining their CP. Specialities will be such as \"ICT\" = Information and Communications Technology, Renewable Energy, Industrial Mechanics, Electrical Installation, Industrial Automation Systems, Welder, Chemistry, Logistics, Management, Finances, Comercial Management, etc... \r\n\r\nOur project starts from a new concept which consists in complementing the value of the CP with a traineeship in a foreign labour environment, which is real but strange, and they will have the chance to use their recently acquired knowledge and skills in a different language. Therefore, the CIFO will provide language courses in order to improve adaptation in the host country. \r\n\r\nCandidates will have to prepare a CV in the Europass format and a motivation letter in the language of the host country or in English as common language. We have a network of intermediary partners which are experts in mobility management in different European countries.

The qBID will provide planning, monitoring and evaluation of the stay abroad of the Catalan participants in this project.

As a novelty for this project, the qBID will include on-line monitoring methods of the traineeship abroad. A Training Agreement containing the Erasmus + own prescriptions will be designed in this tool as well as an Activity Plan, dimensioning the dedication time for each skill, anticipating the evaluation, monitoring the work of the trainee and the trainee himself will be able to value how the internship is appropriate to their previous training, the tutor will evaluate the trainee and will qualify the results and the company will evaluate the evolution and the profile of the trainee. Once the stay is finished, a follow-up process will take place, regarding the employability of the participant after 3/6, and 12 months through indicators. \r\n\r\nAn increase of the internship hours improves the qualification and the employability of the trainees.

Although the school is located in the Vomero district of Naples, which is supposed to be the more respectful city area, it hosts students from many surrounding areas, which are known for their urban and social decay. The connection to the metro line 1 between the Vomero and the Scampia district, built between 2005 and 2009, has, in fact, resulted in the increased number of students at risk, in terms of early school leaving.\r\nThe reality in which the school is located has, thus, led teachers to question themselves on how the school system can attract even the toughest guys towards learning and knowledge without penalizing the most deserving students.\r\nStarting from the need to defeat early school leaving and increase the education quality of the Institute in order to offer more employment opportunities for students, C.L.I.L. aims at deepening the use of new teaching methodologies and enhancing teachers\u2019 language skills, through the comparison with other European schools.\r\nSpecifically, the project involves the mobility of 20 teachers, 10 of which will be carrying out job shadowing activities in the United Kingdom (5 participants) and Malta (5 teachers) in order to identify and deepen the use of cooperative learning methods. The other 10 will follow structured courses, taught in English and French, in United Kingdom (5 participants) and France (5 teachers) in order to improve their language skills.\r\nCompared to new teaching methodologies,  it is expected the deepening of all the ways through which the students, guided by their teacher in quality of facilitator, can become active participants in their own learning process. Particular attention will also be paid to the analysis of educational strategies that allow a better integration of students, who would normally feel excluded during daily frontal lessons.\r\nAs regards, however, the structured courses of English and French, they will be provided by native speakers who will help participants improve their language skills, so that they can prepare and manage classes in Clil mode, once returned from the mobility.\r\nThe 20 teachers that will participate in the project  teach various disciplines (mathematics, marketing, economics, literature and law) and they are united by the need to update themselves in order  to properly  respond to the phenomenon of early school leaving, to deepen the knowledge of languages and to meet other foreign colleagues. Before their departure, they will receive a training of 46 hours divided as follows: 6 hours of guidance; 4 hours of cultural training; 30 hours of language training; and finally 6 hours on cooperative learning.\r\nThe project will develop a strong cooperation between all partners, which will be guaranteed by the signing of a specific agreement and a constant confrontation and dialogue, made possible by several  multimedia communication tools (Skype; drobox;  cloud).\r\nAs regards the project impact, C.L.I.L.  will produce its effect, first on the participants, who, thanks to their experience of mobility, will confront themselves with other foreign colleagues, by incorporating new teaching methodologies for the war against early school leaving. They will also improve their language skills and pass from a level of sufficient proficiency to an intermediate level. Mobility, especially for older teachers , hardened by daily difficulties and tired of a school system which isn\u2019t meritocratic, will renew their interest towards their own profession.\r\nThe Institute Giustino Fortunato will benefit, then, from more qualified teachers and therefore will increase its training quality. It is expected  the activation of two courses in foreign languages and that foresee the use of Clil methodologies. The project will also contribute to the reduction of 2% of school drop-out rates within the institute, which now stands at a rate of 36% out of the total number of members.\r\nThanks to an effective dissemination of results, guaranteed by the use of the eTwinning platform and the use of local and national press, C.L.I.L. will give its contribution at both regional, national and European level, presenting itself as an opportunity to deepen active inclusion strategies for learners and to enhance the school training offer.", "http://www.ectarc.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA101-035521_3"], [2015, "Erich-Bracher-Schule - international vocational training II", "ECTARC", 38279.0, 2, 2, "EBSivtII is a continuation of our program: Erich-Bracher-Schule international vocational training.

The EBS is located in the area of Ludwigsburg/ Stuttgart and therefore known as a logistic, European turnstile. Major traditional companies out of the automobile and engineering industry and a lot of other large- and small-scale enterprises are steadily operating in this region and are taking part in our Dual Education System.  In many companies required commercial skills are getting more and more international, as both internal and external business transactions are no longer only taking place in German language. Our school has already reacted to this by introducing general English as well as complementary Business English classes and for about 8 years now, our students have been offered the opportunity of also getting  an English Business Language Certificate. Nevertheless, nowadays this is not enough anymore.\r\nAppropriate international business behavior, cross-cultural communication and good communication skills are hugely important for our region. We would like to achieve all of that within the scope of an internship abroad. EBSivt (Erich-Bracher-School \u2013 international vocational training) is primarily meant for trainees in their first year who study to become wholesale and industrial clerks. Within their apprenticeship those trainees experience their own commercial company with all the different departments and processes while we, as a school, add theoretical content to this practical knowledge. The compulsory participation in general subjects offers further education.\r\nAt first EBSivt will start with only 4 participants in each flow, 8 participants all together within two planned flows each for about 4 weeks - the first week full-time language school and 3 weeks of internship in various companies; the participants will be staying in host families and this way can also take part in local cultural life. Our destination will be Wales in the United Kingdom as it has similar industrial structures as Germany. Due to the omission of the coal- and steel- industry, Wales still holds major industrial and automobile companies.  Located at the seaside Wales is an attractive business location for many international companies. The participants have the opportunity of getting new insights in economic- and company structures.\r\nOur partner organization ectarc in Llangollen will be organizing the stay in Wales, they will also be taking care of the students, EBS will be in charge of specialized, foreign-language and cultural preparation and post-processing. The Erich-Bracher-School will organize this whole project as an OES- Project and the plan is to integrate this process within the apprenticeship later.\r\nStaying abroad in Wales is supposed to improve the English language skills - the participants  are required to have good communication skills within the scope of business processes, a Business-English-Pocket- Guide, which they write themselves during their stay, will also be helpful for keeping new vocabulary. Different company processes in a different cultural background should complete and stabilize the students\u2019 theoretical and practical knowledge \u2013 while a separate \u201cinternship diary\u201d will save their internship experiences. By doing an internship abroad the participants will get more independent and independence is one of the key skills of everyday work life. Getting to know a different culture and living in a foreign country also improves cross-cultural communication skills. By the end of their stay all students will receive a certificate of Europass- Mobility and Europass-Language, a school certificate as well as a certificate of Erich-Bracher-Academy.\r\nBy the extension of our classes at EBS through EBSivt we expect a better and more networked cooperation with companies and an overall improvement of our traineeships. The participants will bring new perceptions to their company and everyone at school will also profit from the participants\u2019 experiences. Our school, the involved companies and last but not least also the city of Ludwigsburg will get more attractive and might therefore attract new partners in education and economy.

Currently the Bergmannsheil educates 16 vocational learners in 3 vocational business apprenticeships and medical-technical apprenticeships. A personnel director is responsible for the coordination of all apprenticeships, to guarantee for its quality and continuity. Besides there are about 85 pupils in our officially recognized nursing school.In 2016/2017 the Bergmannsheil for the second time takes part in a stay aboard project and for this reason uses the positive experiences of its Head of Human Resources with successfully completed projects he organized before.Our project partner is the European Center for Training and Regional Cooperation in Llangollen, Wales. It is officially accredited by the British Council for Teaching English. Its goal is to promote language acquisition and international work experience by organizing internships in Great Britain and other European countries.The Head of Human Resources of the Bergmannsheil has been in contact with the Executive Director of the European Center for Training and Regional Cooperation since numerous projects before.For a period of 6 weeks, four of our apprentices take part in the Erasmus + project in order to stay in Wales and take part in a language course to prepare for an internship. With this stay aboard we want to give our apprentices an opportunity to improve their language and soft skills for their apprenticeship relevant areas. We want to motivate and teach our apprentices competences, which are important in an internationalized workplace.Our apprentices stay in host families, where they also learn a lot about British culture and improve their speaking.The Bergmannsheil wants to intensify the cooperation with its project partner in order to send more apprentices in subsequent years and establish a permanent feature of the vocational education at the Bergmannsheil.Our apprentices are in 2016 and 2017 in their second year of their vocational training and get confronted with requests from foreign customers, patients and more and need to learn how to answer those properly. The participants of the project were submitted by their instructors on the basis of their vocational training and also their basic English skills which are needed for the stay aboard. Besides the improvisation of their language skills related to writing and speaking English, they will also improve their soft skills by being foreign and depend on help of their coworkers. This experience will support our apprentices to look out for the needs of their foreign coworkers.  After the stay aboard the participants obtain different certificates from our project partner and from the Bergmannsheil to use those for applications in future.We expect that this project also has a large local impact, as a vocational training at the Bergmannsheil gets more appealing for qualified pupils.", "http://www.ectarc.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002659_1"]], "extra": 2}}, "8SW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Rope and Water Rescue Training Sessions ( RWRTS)", "R3 Safety and Rescue Ltd", 6108.0, 2, 2, "This project is about 2 important specialties within Search and Rescue techniques (SAR) which can be used to save people in distress or imminent danger, i.e. water and rope rescue operations . The importance of having a good functional, fast response and proper set up rope and water rescue team which is capable of dealing with a variety of emergency situations, is imperative to the protection of  human lives.  The main aim of this project is that 8 participants who are involved in providing training on emergency response, lead operational rescue teams and form part of a rescue team, undergo further professional development course in UK  to  acquire a rope and  water rescue technician trainer certification.  Recently the ERRC and CPD  have embarked in a joint project so as to increase their human capital and know how with respect  specialized rescue.  Gozo has got limited resources when it comes to dealing with mass accidents or incidents of a certain nature and lacks expertise in this specialized area of rescue due to the fact that the number of interventions per year is very low.  ERRC considers that since Malta is now part of the EU, it must adopt the European standards and norms when it comes to the implementation of the emergency  rescue  services. The possibility exists that ERRC may be called to assist other international countries.  Besides that ERRC is providing  rescue services on 8 hour shift during the summer months.  Recently we are looking at overseas deployment and have a number of people deployed in Lesbos, Greece to assist  in the rescue of migrants. The project will enable 4 participants to follow a 15 day training assignment to acquire the necessary knowledge, awareness of new technologies and expertise in July 2016. Another 4 participants will be trained in specific areas of water rescue in October 2016. Having good professionally trained rescuers and instructors is essential for ERRC so the latter can further fulfill their roles in protecting lives, saving properties and further enhance the professional level of personnel who may be deployed during such incidents. The outcome of such project would be that the ERRC would have exposed its trainers to latest EU norms in this highly specialized area of water and rope rescue.  Doing so, it means that the  ERRC  would have acquired enough skills and experience so as to evaluate and implement any changes necessary in  the local system, and train the rest of the volunteers and other entities The project would expose the participants to innovative rescue methods in a different environment. The project aims in further training and provides in depth experience for leading rescuers, instructors and volunteers from the ERRC. The placement would provide the trainer with the necessary skills to be able to train other interested members. In this way, the project would increase our competencies in the field and therefore, have the ability to improve the system on a local level. In addition, the project would expose the participants to standards and emerging technologies in  rope and water  rescue and will enable participants to improve our system locally and develop further their professional skills and achieve in depth practical experiences that are not so common in Malta.  Back in Malta, the participants will unite, share their experiences and good practice and come up with a set of recommendations. The latter will be put forward by the participants which will be the basis of the formation of a local training programme. We believe that each participant would be empowered and provided with a unique opportunity. On an individual level, this project will have the following impact;raise awareness on the rope and water rescue operations;-extend the impact to the others;-engage with new stakeholders and target groups;-influence policy and practice;-develop new partnerships;-knowledge and experience gained by the trainers;-improved cultural awareness and better language skills( technical words);-learn how to work in a team work in distress situations;-learn how to facilitate learning on water and rescue operations;-to discuss and establish procedure on how to react in such scenariosBy carrying out this project, ERRC will open a new window of opportunity whereby this organisation can continue to work on helping people is difficult situations. This will give ERRC a boost approach on dealing with rescue and rope operations more effective, thus ending in better results. From this, ERRC will take an international leap as it can start assisting in helping other international organizations, when needs arise.", "http://www.r3sar.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-MT01-KA104-015133_1"]]}}, "8TG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Champions of  Languages and Minorities", "Ysgol Dinas Bran", 81212.0, 4, 5, "Background & objectivesIn light of today's economic hardships, political climate and the strong influence of globalisation, we are worried that young people do not have a strong enough sense of belonging and do not understand the importance of their cultural heritage and the role it plays in shaping their identity. Therefore, this project aims at making students realize the importance of language and their own culture for shaping identity and gain a deeper understanding of their cultural heritage. Participants The project involves six secondary schools from Italy,  Wales, Scotland, Poland and Finland, Switzerland (silent partner). Each school is located in an area where a minority language is spoken. However, how big the minority language is, what political and cultural autonomy the minority enjoys and what current problems the minorities face differ greatly and will provide the participants with a good basis for comparison and building new knowledge together.MethodologyThe project is structured around three subtopics: - understanding your own identity and culture- understanding the historical and geographical significance- understanding the concept minority, what role the minority plays in society (now and in the future) and what the students themselves can do to maintain the minorityThe methodological approach to these topics will include activities which focus on reflection, analysis, creative and critical thinking and and it will integrate several different school subjects. Creativity has been an operative word when designing the project activities and planning the outcomes and it will integrate several different school subjects as well as work methods based on theatre pedagogyResultsThe three main results of the project will be: 1) A manual for how to use theatre pedagogy exercises to increase understanding of oneself and the other. The manual can be used in schools, but also in integration work with immigrants and asylum seekers. 2) Festivals held in each participating country celebrating minority culture and showcasing the students\u2019 work from all the project meetings3) A blog where all the project activities will remain accessible also after the completion of the projectImpact & long-term benefits Those who participate in the project are expected to gain a deeper understanding of their own language and cultural heritage. They will also learn about other minority cultures and the threats they are facing in today\u2019s society and thereby become better prepared for how to solve these issues in the future. In the long term, everyone involved in the project will become champions of languages and minorities. In other words, they will start to appreciate their minority culture and language more because they are aware of the relationship between their cultural heritage and their identity. Similarly, they will start to show more respect for other people\u2019s rights to do this too and thereby be less critical when it comes to immigrants and asylum seekers who want to promote their own cultural heritage and keep some of their own traditions and customs. This will make it possible for a majority and minority culture(s) to successful co-exist. In addition, the participants will increase their intercultural competence, English language skills and their ability to do research, analyse results and think critically.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-FI01-KA219-022664_3"]]}}}}
