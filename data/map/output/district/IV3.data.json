However, there are many major scientific, technological and social obstacles to overcome. This European Joint Master proposes specialised training in this field. The consortium is composed of three universities: University of the Highlands and Islands - Scottish Association for Marine Science (Scotland, UK), University of Crete (Greece) and the University of Nantes (France). The first semester (SAMS/UHI, UK) is devoted to gaining an overview of the global aquaculture industry, the interactions of this industry with the environment, and the new technologies and systems designed to address the various challenges and opportunities associated with this industry. In addition, there will be an opportunity to attend a 10 day optional overseas fieldtrip at the end of semester 1. Whereas the two following trimesters are devoted to acquiring more specialist knowledge in the finfish and shellfish industries, the fourth semester is targeted to an industry-based research project, resulting in the writing of a dissertation (30 ECTS credits). The first 3 semesters comprise 9 modules (including two core modules and one optional) from a choice of two modules in each country. Each module includes up to 250 hours and is worth 10 ECTS credits.Career prospectsThe objectives and format of the course mean that ACES graduates will be equipped to work in senior management roles in a wide range of settings, including fin and shell-fish farms, environmental and regulatory organisations, international trade organisations, and nongovernmental organisations. Close links with the aquaculture industry and legislators are central to this course. Course objectives explicitly promote the interests of the industry and cooperation with other professionals. Expected career paths include company manager tasks, policy and strategy, aquaculture-related project development, applied research and jobs related to stakeholder partnership creation and promotion.An international experienceThe course runs over four semesters and involves study periods in three different European countries. This movement allows students to benefit from different welfare models, teaching strengths and the experience of living in different cultures and societies. ACES students have the opportunity to be taught by a team of international experts and gain the skills required to address food security \u2013an issue of global importance. More than 16 international partners cooperate with the programme hosting fieldtrips, providing international guest lecturers, organising placements and supporting research projects. Despite the courses being taught in English, language classes are also provided to ensure that students integrate as well as possible in socio-cultural terms in the host country.DiplomaSuccessful graduates will receive a Joint Master degree from the University of the Highlands and Islands and the University of Crete and a Single Degree from the University of Nantes in line with national legislation. In addition to these degree certificates, graduates will also receive a diploma supplement that outlines the nature of the course, curriculum and marking scheme.Websitehttp://www.sams.ac.uk/erasmus-master-aquaculture", "http://www.uhi.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS LBG", "erasmus_553648-EPP-1-2014-1-UK-EPPKA1-JMD-MOB_coordinator"], [2017, "Adventure tourism in vocational education and training", "UNIVERSITY OF THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS LBG", 320560.0, 3, 8, "Context\r\nTourism is a vital economic sector for many rural communities, particularly those located in regions of high natural value. The growth of tourism worldwide has in many instances led to the revitalisation of rural areas struggling with youth outmigration and decreasing job opportunities in traditional sectors. \r\nAdventure tourism has grown very rapidly worldwide in recent decades, leading to the establishment of new companies and new professional careers which are open both to young people and adults. All partner countries having thriving tourism sectors in their respective regions, as well as educational, innovation and research institutions dedicated to serving their regional communities. However, tourism operates in a very dynamic environment, with ever greater demands on SMEs; to stay competitive and to professionalise the tourism \u2018product\u2019, however, the sector is widely acknowledged as needing to improve its skill base\r\n\r\nObjective\r\nThe main objective of ADVENT (Adventure Tourism Vocational Education and Training) is to strengthen SMEs ability to meet such challenges through increased accessibility of educational and training programs. To do this, collaborative forums need to be created on a cross-sectoral level, with participation of both educational institutes and representatives of tourism SMEs. These forums will identify the educational needs of SMEs and design and develop courses appropriate to meeting them. \r\n\r\nThe Project Consortium\r\nADVENT involves three consortia, with eight partners, in Iceland, Finland and Scotland.  The project is led by FAS, a upper secondary school in southeast Iceland, working with the University of Iceland\u2019s Hornafjordur Regional Research Centre and the local destination management organisation (DMO), Visit Vatnaj\u00f6kull.\r\nIn Finland, the Department of Tourism and Sports at Kajaani University of Applied Sciences is working with the vocational school Kainuun ammattiopisto and Naturpolis, the regional business center in Kuasamo.\r\nThe lead Scottish partner is West Highland College.  A partner college of the University of the Highlands and Islands, it comprises two complementary departments: the School of Adventure Studies and the Centre for Recreation and Tourism Research (CRTR). It will work with the Lochaber Chamber of Commerce, the local DMO which brands the region as the Outdoor Capital of UK.\r\nThe project\u00b4s main target group is adult adventure tourism practitioners, both entrepreneurs and employees, but young students will also benefit from the educational initiatives undertaken. \r\n\r\nProject Activities\r\nThe project\u00b4s main activities involve the development and subsequent piloting of nine innovative study modules, three in each partner country. These will all be monitored and evaluated and then validated or accredited, as appropriate, by the educational institutes involved. The participants in these study modules will all be drawn from SMEs through the national forums in partner countries and thus over time lay the foundation for the creation of a community of practice. It is estimated that around 50-60 individuals will participate directly in project activities. \r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nThe project\u00b4s methodology is based on \u2018androgogy\u2019 and places particular emphasis on self-directed and experiential learning. The main results of the project will be new courses, developed in close cooperation with adventure tourism SMEs. These will become part of restructured programs at the educational institutes, targeting adult practitioners. Some study modules will also involve training experienced practitioners to become instructors, both on a peer-to-peer level and for young students. \r\n\r\nProject Impact\r\nThe impact of the project will mainly be felt at the local or regional level, in terms of upskilled local SMEs and young students, the development of new curricula, and through enhanced collaboration between the educational and business sectors. It should also lead to greater interest and motivation among young people in seeking jobs in the adventure tourism sector or starting up their own company. The transnational aspect of the project is highly important to its success and will be given strong attention. \r\n\r\nThe Legacy\r\nThe long-term sustainability of the project\u00b4s results will be ensured by incorporating the developed study modules into existing educational programs and also by restructuring the programs so they can be more responsive to the educational needs of adventure tourism SMEs. The project will furthermore lay the foundation for continued transnational cooperation between the partner countries, e.g. through new possibilities for student and staff mobility between countries. Finally, the long-term benefits of the project will also involve the creation of forums where different sectors can meet and collaborate on tasks that are vital to the sustainability of their local/regional communities, such as enhanced vocational education and training.", "http://www.uhi.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IS01-KA202-026524_1"], [2017, "Adventure Tourism Innovation Partnerships", "UNIVERSITY OF THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS LBG", 234912.0, 5, 6, "The Adventure Tourism Innovation Partnerships (AVIP) is transformative since it creates lasting impact for HEIs and their graduates, entrepreneurs and businesses, particularly SMEs and their employees; providing flexible learning pathways to enhance learners\u2019 digital and entrepreneurial skills, helping companies respond to the fast-changing adventure tourism environment. Research demonstrates that the HE/VET systems fails to adequately meet learner\u2019s skills needs and businesses are poorly equipped to respond to the transformational changes in tourism. AVIP responds directly to these concerns, offering flexible learning pathways and innovative collaborative delivery models \u2013 addressing low-skills through to higher levels skills provision \u2013 which address regional skills gaps and promote innovation.\r\n\r\nThe tourism industry is one of the largest in the world, accounting for 9% of global GDP. Europe is the world-leading tourist destination and the third largest economic activity in the European Union (9.9% of GDP, rising to 11% by 2026), employing over 25 million people.  Adventure tourism is one of its fastest growing segments growing exponentially year-on-year. ATTA estimated adventure tourism to be worth $263 Bn in 2013, growing at a rate of 195% in three years.\r\n\r\nAdventure tourism is widely recognised as a powerful tool that can promote sustainable growth, generating smart jobs, as well as providing strong incentives for conserving the natural environment. Indeed, Scotland\u2019s \u2018Tourism 2020\u2019 strategy identifies activities and adventure as having real growth potential. The strategy identifies the need to develop skills in a range of areas to support the industry\u2019s ambitions for growth, including: management and leadership; enabling high quality customer experiences; and ensuring the availability of appropriate training.\r\n\r\nYet our HE and VET systems \u2013 often operating in silos - are known to often lack the tools to effectively respond to the challenge. As Professor West, Chair of University Alliance states, \u201cto meet the increasing demand for higher-level skills we need multiple pathways through education, based on collaboration and partnership \u2013 we must not slip into the false divide between vocational and academic pathways\u201d. AVIP tackles this challenge head on; developing innovative partnerships and new models of HE based around highly malleable learning pathways, tailored to meet digital and entrepreneurial skills needed, empowering businesses to respond to growth opportunities within the adventure tourism economy. \r\n\r\nAVIP addresses The EU\u2019s 2020 Growth Strategy in three main ways. First, it promotes smart growth by fostering cooperation between H.E., VET institutions and employers; upskilling students and employees and generating quality jobs. Second, it promotes sustainable growth through promoting adoption of more efficient and innovative marketing measures and thirdly, it promotes inclusive growth, involving job creation in structurally disadvantaged locations as well as offering opportunities for low-skilled to develop new skills. \r\n\r\nAVIP also aligns with the European Tourism Manifesto for Growth and Jobs EU policy priorities, particularly in areas of  skills development, which encourages relationships between training/education providers and industry, and making lifelong learning training available online.\r\n\r\nThe aim is clear: Establish Innovation Partnerships to develop flexible learning pathways that enhance the capacity of businesses to capitalise on the opportunities within adventure tourism. To achieve this AVIP will pursue the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1, Innovation Partnerships and Frameworks HE, VET Institutions and businesses; collaborating to identify skills gaps, develop flexible learning pathways and exchange best practices for results-based pedagogy.\r\n2, Immersion in Digital Technologies. Partners introduce innovative training to transform graduate and SME capacity to digitise their business experience \r\n3, Innovating New Products. Learners will unleash their creative capacity through acquisition of commercialisation skills and competencies.   \r\n4, Open Online Collaboration Platform. An mobile platform promotes \u2018communities of learning\u2019; fostering transnational cooperation to speed up learning to improve innovation through a virtual cluster.   \r\n\r\nAVIP will have a range of impacts:\r\n1,  Innovation Partnerships enhance alignment of regional training systems to better meet the skills needs and exploit the opportunities of regional adventure tourism through innovative Flexible Learning Pathways.\r\n2, Entrepreneurs commercialise new products and services to enhance their competitiveness.\r\n3, Longer term benefits include wider adoption of our Innovation Partnerships and the HE  sector better understanding how to implement our innovative applied learning tools, impacting policy and practice at local, regional, national and international levels.", "http://www.uhi.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS LBG", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA203-036706_coordinator"], [2016, "Innovative, free, on and off line access modules to study master's courses in Europe", "UNIVERSITY OF THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS LBG", 213818.0, 4, 5, "The strategic partnership will design, develop, implement and evaluate innovative, free on- and off-line access modules to master's courses in Europe (we use the word 'course' for the entire 2-year education program and the word 'module' for the segments that comprise the course). The project is innovative in several ways: 1) The modules will be delivered via an innovative system which allows the student to visualise their skills and knowledge profile as it develops in comparison with those required to study the master's course2) The system is accessible both on- and off-line thereby increasing its accessibility3) The system is scalable and transferable4) The module is enhanced by the use of peer assessment providing a balanced view of a student\u2019s skills and knowledge5) The learning interventions, designed specifically for the module, will be made available as open educational resources6) The content of the module spans subject knowledge and academic and employability skills preparing the student for the master's course and for transition to employmentA pre-survey has shown that, in spite of that fact that many students have the formal prerequisites to register for master's courses, they lack skills or competences that European universities expect them to have. The access module will allow potential students, both national and international, to test if they have the necessary knowledge and skills (in addition to the formal requirements) to enter a desired master's course in Europe. If they do not, then the module will provide them with these knowledge and skills. (The potential students must also have the formal requirements to enter the course.) An Application Programme Interface (API) will connect the learning and assessment content and the assessment tool to Digital Connextions existing platform Hiryzr, for enhanced peer assessment, to provide students with the ability to identify and discover employability skills and employment opportunities. This will enable potential students to relate learning outcomes of the course material to their employability skills.For the Student, the system will:  1) Assess a student's existing skills and knowledge profile (including academic study and employability)2) Provide the student with a visualisation of their existing skills and knowledge as compared to those identified as necessary for study on the master's course3) Present the student with a series of learning interventions designed to develop the required knowledge and skills4) Invite the student to upload evidence of successful completion of the learning interventions5) Allow students to reassess their skills and knowledge after completing the learning interventions6) Permit other students (peers) or tutors to confirm or adjust skills and knowledge assessment, by reviewing the evidence the student has uploaded7) Provide the student with a 'post intervention' visualisation of their new skills and knowledge profile8) Provide the student with an option to compare their profile with employment opportunities available after completion of the master's courseFor the University the system will:1) Be discoverable and accessible via a web link on the University's webpage2) Be administered by each University3) Be housed in a secure Amazon server in accordance to each country's data protection laws  4) Support multiple languages (English in the first instance)5) Be integrated with a University\u2019s Virtual Learning Environment6) Provide the University with a range of analytics related to a student's progress through the access module7) Provide the University with competent students for the master's courseThe pedagogical approach is innovative in its own right. It is inspired by existing approaches such as asynchronous self-directed learning, where students choose their own pathway through the learning presented to them without tutor input. The learning interventions will be designed to promote enquiry based learning where students take an active approach, developing knowledge and transferable skills such as the ability to undertake critical review and, a key employability skill, digital literacy.The project results will be widely disseminated so that the system can be extended and used by other European institutions. The techniques used to develop the access module can readily be used to develop similar modules for other levels of education and for courses given in other languages.

The increase has been about 20% annually over the last 3 years. But tourism is not just increasing in Iceland, other countries seem to be experiencing the same trend, making the need for diversity in education for people working in the field of tourism urgent. \r\n\u2022 Another issue, equally important, that will be addressed is the high turnover of people working in the field of tourism. This is a known fact that has the disadvantage for the companies of always having to train new people with additional cost in both time and money.  Study made by the Icelandic Tourist Board has shown the need for shorter education programs for people with limited education, working in the field. These programs would encourage them to stay in the industry by focusing on developing professional, communicational and inter-cultural skills and thereby anchoring workers in this rapidly growing industry. \r\n\u2022 Although tourism education has an established history, it has not been as common to focus on the less educated people working in the field at any given time. Also when it comes to developing the curriculum, the conversation with the industry (i.e. the companies working in the field) regarding what they really need, is sometimes missing. Therefore the main focus will be on involving the companies working in the tourist industry with the project as a direct participant in developing a program for people working in the field of tourism. One of the main issue to address is to develop a program that can be added to a full-time workers current schedule. The program should educate and enhance current skills and therefore increase job satisfaction. This collaboration will enable their current staff to participate in the program courses; first in the pilot project and after that, the continuous program. To do this we want to use as a part of our teaching methods the PBL model \u201cproblem based learning\u201d. It is a new and innovative way of approaching the material as well as the students, as it engages them in challenging problems and encourages them to work collaboratively towards their solution. In relation to other projects carried out, all the participants except UCSI in Iceland, are currently running tourism education programs at their organizations although all with very different approach.  \r\n\u2022 The University Centre of the South (Iceland) is the project coordinator and the project leader is a D-certified MPM, currently preparing his masters dissertation and will use the progress and result of this project as material for that thesis.   \r\nBoth partners chosen by the Icelandic coordinators/UCSI come from well-known education establishments. Both the University of Malaga and the University of Highlands and Islands run high quality tourism education courses at BS and MA level. \r\n\u2022 The first IO will be to establish a concrete platform in each country that includes members from the industry. The aim is to use this platform for sharing ideas on best practices and decide on the most relevant topics to focus on. This platform will provide an overview of current situation in each participating country, mapping the potential programs to best reach the people working in the tourist industry. \u2022 The second IO will be a fully qualified and tested teaching program of the \u201cone year diploma course for people working in the tourism industry\u201d ready for the project partners to continue teaching as well as all other interested educational organizations. \u2022 The third IO will be two peer reviewed articles about the progress and work performed in the project. Both articles will be written after the pilot program has finished and will emphasize on the conclusion of the project, its dissemination and its prospect for sustainability as stated in the projects full report. Both articles will include Erasmus+ sponsorship information and disclaimer. \u2022 In terms of methodology we believe that by establishing a platform with relevant companies in the tourism industry in each region participating in the project, we will open up the dialogue between the industry and education organizations. \r\nBy running a pilot program, the alliance of educators and industry will be sealed even further. The industry will send their staff to partake in the pilot program and through the platform monitor the work. The courses run in the pilot program will educate and enhance current skills and therefore increase job satisfaction. That should eventually reduce staff turnover and make the industry more stable. \u2022 This project will educate workers currently working in the tourist field, in close collaboration with the companies. We believe that with the work done in this project, we can meet these workers where the need is. This will in return get the employees more committed to the companies they work for witch will result in higher service level and reduce staff turnover and increase the industries profit.", "http://www.uhi.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IS01-KA202-013169_1"], [2018, "Shetland Islands to Norway - Enhancing Employability and Developing Life Skills", "UNIVERSITY OF THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS LBG", 40046.0, 2, 2, "This project focuses on vocational practices in the Shetland Islands, Scotland, and Voss, Norway, and stems from the view that international learning can increase the quality of young people's education in general and in particular in relation to vocational training.

ARCH programmes have seen over 1,000 learners from a wide range of government and non-governmental organisations within Scotland visit a variety countries within Europe to learn about the different ways in which new skills and competencies in nature conservation and cultural heritage interpretation can be delivered.  \r\nNature Exchange Two (NET) aims to provide adult learner participants with a focused, ready-made opportunity to take time out from their every-day work to learn about how conservation, education and interpretation work is undertaken elsewhere in Europe and give them an opportunity to consider new ways of working.  \r\nNET  will collaborate with partners throughout Europe from Iceland and Norway in the north to Cyprus and Bulgaria in the south. The aim is to develop knowledge exchange trips (typically of 8-10 days) that focus on the management of our natural and cultural heritage.  NET is developed around the priority areas of work within natural and cultural heritage, conservation interpretation and education in Scotland today.  Each training visit will be associated with a broad theme, which will provide a focus for activities through the week.  Emphasis will be placed on exchange of knowledge, ideas, issues and solutions between the participants and hosts. Informal talks by participants on their work in Scotland and challenges they face, as well as talks from the hosts, encouraging focused discussion on how both participants and hosts can benefit from each other\u2019s knowledge and experiences and how they can  build this into ongoing adult education courses.  \r\nAs in previous years, we will work with our partners to develop adult education training placements, which focus on new skills and knowledge and have the capacity for the exchange of best practice that fits with participants needs. For example in Germany the programme will focus on the wildcat and on preserving and managing its habitat, In Iceland the focus will be interpretive techniques for understanding and conserving the cultural landscape, including the traditional skills of turf building. In Finland and Slovakia the programme theme is forest schools and environmental education.  In Norway the themes are large mammal management, fishery management, predator control and balancing hunting and conservation interests.\r\nOur partners all  share our aim of providing high quality and innovative vocational training.  Receiving partners have been chosen because they are recognised by the UK consortium as being able to provide examples of best practice in the key areas identified as most important for our Scottish practitioners to learn. What they offer has the potential to be built into adult education, both formal and informal. \r\nNET participants will be drawn from the 14 member organisations in the ARCH mobility consortium which includes Scottish Natural Heritage, RSPB, National Trust for Scotland, Forestry Commision Scotland  and John Muir Trust all of whom have a remit to manage and protect Scotland\u2019s natural and cultural heritage through conservation, interpretation and education.
