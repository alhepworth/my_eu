I would like to bring more experience of the French way of life into our lessons, and to set up a link between our pupils (year 9 and 10 and possibly year 12 at College) and those from a French school. And I know that this is much easier to achieve through direct contact between staff from each school.  I hope that I will be able to learn new and interesting ways to meet my pupils\u2019 needs, especially through the target language.\r\nI am very keen on using new technologies in the classroom. I plan all my lessons on the interactive whiteboard (smartboard) and I run training sessions for my colleagues at Alton College. I have recently introduced Pinterest, the use of image in the classroom (humour, colour, films and clear grammar notes)  and I keep developing my teaching through the ideas from blogs I have discovered in Pinterest. I also reinforce my teaching with youtube.  I would like to share this knowledge with my French partners and also learn from them.\r\nThe impact of this project will also be to  increase the motivation of students to use language with a purpose and enable them to communicate with French youngsters.\r\nIn a near future I would like to teach in another European country, possibly France or an International school in England or Europe and this project will enhance my mobility and chances to succeed.", "http://www.ameryhill.hants.sch.uk", "Amery Hill School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013173_coordinator"]]}}, "2QJ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Regionalisierung, Nationalisierung und Internationalisierung von Unternehmen III", "Testo Ltd", 49599.0, 7, 16, "This project is suited for trainees as industrial clerks or trainees in wholesale and foreign trade with the additional qualification \u201cEuropean Business Management with foreign languages\u201c in the area of the Chamber of Commerce \u201dS\u00fcdlicher Oberrhein\u201d.
