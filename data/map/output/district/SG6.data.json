The interplay between materials researchers, technology developers and end users allows to generate solutions quickly and effectively with minimum investment and time and to achieve maximum output with minimum risk.

There are three main families of methods: Polymerase Chain Reaction, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and nano-particles agglutination techniques. All these methods suffer from several disadvantages as they are time-consuming and expensive, they are not quantitative and exclude multiplexing, i.e. the detection of different genotypes simultaneously. The need of a new multiplexing and quantitative bioassay technique is evident. The aim of this project is to develop a high sensitivity multiplexed platform based on a bio-non bio nanostructure able to enhance diagnostic capabilities by exploiting the dimensional shift from bio-systems to nanometric particles, thus overcoming many of the limitations of the existing methods. This method could be adapted to the detection of many kinds of bio-systems, but the project will focus on Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) responsible for cancer. The project idea is based on the development of nanoparticles functionalised with probes complementary to HPV DNA conservative region and an array of specific bio-probes for the different HPV genotypes deposited on a solid substrate. The nanoparticles will bind to the bio-system and then they will diffuse through the suspension docking to the area of the array where the probe specific for that genotype is coated.

In several national elections the extreme right and /or openly xenophobic parties have gained substantive support. Re-build Refuge Europe\u2019s objective is to counteract this discourse and beliefs. It builds on creative cultural proposals and offers spaces for processes of co-creation to be developed, in which refugees and migrants are considered as a constitutive part of the remaking of European communities. Actions to support the recent incomers are mushrooming all over Europe, often focussing by necessity on aid, social and economic support. We believe that it is the cultural role of Europe to welcome refugees properly and to allow, give the space for cultural hybridisation to happen. We believe that only by fully realising the potential of cultural hybridisation and by being a welcoming and supportive area will Europe build a secure society for its future, inside and outside its borders. The project Re-build refuge Europe provides the space to link up cultural actors and societal actors mobilised in different corners of Europe to exchange and build new practices.

Manifesto for rebuilding Europe from the bottom up\" (www.manifest-europa.eu). \r\n\r\nWithin the framework of Erasmus+ Youth in Action and based on the manifesto the project reaches out for the following objectives:\r\n(1) the inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities that are so far underrepresented in European voluntary services\r\n(2) the involvement of and outreach to further stakeholders to engage in EVS in order to enlarge the capacities of volunteer programmes in Europe; as well as, \r\n(3) the promotion of EVS, and specifically the idea of a more inclusive EVS, by using a widespread communication and dissemination strategy.  \r\n\r\nDuring this pilot project, experienced EVS organisations and third parties (foundations and civil society organizations who are active in the sector of European and national voluntary services) from 6 European countries will build long-term partnerships in order to exchange best practices and pool resources, experience and skills in the domain of social and mobility inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities. \r\nBased on prior experiences and an extensive analysis, the partner organisations will set up common quality criteria for the inclusion of the target group in cross-border voluntary services. \r\n\r\nAs a first step and pilot testing stage, the experienced voluntary partner organisations will set up together 12 short-term voluntary services of 2 weeks (blended learning activities) for young volunteers and mentors, which take into account the specific needs of persons with fewer opportunities. The mentors will receive training beforehand in order to get to know the hosting projects and to plan carefully the use of digital learning for the short term voluntary services during the preparation, implementation and evaluation of the activities. The results will lead to the creation of a practical guide about how to use digital learning to support the learning processes of the target group in volunteer activities.\r\nAs a second step, the individual experiences will be analysed and evaluated carefully by all partner organisations in order to draw conclusions and to design together new European volunteer activities which take into account the experiences and findings and which involve the foundations actively into the upcoming projects. The involvement of the third parties will be looked at individually based on each organisation\u2019s needs and possibilities. The project will be combined in this phase with further key action 1 EVS activities applied by the EVS partner organisations of the consortium. \r\nAt least 24 pilot EVS activities (3 to 6 months) for young people with fewer opportunities will be prepared, implemented and evaluated accordingly, involving all partners.

Both countries can represent important examples of successful models of self-reliance, improvisation skills and capacity to deal with lack of public funding for youth work. At the same time, Europe can provide much needed expertise in professionalization and transparency dialogue with policy processes. However, Brazilian as much as Chinese youth are demanding participation and influence by engaging in their communities, running and founding NGOs and CSOs - a trend that should be encouraged and reinforced. The EU history of youth programs and organisations is here an important precedent in the promotion of voluntary learning achievements and the advancement of an active civil society, representing a best practice for both China and Brazil as they face challenges of professionalization and increased pressure to demonstrate results.Against this background of challenges and opportunities and building on its multi-year experience in the three regions and the wide network of partners and local supporters that it has developed, this consortium of grassroots NGOs, mid-level institutions, informal groups and public authorities active in the youth, cultural and creative fields across the three areas, propose to develop and implement innovative models for youth work in order to challenge unsustainable youth unemployment and of youth at risk of social marginalisation. This project will develop a set of practical tools, case-studies, and pilot schemes for the improvement, empowerment, and innovation of youth work models and policies in two focus areas, the first resulting in higher conversion rates of youth programs in self-sufficient and labour-creating youth initiatives, the second in realistically reaching out to youth groups at risk of social marginalisation.The activities, which will span across Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom), China and Brazil within a timeframe of 18 months, include: extensive research and production, aimed at fostering the availability of transferrable information on best practices and successful models across the EU, China, and Brazil; youth workers mobility, aimed at capacity building and direct implementation of project findings; disseminating activities, aimed at expanding the outreach of production and findings.", null, "EUROPEAN ALTERNATIVES LIMITED LBG", "erasmus_559038-EPP-1-2014-2-UK-EPPKA2-CBY-ACPALA_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "EUROPEAN ALTERNATIVES LIMITED LBG*EUROALTER", 174450.0, "Europe for citizens \u2014 Strengthening remembrance and enhancing capacity for civic participation at the Union level (18.04.01.01)", "fts_2017_39817"], [2016, "EUROPEAN ALTERNATIVES LIMITED LBG*EUROALTER", 162379.0, "Europe for citizens \u2014 Strengthening remembrance and enhancing capacity for civic participation at the Union level (18.04.01.01)", "fts_2016_39911"], [2017, "EUROPEAN ALTERNATIVES LIMITED LBG*EUROALTER", 328.0, "Other management expenditure (18.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_44112"]]}}}}
