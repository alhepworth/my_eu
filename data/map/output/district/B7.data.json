The aim of this initiative which has been extended to other school types in upper secondary education is to improve the intercultural competence of staff and put a wider emphasis on European values and ideas. Furthermore, a wide knowledge of methods of teaching and pedadogical developments is also of great importance. As the Landesschulrat is in the process of being restructured into a body called \"Bildungsdirektion\" another aim of this years' project is to study administrative and legal structures in partner countries. That is why we are glad that we were able to include educational boards in the region of Toulouse, France, and Lund, Sweden as partners. These partners will be visisted by our school inspectors and other representatives of our board of education.\r\n\r\nThe first basic steps to improve intercultural competence is to improve language competences, English being the prime but not the only target language.\r\n Emphasis has been put on finding partners in France as the interest in French has drastically dropped in Austria. As a result of job shadowings in France  stratetic partnerships with French partners are expected to increase and make French especially attractive to students. \r\nGood working knowledge of English is also required for teachers who work with CLIL. In order to teach their subjects in English, they need to be fluent and competent themselves. Great interest in improving English skills has been expressed by all of the consortium members. All participants appreciate the opportunity to take part in European Union funded English courses.\r\nHowever, not only language skills need to be developed and practiced. Exchanging knowledge and upgrading skills is important in all fields. That is why several teachers have already expressed interest in taking part in courses offered on the School Education Gateway. Others have working partnerships in other countries and have been invited to job-related courses in Portugal.\r\n\r\nA second factor of equal importance is building or extending a network of partner institutions in other countries. Several of the participating institutions have long standing partnerships with schools in various countries, like Sweden, Germany, France, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the Czech Republic.
