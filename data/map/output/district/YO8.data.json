The co-innovation approach will allow tacit and scientific knowledge to be applied to real-world challenges in plant team cropping for developing practical solutions, in the form of teams with improved productivity, pest and disease control and environmental benefits.

This is achieved via: a true multi-actor approach that balances environmental, economic- and social-securities by minimising environmental impact; optimising diversity and resilience in commercial and environmental terms throughout the supply chain; and delivery of excellent nutrition to ensure the highest possible states of health and wellbeing for people and animals.

The platform is based on the integration of proprietary technologies available to the consortium partners: an automatic water concentration cartridge combined with a microfluidic cell will provide an adequate sample to a newly designed fluorescence image cytometer whose readings will be recorded and processed using a proper software interface. It will be validated for quantifying Legionella and Escherichia coli (E. coli) population within 120 minutes from obtaining the sample, overcoming in this way the main disadvantage of traditional methods used in laboratories, i.e. long time-to results which can currently last up to 12 days in the case of Legionella and 1 day for E. coli. The targeted detection limit will be 10-100 cells/L and 5-20 cells/100 mL for Legionella and E.coli, respectively. Also, the new imaging cytometer will have a portable form, a size similar to a smart-phone, which will increase its versatility and widen the possibilities of onsite applications. The relevance of the project is clear when one thinks about the high risk of legionellosis in some specific industrial environments, such as cooling waters, evaporative condensers and air conditioning systems and the fact that E. coli is one of the faecal pollution index commonly analyzed for monitoring the presence of waterborne pathogens and hence the quality of bathing waters.

Content creation is a dimension of the European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens. With our project \"The future teacher 3.0 as a bridge to accessible and customised adult education\" the aim is to prepare the teachers for adult education right now as well as in the future. The Future teacher 3.0 must be an online critical thinker, creator, communicator, collaborator, facilitator.Our project provides an answer to the following priorities of the European Commission \u2713Extending and developing educators competences\u2713Designing and implementing effective provision for enhancing the basic skills and key competences\u2713Improve achievement in relevant and high-level basic and transversal competences in a lifelong learning perspectiveIn our project we want to focus on ICT competences of teachers in adult education  as an essential and differentiated requirement first but also on effective teaching and learning by using ICT. At the moment for many teachers ICT is one-way exchange of information but this needs to change to reflect much more collaboration and use of newer and more efficient methods of communication. All partners feel that these priorities are crucial in order to guarantee the quality of our education and provide their learners the best (accessable) education possible. We need to make sure that our indirect target group, students, pupils, adults\u2026receive high quality education in a way that encourages technology-confident learning. The project's main focus is on teachers in adult education but the aims and planned outputs will certainly be transferable to all levels of education. During the project we will indicate throughout where and how the information, resources and activities are transferable to all levels of education.The partners will support and educate teachers and educational staff in digital competences and improving the use of ICT for inclusive learning and related digital competences. Our partnership wants to develop different tools and skills that promote access to (and learning through) Open Educational Resources but crucially OER that can be easily re-purposed and re-shared rather than just shared for consumption. We develop the measurement tool \"The Digital Thermometer\u201d, this thermometer provides the user an indication how their compentences are at the start and how they are improving. Based on their Digital Thermometer the users (teacher) will get a Digital Compass.  This can be a program for beginners or also for the more advanced users.  They will have a range of mandatory and a range of optional modules and nano-lessons in the 3 languages. Based on the results of the Digital Thermometer we will create a list with content we have to develop in the Digital Journey. Duting this project we\u2019ll create 20 content modules with in each module 3 nano-lessons, assignments, video's, learning paths, e-pub, sound and video.   Per module, the participant needs two hours to read the content and do the assignments. If the participants want to practice also within their own lessons, we expect that they need 3 hours extra per module to do that. Through out the whole project we like our target group to create online materials, share those materials and reuse the materials that others made. During the project we learn our adult teacher target group how to use the different OER\u2019s in the different countries, how to share and how to reuse. For that purpose we have to create learning materials, manuals and nano-modules and educate them during their Digital Journey. At the end of this project all the tools and materials will be available for all teachers and we hope that they also benefit from this. All partners will keep promoting this also after the project is finished. The expected impact for the partners is to enable far more teachers to develop high quality, accessible interactive content for use with their learners and supporting the development of the current and future teaching profession. The project partners will share the project results and will keep on supporting their target groups in implementing distance and blended learning. Benefits of this project on the long term:\u2713 Increase of the digital literacy of teachers\u2713 More effective support to teachers\u2713 Increase of an innovating, professional learning culture within schools\u2713 A lot of learning resources available for everyone for free\u2713 Sharing and re-using learning materials by teachersThe project's focus is on teachers in adult education but the exhausts is certainly transferable to all levels of education.
