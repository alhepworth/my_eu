The dairy industry is an important food industry sector with sales of \u20ac124.3 billion and added value of \u20ac17.4 billion p.a. It is a high energy and water consumer, both overall and per unit production: up to 6.47 MWh (5.55 MWhth and 0.92 MWhel) and 60 m3 of water per tonne processed milk. 98 % of the fresh water used is of drinking water quality with 80% of energy consumed in process heating, pasteurisation, sterilisation, drying and cleaning operations.  During EnReMilk, energy savings of at least 20% and water savings of at least 30% will be achieved in case studies (3 months production), replicable in both SME and larger dairies. These savings will be validated against a consumption baseline of existing operation, being validated in model simulations and in physical trials. Emerging and novel engineering technologies will be optimised and implemented in key dairy unit operations to provide significant and simultaneous saving of water and energy, while ensuring food quality and safety. It will:  (i) identify and monitor water and energy consumption patterns of along the entire supply chain, (ii) model and simulate to evaluate savings potential of a vast array of technological scenarios, (iii) optimise selected technologies in case studies with highest water and energy saving potential, (iv) optimise resource supply and use strategies, and (v) ensure benefits for food producers and equipment manufacturers, while reconciling sustainability imperatives. It will ensure a smooth translation into practical implementation, providing an innovation-driven increase in the competitiveness of the EU dairy sector. EnReMilk will ensure that engineering innovations are verified as environmentally sustainable, economically viable and socially responsible, and that food quality and safety is not compromised.", 247586.0, 5791078.0, 6, 16, "ENREMILK", "http://www.enremilk.eu/", null, null, "fp7_111424_985410294"], [1377993600000, 1440979200000, "Demonstration of a novel microwave processing application for nutritional and shelf stable milk", "Dantech Uk Ltd", "The MicroMilk project (Grant Agreement Number: 262603) funded by the R4SME programme (call identifier: FP7-SME-2010-1) delivered high quality science and technology development. MicroMilk involved the RTD of a novel process to facilitate cost-effective, energy efficient and flexible processing of a wide range of different milk variants, including those with high viscosities with minimum start-up and shut-down,  minimal surface fouling and therefore less cleaning efforts and water being wasted. A novel continuous microwave milk pasteurization system was successfully developed and validated. The results showed that heating times are 3 times shorter than state of the art indirect heating. Both the indirect and microwave heating result in comparable microbiological, physico-chemical and sensory quality (experimental & commercial). This confirmed that microwave pasteurisation is suited for the commercial production and distribution of drinking milk.\nThe developed cavity reactor was integrated into a standard milk pasteurization plant, including CIP cleaning and full energy recovery. An industrial scale unit has been designed and specified. Further demonstration at industrial sites to confirm long-term performance, operational costs and economic viability must be undertaken. These include industrialisation of manufacturing processes to enable economies of scale to be achieved. The consortium has identified a number of market opportunities and is keen to bring this development into an industrial stage.", 230794.0, 1470964.0, 4, 7, "MICROMILK-DEMO", null, null, null, "fp7_110501_985410294"], [1288569600000, 1351641600000, "Nutritional and shelf stable milk by novel microwave processing", "Dantech Uk Ltd", "We are a consortium of European SMEs that has identified a promising low energy, time efficient and easy to clean microwave milk processing system that can improve nutritional value and taste of milk and milk products due to shorter heating times required to reach the holding temperatures during heating. Microwave heating will enhance the advantages of UHT (Ultra High Temperature) milk by improving the nutritional and organoleptic quality, comparable to \u201cfresh\u201d HTST (High Temperature Short Time) pasteurised and ESL (Extended shelf life) conventionally-treated milks. The novel system will also increase the shelf life of microwave-treated HTST and ESL milks by reducing the risk of contamination via equipment. Currently most used technology is heating by plate heat exchangers, which requires a cleaning in place system to be used quite often because of milk layers burning at the surfaces of the equipments, leading to increased shut down time. The milk industry aims at reducing the cleaning time of milk processing plants to increase the production time. Therefore, one of the major advantages of the MicroMilk system is the rapid achievement of retention temperature by direct interaction of milk with microwaves; resulting in easier cleanability with subsequent reduction of cleaning time and the minimisation of contamination sources via equipment. Objectives: Create an electro-thermal model of microwave cavity to enable controlled and uniform heating; Design, simulate, optimize and develop a demo-system at 60 l/h; Enhance the microbiological, nutritional and organoleptic quality and the shelf life of milk; Reduce the cleaning time and minimise the contamination sources of milk via equipment; Full HACCP and GMP compliance; Decrease cost of milk treatment from \u20ac1,200/tonne with state of the art systems to less than \u20ac1,000/tonne, leading the SME participants to &gt; \u20ac18million in shared profit within five years after the end of this project.", 120007.0, 1113662.0, 4, 8, "MICROMILK", "http://www.micromilk.fraunhofer.eu/", null, null, "fp7_96988_985410294"]]}}}}
