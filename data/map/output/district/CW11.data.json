This project proposal leads to knowledge transfer among partners in order to develop innovative e-textile products for interactive protective clothing and footwear using welding technologies by bringing experts from different countries, sectors and disciplines together to focus their effort in innovative e-textile product designs. \nWithin this context, the project aims to develop novel e-textile structures including transmission lines, sensors, actuators, microprocessors, personalized algorithms, on-body computing and user feedbacks in order to make a breakthrough towards development of interactive protective clothing and footwear that able to monitor health, activity, position of the user in the environmental risky situations, the welding technologies will be mainly used in three concepts:\nI.\tDesigning of transmission lines of e-textile structures; \nII.\tIntegration of electronic elements (different sensors, actuators, microprocessors, data transmission and power supply systems) to textile structures; \nIII.\tDesign and development of whole e-textile system for protective clothing applications including interactive protective garments and shoes.\nThus, project draws on strong transitions of textiles, electronics and informatics researches and is internationally acknowledged for its pioneering contributions to e-textile researches through the industry-academia cooperation.

Spectra is one of only three software packages certified by the English National Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Screening Programme. It has benefitted screening providers by seamless integration with patient records and ability to monitor over time. Providers reported improved throughput and attendance.  \nSpectra highlights much more than just DR. In deployments to date, over 50% of urgent eye clinic referrals are for suspected non-diabetic retinopathies. Thus, Spectra detects reliable biomarkers for many conditions. The greatest causes of blindness (after cataracts) are glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and DR. Spectra can detect early and treatable stages of these diseases, in particular low-pressure glaucoma missed by ocular pressure tests.

There is a need for Accent MEH to address progression and legacy programmes and a need for the Czech Republic and Danish partners to build links with local primary schools, through the establishment of a tuition programme modelled on the English National Curriculum and English Whole Class Vocal and Instrumental Tuition Strategy. Through the participation by key colleagues in a reciprocal visit to Warrington and Nachod in 2016, and the strength of the current partnership between Charanga and Denmark, it has been identified that each partner has a great deal to learn from the practices of the other, and that the development of these practices will have the impact to be realised locally, regionally,nationally and internationally.\r\nThe project will involve primary age children and we will track progress over 3 years. Accent  MEH will study the way in which children in Nachod learn Music Theory and Musicianship and transpose this into a new Music IT Programme which will be commissioned by Charanga (a nationally recognised  English company in the field of digital Music education) for use in Warrington, Halton  and Nachod  and Danish classrooms.\r\nCzech colleagues from our partner organisation (Arts School Police nad Metuji) will learn the fundamental pedagogy linked to the successful delivery of Music tuition to whole classes of children, and link with 1 regional primary schools in order to devise a teaching programme, which will track musically gifted and talented children and generally raise standards in the delivery of Music education.\r\nIt is hoped that outcomes will lead to children being able to articulate their thoughts about Music both verbally and through writing / appraising, which will lead to increased standards in the use of English in both countries. English children aren\u2019t exposed to the Czech language or culture and we hope to address this by incorporating folk songs and nationalist compositions into the project.

The aim is to achieve this within a one year time frame.    To achieve this, we plan to train our own staff to a proficiency level that will give them the competencies and confidence to deliver to our two mixed age classes.  Currently the four staff lack confidence to deliver the requirement s of the new curriculuum.  We choose to use our own staff as we believe this enables the children to experience the teaching not only in designated lessons but throughout the school day in many ways.  Our own staff are already highly skilled in other key aspects of outstanding teaching including behaviour management.  Our experience informs us that our children respond more positively to known adults and a teacher visiting once a week to deliver a lesson does not have the required relationship to achieve the best attainment and progress.  Our project will be given high priority and the development plan and process we plan to implement the project through is the same as the one we would use for high profile subjects such as English and maths.   Our first priority will be to deliver high quality immersion training to a group of four staff to develop their own language competency ,knowledge of effective methodology and cultural awareness.   We will then provide continuous peer and external professional development support.  On return from the course the participants will contribute to develop the schools, policy and  curriculum planning.  The wider school community including senior leader, governors and parents will be kept well informed and able to monitor and evaluate our progress with the project.  \r\n\r\nTopic based learning will be planned and delivered in a creative and engaging way.  Children will know what they are learning and be able to apply the knowledge and skills taught so that they and their teachers are able to measure attainment and progress in language learning and to identify next steps.  Assessments will be tracked and analyses and used to further improve outcomes.   The school anticipates the quality of the planned project will ensure teaching is at least good and outcomes meet or exceed national expectations. \r\n\r\nThe long term benefit of the project will be that we introduce children from a more deprived backgrounds to new learning and give them opportunities and aspirations for the future that may or may not otherwise be on offer to them.  They will transfer to their next phase of education with confidence and possibly develop languages as an area of strength.
