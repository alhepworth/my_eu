In this case, the student is an active component of a learning model focused on improving competence . The project \"Designing School New Perspectives\" is a tool implemented by the Piano Nazionale Scuola Digitale (Digital School National Project), since it aims at increasing the individual competencies of \u2018\u2019digital animators\u2019\u2019, who are professionals working in this field.The digital animators will be a catalyst within their schools, experimenting and optimizing active didactic methods not only to acquire the competencies required of them by the work and social worlds, but also for students to develop social consciousness, entrepreneurship, and proactivity. The Project:\u2022 moves from an analysis of the local needs, through an extensive survey;\u2022 provides the participants with advanced training programs. These are models of active didactics, based on environments that enhance the use of technology in didactics, through Job Shadowing and training courses in other European countries;\u2022 re-elaborates experiences to fit the context of Italian teachers and technicians;\u2022 monitors the effects in school;\u2022 spreads experimentations and outcomes validated not only in school networks, but also all over the territory.The learning outcomes from the re-elaboration of formative experiences will bring about benefits and changes in the learning environments of all the schools taking part in the project. Also, they will be useful for the implementation of new policies both on a national and European scale, which is closely related to the changes brought about globally by technology information.The formation of a \"community of practice\" by the participants will surely have to be recognized among the results of the project. It will be extended to all stakeholders, within which they are able to share knowledge on computational thinking, on flipped classroom and \"backward design\u2019\u2019, i.e. varying skills. The goal is to optimize the use of resources made available by the digital world.Teachers (both in humanities and scientific subjects in primary and secondary schools) directors and technicians participate in the mobility plan; all 30 participants are involved in the Digital School National Plan.The dissemination will be implemented and supported by a concrete evaluation plan throughout the project life.Sustainability will be ensured through distance training processes after the end of the period for which the project will be financed.It will be possible to extend the training processes to the partnerships Erasmus Plus KA2, both in school and in the VET sector, for an international sharing of teaching methods with the use of ICT.", "http://www.newburyparkschool.net", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA101-023342_1"]]}}, "7PQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "A Taste of Europe", "Oaks Park High School", 41497.0, 3, 3, "\"A taste of Europe\" has the intention to set up a strategic school partnership of three schools mainly focusing on the subjects science, nutrition and ethics. \"Food\" is the base for the project - it is an essential part of every country\u00b4s culture and identity and can easily be used to build bridges between cultures and also to understand cultural differences.  Taking the title literally the ATE project will provide the chance for students from different European countries the chance to be part of international cooperation and interdependet working processes. Accordng to the participating schools\u00b4 focus and facilities the schools will rotational take the lead for working processes. The project is based on the idea of interdependet and interdisciplinary work and will include a wide range of subjects, such as science, business studies, nutrition, philosophy and psychology, geography, arts, religious education, IT, etc.\r\n\r\n\"FOOD\" is a topic that can be worked on from many different points of view - starting from science (e.g. genetic modified food, food chemistry) via nutrition (e . g. quality of food) via business studies (e.g. new consumer trends) to philosphy (ethical aspects). We plan to work on the topic combining theoretical aspects with practical aspects. We aim to have a closer look to \"Europe on a plate\"  which will have long term impacts on students, teachers and school management of all participating schools. \r\n\r\nThe ATE project is a cooperation of three European schools, alll experienced in international cooperation. Additional to the continuous interdependent work each school has its special focus and abilities that will lead to unique contributions to the project:\r\n\r\nHLW St. Veit (Austria): a vocational school of tourism and commerce located in the rural south of Austria offers its approximately 500 students a wide range of education and training for future university studies or employment. The two streams are the Three Year Course in Office Management and Tourism  and the Five Year Course in Commerce and Tourism.  Additional qualifications include several language certificates as well as extracurricular gastronomy courses. In 2014 HLW St. Veit has achieved the official status of a \"COOL\" School. Austria will contribute its competences and equipment of the fields of open learning methods, gastronomy and sustainability.\r\n\r\nRegius College Schagen (Netherlands):  Higher General Secondary Education and pre-university education,  located in the North of the Netherlands it offers approximately 1500 students from age 14 to 19 a wide range of education and training for future college and university studies. The Higher general Secondary Education takes five years to complete whereas pre-university education will take six years. Their curriculum depends on which profile they have chosen. The Netherlands will contribute their special competences about religious and ethical aspects of nutrition an health.\r\n\r\nOaks Park High School (UK): located in the North of London Oaks Park High School is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic comprehensive school of 1500 students which caters for students with a very diverse range of backgrounds and abilities from age 11 to 18 at secondary and tertiary level.  It offers an academic and vocational curriculum with GCSEs and Level 2 BTEC courses completed at age 16 and A levels and Level 3 BTEC courses completed at age 18.  A large proportion of our students have Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds and there are also a very large number of other nationalities represented from Europe, Asia and Africa, including some refugees. UK will contribute its competences and equipment of the fields of sciene and multiculturalism.\r\n\r\nThe project objectives are...\r\nTo help our students to improve basic and transversal skills. \r\nTo experience local similarities and differences in eating habits and attitudes towards foodstuffs.\r\nTo understand and value plurality and individual backgrounds compared to other countries and also within our area.\r\nTo raise the students' motivation to study science subjects more deeply.\r\nTo create awareness on the ethical aspects of food and the responsibility of every consumer.\r\nTo help our students to understand the importance of being part of European culture.\r\nTo produce  outcomes that we will share and publish to disseminate our ideas and products.\r\nTo help our students to improve their language skills as well as communication skills with peers.\r\nTo enhance the integrating of new theaching methods and ICT-based teaching.\r\nTo strengthen the school\u00b4s profiles in their area as European schools open to international cooperation.\r\nTo carry out  a series of activities to bring the project to life at our places. Such activities will include the design of a website, comparative studies, workshops, teaching portfolios, questionnaires, art projects and international learning activities. \r\nTo have a sustainable effect on the skills and attitude of students.", "http://www.oakspark.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT01-KA219-005110_1"]]}}}}
