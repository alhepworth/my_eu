The experience of the economic situation in the countries participating in the project, will give a broad vision and as comprehensive as possible of the work situation in Europe.\r\nThe project will be developed through different stages which the schools involved will run simultaneously, with a joint work event at a distance. The students involved will do research on the employment situation for their own country of origin, before and after the economic crisis, in order to make a comparison and have a vision of the real and practical problems.\r\nDuring this operational phase students will contact and visit the most representative institutions for the promotion and support of Policies in the field of employment. They will contact all the organizations and associations that have tracked the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises during the crisis, such as trade unions, local newspapers, trade associations, the Chamber of Commerce. The purpose of this phase, in addition to the collection of certain data, reliable and consistent, is to stimulate the students involved and pay particular attention to the problem of employment and encourage them to develop their own point of view regarding the crisis and their position in terms of potentiality and expectations in the context of professional opportunities.\r\nAt the end of these steps, all the work done will be embodied in creative works which, through events (eg conferences or seminars) will be made public in order to share the results, or during school days to spread among other students and teachers of the school the project and its purpose. A designated time for sharing and discussion of the results of the project will be a priority in every country involved.\r\nMoreover, the project will consider the students desires to be able to find a job that they like and for which they had been prepared at school and, on the other hand, the reality of the workplace they will encounter in each country. At the end of the project a document will be prepared which will identify the proposals to reduce unemployment and school drop-out: this document will be sent to the Department of Education and Community policies of the European Parliament.\r\nEnglish will be the working language, in order to develop and enhance skills of students regarding the language most commonly used in the European Community. The participants' attention will also point to develop computer skills through the use of tools such as mobile phones (smartphones ), computers, tablets as well as communication tools such as social networks, video conferencing, instant messages. This way, the students will improve their digital skills and language when called to debate the issues of the project with colleagues from different languages and geographical distance.\r\nThe project will have a European dimension and it will focus on the objectives required by the E C: helping to increase the employment rate as well as educating for entrepreneurship, the use of ICT and educational resources at a distance.", "http://www.oldershaw.wirral.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT02-KA201-003514_6"]]}}, "8PJ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "1914-2014 Il y a 100 ans, la Grande Guerre : regards crois\u00e9s d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves en l'Europe", "Mosslands School", 214099.0, 8, 8, "In all Europe , commemorations will mark the First World War Centenary. As we are willing to take part in this Memory work , we are submitting a project on this topic. Over a period of  3 years but more likely 4 years , the eight participating schools  representing a large area of this Europe at war  will present the Great War, the reasons and the consequences  of this conflict  to their school communities . The beauty of this project lies on the quality and diversity of the partners, \u201c friends and enemies\u201d  as well as \u201cNorth, South East and West fronts\u201d at that time.\r\n  The project is based on the numerous mobilities  which will allow each school together with their European school  partners  to take part in the commemorations  in its own city. This time together will enable the partners to share their work on the same topics. But most importantly ,those five days will be necessary for the building of a commemorative monument  by the European students .  \u201cThe large fresco\u201d will be built with the material and resources  of each school and will be made  from  different squares .T he frame, the size and the tints will be the same for each partner but the pattern is  free and can be made of ceramic, wood, glass, stone  depending on the  school\u2019s distinctive features ,technical skills and location.  Each square will be reproduced in eight copies so that each school  has a fresco very similar  to the other frescoes in order to display it in their school or on special local , regional or national events .\r\n  This three- year partnership ( from September 2014 to August 2017 ) is part of the many ceremonies planned in each participating country and therefore takes on a particularly interesting dimension  ; it  goes far beyond the mere school exchange program  and hopefully will get our students and the whole school community to attend commemorative ceremonies at local, regional and even national level.\r\n  This project deeply rooted in a historical context , enhanced  by the number and diversity of the  partners  will give  the teachers from very different school systems the opportunity  to share  their teaching experiences and academic expertise.\r\n  As far as the students are concerned, the goals of such a project are numerous and particularly rich . The students  will have the opportunity to improve their language skills ( French and English being the partnership languages ) and expand their historical knowledge. They will  have the chance to talk about the current living conditions in their countries and the  habits and customs  a century ago. Last but not least, this project bringing together  people who were \u201c allies and enemies 100 years ago\u201d will help  our students to understand what to be European means  and to build, define and develop the European citizenship . This reflection will lead to the writing of a short  Charter of the European Citizen ( in French and English) ,of poems and songs  in memory of the war and those who died . The students will present their works  at meetings and special events.\r\n  One last highlight of this partnership will be a meeting of all the partners in Paris from where they will all go to Verdun together. This meeting will take place  by the first half of the partnership.\r\n   The project based the whole time on ICT to make communication easier will start and end  with a meeting of the coordinators in order to make the organization and the coordination between the eight countries over 3 years  as efficient and accurate  as possible on one hand , and on the other to finalize the partnership  so that it will build a long term relationship between the different countries and spread beyond the school community ( teachers, students and parents) , the ultimate goal being the celebration of November 11 ,2018.", "http://www.mosslands.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA201-002307_2"], [2016, "Unissons nos coeurs sans fronti\u00e8res.", "Mosslands School", 154598.0, 8, 8, "The Erasmus + project is part of a strategic partnership between schools.It meets several objectives, the main one being the exchange of practices and teaching methods to improve transnational cooperation between schools.Eight different types of institutions (schools, colleges, vocational schools) located throughout the European area agree to work together for the next three years (2016-2019), sharing ideas and experiences. The ability to share teaching and educational experiences and to implement innovative activities will be of great benefit to the whole range of students but particularly to those who arrive in our establishments having had difficulties in their previous educational experiences. This project, entitled \"Uniting our hearts without borders\" will provide these vulnerable pupils in their daily lives with a positive learning experience. They will quickly reap benefits both personally and professionally thanks to a better command of the language of their host country.It is also incumbent on the participant project teams to reflect on the issue of migration because all European countries face today the same reception difficulties. Beyond the borders, joint discussions and reflection will be conducted on strategies to implement and to adapt our cultural teaching and learning methods. Of course, these young people will not be immediately aware of the added value of their experiences both on a personal and professional level.  But gradually, throughout the three years they will become aware that the proposed activities, exchanges with other partner institutions, will enable them to learn, gain confidence and to develop both their critical thinking skill and their creativity. They will be in a better position to measure the importance of the European community to which they now belong.For adult participants in the project (teachers, educators), this project is also a unique experience. Indeed, it is rare to be able to exchange information on education systems and teaching strategies with a range of countries of a continent. Transnational meetings are therefore an important element of the project. They will create links and they will inform reflections on the dynamics of the project.For this, the proposed activities are relatively diverse and allow all (students and adults) to get involved. They place great emphasis on the teaching of comprehension. Thus, students will discover the history of Europe, the European Union, as well as the geography and traditions of the eight institutions. Emphasis will be given to direct exchanges (E. Twinning, Skype). All of the discovery and creative activities, both written and oral, must allow each student to improve their language competences as well as to understand  the workings of their host country in order to obtain new knowledge and thus to build their own image of the country in question.Moreover, the essential values are shared by all. Each student will have their place in the project and will be open to a better informed view of Europe. The dimension of \"European citizen\" is addressed in many activities.In addition, the mobilities planned for the second and third years will be a real asset to our young people. This is the best way to experience a different culture and to develop new levels of expertise. Such mobilities allow both personal enrichment as well as building self-confidence and transferable professional skills.Finally, this project contributes to the influence of Europe in general.  Each establishment will become the cultural \"showcase\u201d for the member countries of the project. Indeed, all of Europe is covered by this project, Southern Europe with Portugal and Italy, Eastern Europe with Romania and Poland, North and West Europe with Germany, France, England and also a country which is outside of Europe but belongs to the Erasmus Programme network: Turkey. This project is exceptional in that it involves eight educational establishments. The choice of partners was based on the history of migration in each country (emigration / immigration). To some extent, we can say that geographical Europe is covered thereby providing participants with an overview of the European continent.In addition, all partners, with the exception of Turkey, have already participated in this type of project (Erasmus, Erasmus Programme Comenius). Some have even worked together already. Therefore a sense of trust and confidence exists and many of the partners have experience and expertise in working collaboratively. Previous projects have always worked well. The principal of the project is spread over a vast area ready to work together in a spirit of innovation and experimentation.", "http://www.mosslands.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA219-023966_1"]]}}}}
