Children that receive this type of education are more aware of their schoolmates and they have higher results than the average level.  This fact is confirmed by the french PISA results which are deceiving since they point out the lack of confidence and the fear of failure of the french students. Our priority is to build this kind of school, benevolent and capable of giving self confidence, but also demanding in terms of learnings, capacities and skills.\r\n\r\nOur questionning is the following one: How do we organize this benevolent school, what structure, what kind of teachers, what tools, how should we behave ? We have to find the way to create a surrounding that respects the child's needs so as to develop his skills, understandings and the quality of his knowledges.\r\nThat's the reason why we want to exchange our pedagogical practices in Europe in order to find the sequences that respond to these needs. The main goal is to create a real pedagogical toll box that contains all the practices, organizations, pedagogical sequences that will enable each teacher to teach this kind of benevolent and demanding pedagogy.\r\n\r\n For this project six european kindergarten will participate : Sweden, Italia, Greece, Estonia, Denmark and France. These six countries have already been engaged in empathic pedagogy. The main purpose of this pproject is to create a collective website that will become a data base for all the european teachers that want to get involved in that kind of pedagogy. We will be helped by a professional webmaster to elaborate this website so that it will be translated in the six different languages and also in english. Each part will be a blog that will allow a real participation from the six educative community.\r\nOur working methode will be the following one : the benevolence will be examined on various point of view, the teacher's role, he child's place, the organization of the classroom and of the material, the parents' actions, the following-up of the work, the time schedule, the management of particular disabilities. \r\nDuring each mobility we will focus on two different criteria. At first, we will elaborate an observation grid that will enable us to identify what are the criteria that allow a benevolent pedagogy. In a second time through this grid we will observe what is going on in our host's classroom and we will analyze it together. At last, back in our country, each partner\r\n\r\nBack in our schools, each partner will present with a video, pictures or a power point presentation, his interesting pedagogical practices that he uses in order to share it with the educative community. Each partner will try in their classroom the interesting pedagogical discoveries that we've made during the mobility. The procedure will be the same after each mobility, so that we can use and try in our own practices, the different aspects of this benevolent pedagogy discovered collectively.\r\n\r\nEvery intellectual production will be uploaded on the collective website. The results of our work during each mobility will be also diffused during the meetings with the parents and the conferences that we will organize with the pedagogical community.\r\nMore than 3 000 persons will directly benefit from this project : all the students from the concerned kindergarten, but also their parents and every associative or institutional school partners. Will also be concerned, the entire pedagogical community that will have access to our website and our data base.\r\n\r\nThe project's impact will occur in each school participating at this project through the evolution of their teachers' practices and the new organization of their school. The teachers from the 6 countries concerned will progress in their attitudes, practices, capacities and will be able to apply the best European pedagogy. They will form themselves and become better educational professional.Our students will get confidence in themselves, discover the pleasure of learning and progress in their skills. In a wider impact, every educator that has access to our work, through the website or the conferences, will be able to find elements to help him produce  a benevolent and demanding pedagogy.", "http://www.emneth-nur.norfolk.sch.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA219-037172_1"], [2017, "International Perspectives on Early Years Education", "Emneth Nursery School & Children's Centre", 7274.0, 1, 1, "We are a Nursery School, Children's Centre and Day-care Provision serving over 500 families in our local area. We are a rural setting in Norfolk with high disadvantage. We work with complex families and increasing numbers of children on the Child Protection register and with SEND. \r\nOur project aims are primarily to raise standards of teaching and learning across the school and improve staff competency and pedagogy that will bring in other new perspectives influenced heavily by practice outside of the UK. \r\nTo address our objectives we have selected attendance at 2 structured training courses in Italy  and Sweden. These being:\r\n1) ITALY- Creative Teaching approaches in Early Years and Pre-School settings (4 staff) Organised by LEAP- 2 staff to visit in October 2017 and 2 staff to visit in November 2017; Delivered by experienced teachers and advisors. Includes\r\n* Visits to educational establishments\r\n* Visit to Reggio Children's Centres\r\n* Observations on teaching staff in Italy\r\n* Engagement with colleagues across EU\r\n* Development of teaching plans to use back in school \r\n* Reflection and dialogue with professionals\r\n\r\n2) Forest Learning: The Swedish Perspective-SWEDEN- May 2018: (2 staff) Organised by LEAP. Includes;\r\n* Observation of teaching\r\n* Principles of Swedish education system\r\n* Outdoor learning practical tasks\r\n* Future links for partnership working\r\n* Promotion of personalised learning environments for children\r\n* Developing emotional, social and well-being in children through Forest Schools approach\r\n\r\nIn total, 6 staff will benefit from funding directly, however the impact will be far greater as they return and lead projects and pedagogy for other staff members and the local community. \r\n\r\nThe 6 staff participating in the project will be our Deputy Head Teacher and 5 Educators who work directly with children aged birth to five. Our aim from the project is to sustain longer term relationships and partnerships with other schools in the UK and EU and work together professionally way beyond the end of the projects. \r\n\r\nStaff will engage in reflective impactful practices in collaboration with others, learning together with others also participating in the chosen projects. As a result the staff will plan creative learning experiences for children that will develop wide ranging skills that will remain the foundations for all future learning experiences into Primary, secondary and Post 16 Education. \r\n\r\nWe envisage the project to have many outcomes:\r\n\r\nEnhanced knowledge of methodologies overseas\r\nIncreased understanding of education systems in Europe \r\nIncreased knowledge of national and local educational policies\r\nImproved quality of staff members work with children, application of new teaching methods\r\nIncreased staff motivation and satisfaction in the field of Early Years\r\nBetter partnerships locally, nationally and across Europe\r\nRaising attainment of all children irrespective of gender, background or socio-economic factors\r\nEnhanced Leadership and Management knowledge of pedagogy and European Policy\r\nInnovation in the creative curriculum \r\nCascading knowledge to stakeholders such as parents, governors and other local schools and Children's Centres\r\n\r\nThe attendance at training will enable Emneth to incorporate international perspectives into current practices, effectively learning from all of the best teaching methods from the UK and EU. This will significantly raise our own teaching standards, resulting in narrowing the gap for our most vulnerable families and children and impacting on social mobility. \r\n\r\nWe hope that staff will gain greater confidences and insight into international practices that will give them the aspiration to develop and potentially train beyond their existing qualification levels e.g.. to degree/Masters level.", "http://www.emneth-nur.norfolk.sch.uk/", "Emneth Nursery School & Children's Centre", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035514_coordinator"]]}}}}
