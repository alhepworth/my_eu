Our goal as an organisation is to develop European VET work placement programs for staff and learners/graduates, from the Irish Outdoor Education and Adventure sector that make lifelong learning and mobility within the sector a reality for our learners.  We promote equity; social cohesion and active citizenship by enabling our participants acquire and develop new skills and competencies needed for their employability. Our placements foster further learning, active citizenship and intercultural dialogue. \r\n\r\nWithin the CARVE program there are a number of placements for staff currently working in the sector and recent graduates from vocational training programs that qualified them as outdoor activity instructors. Over the coming year our placements for staff are aimed at providing them with the skills, knowledge and competencies required to improve the standards of the sector in Ireland. \r\n\r\nOur first Erasmus + staff placement in Sept/Oct 2014 is a two week placement with Action Outdoors in Chamonix aimed at providing staff with the knowledge, skills and competencies to effectively build and manage a group adventure experience in the Alps. Our second placement is for current diving instructors to spend 60 days in British Virgin Islands. The placement provides these staff with the opportunity to shadow and work alongside dive instructors with Sail Caribbean (autumn 2014 & spring 2015). We are also sending 3 wind/kite surfing instructors to work with Club Mistral in the Gran Canaries in autumn 2014 and another 3 in spring 2015 for 60 days.  Our placements for learners or recent graduates provides 4 recent graduates with work placements with Club Mistral in May/June 2015 for 60 days in Spain and Greece. We also have one recent graduate travelling to the UK to work with Lindley Education Trust May/June 2015 and 4 recent graduates travelling out to work with Sail Caribbean in May/June 2015 for 60 days.

LET has 50 years\u2019 experience of supporting personal development through challenging and inspiring outdoor activities, including climbing, caving, kayaking and bushcraft, delivered in a safe, supportive environment and led by professional instructors. LET\u2019s work is delivered from two residential centres in the Peak District, and, increasingly, through outreach projects in disadvantaged urban areas. LET is committed to inclusion and is able to adapt many of its activities to support those with additional needs. The organisation also has a bursary fund to enable the participation of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and to support groups that need a higher instructor to client ratio.Objectives:This project aims to \u2022 provide an immersive experience of the outdoor learning sector\u2022 support employability through facilitating the development of the skills, experience and attributes needed to work in the outdoor learning sector \u2022 support the development of range of task-specific skills, informal learning, reflective processes and personal development.  \u2022 support the development of English language skills in a range of real life contexts\u2022 support cultural exchange and understanding and help build ongoing links with organisations across Europe to facilitate exchange of ideas and best practice\u2022 raise awareness of European volunteer opportunities with the young people that LET works with, many of whom are from disadvantaged communities\u2022 increase the number of outdoor activity projects taking part in EVS and other international exchange  programmes.Volunteer Profile:The current project seeks to support one volunteer, an 18-year-old woman from Germany who proactively contacted LET as the receiving organisation and IJGD as the sending organisation. Following an outward bound course, plus voluntary work supervising outdoor activities for children, the volunteer decided she wishes to pursue a career in outdoor education.LET is keen to host more Erasmus and EVS placements in the future, and potentially to act as a sending organisation for some of the many young people they work withActivities and Methodology:Through this project, the volunteer will get involved with all aspects of LET\u2019s work. She will work alongside our instructors and experience all aspects of working in the delivery of outdoor education.  The volunteer will initially observe sessions; as her confidence, competence and experience increases she will have opportunities to lead certain sessions, under supervision, and, potentially, to lead low risk activities by herself. She will have the opportunity to complete LET\u2019s in-house training programme for on-site activities, plus attend relevant National Governing Body training courses for adventurous outdoor activities. She will also learn how to facilitate learning, develop a range of practical guided reflection and reviewing techniques, and gain valuable experience of different learning styles. Whilst these skills and techniques are used in the outdoor education setting they are highly transferable, and highly sought after, in many other industries.LET also works in an outreach capacity with young people in a very deprived area of Greater Manchester. The volunteer will have opportunities to get involved with this programme, supporting the delivery of sessions and hosting discussion with participants.Refection and review are a key part of the programme and the volunteer will be supported in setting and reviewing objectives, and also in identifying the areas of LET\u2019s work in which she is most interested. She will be assigned a Mentor with whom she will have regular review sessions.Results and Impact:The expected impact for the volunteer are the development the competences, values, skills and ability to work with a diverse range of young people in an outdoor education setting, including those with additional needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The benefits for LET include having a fresh perspective on current practices and procedures - the volunteer will be asked to give feedback and suggest improvements. LET will also be able to forge links with European partners to support information exchange and future volunteer placements.Longer term benefit:Dissemination of the programme results will, we hope, encourage more young people to enroll on EVS and Erasmus+ programmes and experience the huge range of benefits these bring. Since registering on the EYP database, LET has been inundated with requests from potential volunteers. By sharing the results of the current programme amongst the outdoor learning sector, LET aims to encourage more outdoor learning organisations to offer EVS and Erasmus+ placements, helping to meet the demand and share the benefits.", "http://www.lindleyeducationaltrust.org", "CHANGE AGENTS UK CHARITY", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA105-023704_2"]]}}}}
