A substancial amount of the students come from rural environment with disadvantaged backgrounds;many face barriers that limit their ability to  access  careers, to travel abroad and receive adequate training.Great efforts have been  made to create an inclusive,secure and supportive community environment where our main aim is to nurture each student to achieve his/her potential by providing innovative practices,and opportunity for all. Special personalised  attention is given  to students according to their needs and  diversity, which are highly valued.The school has been developing the Emotional Competence Project since 2008 and later, in 2013 we secured the 2nd Educative Innovation Award from our Educational Community Goverment,\"Premios Joaqu\u00edn Sama\".Since this project,based on Social and Emotional learning, was implemented in our school,there have been several positive effects on diverse students with and without emotional and behavioural difficulties.The cross-curricular project activities have been integrated in regular class curriculum and extra-curricular activities and developed gradually by teachers and pupils.The school Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) cross-curricular project includes activities in different subjects and a special effort will be made to ensure its implementation in the Bilingual Section. Bearing in mind all mentioned above,our school has  strongly pointed out the need for further learning and sharing of our knowledge on SEL with other European Schools,especially those that need to develop quality school programmes that will improve the basic and transversal skills of students and school staff and combat dropout rates,social exclusion and poverty. To accomplish this goal,participants need to attend linguistic training courses to enable them to understand foreign languages and cultures, develop teachers' communicative and linguistic competences and  observe new methodologies in other European institutions so that they may promote innovation.These courses enable teachers to maintain a higher level of contact, and  also help build  strategic partnerships in a future Key Action 2 (KA2). They foster an environment that encourages innovation and the exchange of good practices.Regarding bilingualism, our institution has had an English Blingual Section  for two years. Currently, there are four staff members who teach non-linguistic subjects in two diferent educational levels of Compulsory Secondary Education: Mathematics, Technology, Physical Education and  Arts. Staff members will gradually join the bilingual section as it spreads to other educational levels in the future. In order to spread bilingualism throughout the school, it will first be necessary to provide  the teachers with foreign languages and non-linguistic subject training; this will ensure teachers have more practice with languages, develop communicative,linguistic and cultural skills,and implement  CLIL methodology creating new resources.To satisfy the identified needs, we are applying for six members of our teaching staff to participate in formative activities.The teachers involved in the project are teachers of English, Mathematics, History and Geography  and also the Coordinator of the \"Emotional Competence Project,Special Needs teacher.The participants and some others from the teaching staff will be in charge of writing the programme,selecting the candidates and they will organize all the preparatory activities previous to the the mobilities, the assessment and impact of the training activities,as well as the dissemination process according to needs.In order to fulfill the project,the participants have begun B1and B2 level English courses to receive certification of language competences.They are also attending workshops that involve creation of CLIL materials. Regarding the preparatory activity for the job-shadowing, participants will attend a talk about The United Kingdom Educative System in order to build their background knowledge.Through these efforts, the participants expect to develop a deeper understanding of the English language ( the language for some non-linguistic subjects in our Bilingual Section) and to update their linguistic, communicative and cultural competence in English. Other teachers will be exposed to other educative systems,innovative methodologies, CLIL and cultures and they will be able to integrate this into the teaching-learning process.

Despite most EU countries having a transition process in place there are few practical programmes that support young adults during their final year of school to prepare for leaving.  Practical programmes and initiatives to support the transition from school vary greatly across the EU and are fragmented and lack consistency. To  make a successful  transition from school it is essential that young people are prepared for adult life including opportunities to apply  learning to  practical  adult situations. This includes making informed choices about post school options and the responsibilities and expectations that are associated with being a young adult in the 21st Century. Typically this work is not undertaken by school teachers as they do not have the skills, remit tor contacts with adult services to do so affectively. Research undertaken by the NI  Assembly  in 2015 highlighted the importance of involving non governmental agencies during transition planning and preparation and this is echoed throughout the EU.   Research  carried out in 2011 by the Academic Network of European Disability Experts  (ANED) highlighted that across the EU the transition to post compulsory education is problematic for young disabled people and there are fewer opportunities  to enter and progress into further education or employment. They attribute these challenges to education systems that fail to provide young people with disabilities with the skills required to progress beyond the school environment and teachers often lack the appropriate methodology tools to prepare them for adult life. \r\nThe project will conduct the following activities:\r\n\r\n1. Conduct  research into transition services available in partner states including national and local initiatives.  The research will evaluate the effectiveness of services and  identify good practice and gaps  to assist with the development of relevant training resources.

The research will also seek to establish if such available opportunities are being maximised by the grouping in question and, if not, why are there such shortfalls in the respective jurisdictions which will be monitored.

Misestimating of meteorological conditions or large forecasting errors (phase errors, near cut-off speeds etc), are very costly for infrastructures (i.e. unexpected loads on turbines) and reduce the value of wind energy for end-users. The state of the art in wind power forecasting focused so far on the &quot;usual&quot; operating conditions rather than on extreme events. Thus, the current wind forecasting technology presents several strong bottlenecks. End-users urge for dedicated approaches to reduce large prediction errors or predict extremes at local scale (gusts, shears) up to a European scale as extremes and forecast errors may propagate. Similar concerns arise from the fields of external conditions and resource assessment, where the aim is to minimize project failure. The aim of this project is to substantially improve wind power predictability in challenging or extreme situations and at different temporal and spatial scales. Going beyond this, wind predictability is considered as a system design parameter linked to the resource assessment phase, where the aim is to take optimal decisions for the installation of a new wind farm. The project concentrates on: using new measuring devices for a more detailed knowledge of the wind speed and energy available at local level; develop strong synergy with research in meteorology; develop new operational methods for the very-short-term for warning/alerting that use coherently collected meteorological and wind power data distributed over Europe to early detect and forecast extreme events; develop models to improve medium term wind predictability; develop a European vision of wind forecasting taking advantage of existing operational forecasting installations at various European end-users.
