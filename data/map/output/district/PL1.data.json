The proposed 5-year programme brings together single cell biophysics, imaging and state of the art molecular biology with in situ studies of natural oceanic phytoplankton populations, focussing principally on two significant groups, the diatoms and coccolithophores.  A major aim is to gain critical mechanistic understanding of membrane transport, cellular regulation and key physiological processes at the single cell level along with information on the microenvironment that surrounds cells.  This will be used in conjunction with modelling studies to determine how phytoplankton cells regulate their immediate environment and how this in turn interacts with metabolic activity.   In order to understand how the physiological properties of single cells in the laboratory translate to behaviour of natural populations we will examine cell physiological properties in natural populations.  Knowledge of cell- to-cell variability will provide insights into the plasticity of populations and their responses to changing ocean conditions.

Cyanobacteria cause similar problems in freshwaters. These episodes encompass a broad range of phenomena collectively referred to as \u00abharmful algal blooms\u00bb (HABs). They include discoloration of waters by mass occurrences of microalgae (true algal blooms that may or may not be \u00abharmful\u00bb) to toxin-producing species that may be harmful even in low cell concentrations. A broad classification of HAB distinguishes three groups of toxic organisms. For adequate management of these phenomena, monitoring of microalgae is required.  However, the effectiveness of monitoring programmes is limited by the fact that it is time consuming and morphology as determined by light microscopy may be insufficient to give definitive species and toxin attribution. Once cell numbers reach a threshold level, then shellfish are selected to toxin analysis by the mouse bioassay. The mouse bioassay is continued on a daily basis until no more toxin is detected. Molecular and biochemical methods are now available that offer rapid means of both species and toxin detection.

Indeed the CO2 diffuses into the surface layers of the global ocean, including causing a significant decrease in pH and carbonate ion (CO3-). These acidic conditions make biomineralization of calcareous shell increasingly difficult, threatening biodiversity with extinction of calcifying plankton ecosystems, with all the brutal feedback effects on regional and global climate. In particular, coccolithophores, haptophytes microalgae covered with small calcareous scales occur today ~30% of pelagic carbonates, a central process of the carbon cycle between the different compartments of the biosphere. How will coccolithophores react to abrupt climate changes? More our understanding of how biodiversity will respond to abrupt climate changes is limited by a fundamental lack of understanding of eukaryotic ocean biodiversity, and rates of biodiversity change.

After general secondary education students switch too much in the first years of further vocational education and university, because they were not well informed about what education fitted to them. A lack of information, not knowing exactly what the characteristiscs are, what learning skills are important and not knowing well what kind of jobs fit to their own interest and talents and what requirements meet the demands on the labour market. Key problem is that the young students didn't have the slightest idea about the actual and future labour market. The schoolprocess can be characterised as an internal process, with a focus on learning aims defined by the Ministries of education in the involved countries. The schools have to change their focus to the outside world of work. What are the developments at the labour market, how can we inform our students better, how can teachers be better trained to support students in career orientation and career guidance. Students need a better understanding of work, occupation and employment in order to make a more balanced study choice for further vocational education or university.  Active and intensive cooperation with companies forms an import part of the process of career orientation and career guidance. Companies get connected with employees of the future and utilize the brainpower of young people.  Main stakeholders in this project are students, schools (management, teachers, deans, mentors) and companies/HRM department.Therefore we will work out a well balanced programme to prepare general secondary school students better for further education.  Components to develop in this project are: - Conceptual framework of \"labour market orientated career orientation and career guidance\"\";- Guideline for building a sustainable network of companies/organisations for general secondary education;- Blueprint and tools to realise a \"labour market orientated curriculum\" in schools for general secondary education OUTSIDE IN;- Description training programme INSIDE OUT;- Toolbox \"OUTSIDE IN INSIDE OUT\".By producing these Intellectual Outputs schools will dispose of a toolbox which will increase the quality of education significantly, students will choose further vocational education more balanced/well founded, students will switch less in further vocational education or university, students will be better prepared to enter the labour market for a job with perspective and a job which fits to the individual competences and interest.Impact of this project is big, satisfaction will grow: schools are equipped to support the guiding process of students (labour market orientated career orientation and career guidance), less early school leaving, less switches in further education after general secondary education, companies will dispose of better educated/trained future employees. Focus: OUTSIDE IN: the world of work is starting point; INSIDE OUT: the school prepares students better on their way to work.Important stakeholders connected in this project: schools, local government, companies, parents, students, youth ambassadors, Public Employment Service, training institutions and guidance providers. In every country a steeringgroup will be formed to monitor the progress, development and to give feedback and input for further progress.   The involved countries (Netherlands, UK, Austria and Finland) all will form such steeringgroup. During the transnational management meetings exchange of information will take place to disseminate experiences.Important to highlight is the involvement of students and youth ambassadors. They will act as soundboard during the two years project period.In the whole EU we face the same problems, students have a lack of insight concerning the actual and future labour market, there is a weak connection between schools and the world of work. This all is of big importance, we still have too many dropouts (ESL), too many students switch in the first stage at VET, higher vocational education and university. The effect is decrease of motivation of youngsters, the schoolperiod extends and youth unemployment raises.It is important to all of us to work on this together in the interest of the students on their way to qualifications in VET, Higher vocational education and university, in the interest of good qualified staff at schools, in the interest of a well functioning labour market.The endproduct \"toolbox Outside in, Inside out\" will be of great value to support schools in preparing the students for the next step!

The aim is to raise awareness among adults to the promoting of the human rights, social rights, and also the riddance of poverty, racism and exclusion. The final outcome is to come to a large-bodied project for Erasmus+ program, on the theme of \"Human Rights and the fight against exclusion with, for and by the migrants\".\r\n\r\nObjectives: it is primordial that we promulgate an universal culture of Human Rights thanks to the education, in parallel with other international organizations. It is also important to involve vulnerable groups of migrants, to support them during their hard times, to improve the lives of people facing severe and multiple disadvantages, to fight against the social exclusion and discrimination. We have to improve our services by gaining competencies and skills that had to be improved or learnt, we have to widen our knowledge about every type of migrants in order to give them the right advice. For this improvement, the foreign language is a boundary. For that, we would like to send members of our staff abroad, in order to learn new things, and to improve the language skills.\r\n\r\nThe overall goals to achieve in short and long term are the creation of mechanisms for people to participate actively to the building of an harmonious interethnic democracy and a culture of peace, in the field of equality and the struggle with discrimination and exclusion; to go into their knowledge in depth about the situation of migrants from disadvantaged areas and their vulnerability; the exchanging experiences with participating people from diverse countries; the creation of a contact network with leaders of each country; to provide solutions and strategies to allow the improvement of education on Human Rights and social rights of migrants in their country; the living of an intercultural experience with participants from each involved country in similar programs; and finally to provoke the willingness among participants to take part in international large-bodied projects, whose main topics are the migrants, their rights, a sustainable development and the creation of an exchange program in Erasmus+ framework.", "http://www.amber-initiatives.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-BE01-KA104-013165_1"], [2016, "Promoting Integration", "Amber  Initiatives", 2824.0, 4, 4, "This  project will address a need of European communities  to help young people  from refugees and migrant background to tackle socio-economic issues and promote social equity and inclusion.This project will fill a gap in  competences of youth workers from the European organisations, with special focus on project management  and involvement hard-to-reach groups of migrants and refugees into integration related activities.Amber Initiaitves are working with migrants communities for 10 years, gained knowledge and expertise in migration related issues.

This goal is realised in close cooperation with our partners in the dual system of training. In addition to the development of our institution, the development of intionational and intercultural skills of our learners ist the motivation for this project. The need of well trained skilled employees with these competences is especially high in the rural district of Cloppenburg with its high number of medium sized companies operating worldwide. That`s why our institution as a regional centre of competence is aware of its responsibility in terms of offering the opportunity to gain international experiences and to promote the international competences for its learners and  teachers.

On the one hand they will experience a broadening of their job related professional competences. A second important goal is the advancement of the methodological competences of our learners. The trainees will have to deal with various organisational matters abroad. They`ll organise the accommodation and their trip.\r\nThe development of our learners` social competences is a further important goal. The focus of our activities lies especially on the promotion of  the intercultural key competences of our students. In a different environment, our learners have to establish and develop social contacts to co-workers and other people abroad by making use of a foreign language.

The theoretical knowledge gained in vocational courses and on the language platform OLS in Germany can be applied directly in the job situation abroad.\r\nBesides their commercial duties, the learners will carry out monitoring and self-evaluation tasks. In particular, the goal of our project is to compare behaviour patterns in companies with those patterns which can be found in the training companies in Germany. Therefore we will create a questionnaire with the help of the learners involved. This questionnaire will contain questions concerning the relations between superiors and workers, general behaviour patterns or the dealing with customers or suppliers. All matters of agreement like duration, financial aspects or insurance obligations will be written down in a contract and signed by all partners.\r\nThe quality and transparency of the learning outcomes will be secured in a permanent cooperation with our partners in Germany and abroad.

While analysing the dominant tendencies emerging in the sector of independent language schools, it has become clear for us that in addition to the age groups of secondary school students and young adults, the number of senior adult students aged 45+ is higher and higher year by year. Since in each member country of the European Union, including Hungary, there are new job-market related and demographic trends, it is the mutual interest of both the individual language learners aged 45+ and the language teaching institute involved in adult education, that bigger and bigger emphasis should be placed on the needs of senior students.

The teachers of our school will take part in 11 mobilities. Its primary purpose is to improve the skills of teaching by our teachers with the help of the latest technology. Because in our school we have already had a few tables and interactive whiteboards we would like to carry out more interesting classroom lessons during which students would learn with pleasure. We believe that the effective use of intuitive-to-use devices with touch screens, so tablets and interactive whiteboards will help our students develop their skills. In this way we not only improve the quality of education in our school, but also we meet the expectations of today's youth. As teachers we often observe that young people are so accustomed to the use of digital technology at every step of their lives that they acquire knowledge passed on a flat screen much faster than the one from the old fashioned books. We are sure the project will give us the opportunity to create and develop a more modern school, improve the linguistic competence of the employees, and above all, implement new technological tools.\r\nThere are three groups of teachers in the project:\r\n1. Two teachers of English, who in our previous project took part in the general course of the usage of the computers to conduct lessons. This time they will be taking a secialized training on which they will learn to use tablets and appropriate applications for conducting modern educational classes.\r\n2. Six teachers from our school will raise their skills during the course that connects the usage of modern technology in the classroom with improving language skills. After completing these courses, teachers will present their knowledge to their colleagues during the meetings of the committee concerned. They will be able to freely use interactive whiteboards and other technological tools, and also improve their language skills useful in introducing elements CLIL their lessons.\r\n3. Within the same project we plan to take advantage of the \"Job shadowing\" opportunity to observe classes taught by teachers in another countries. the purpose of it is learning, exchanging teaching skills and watching how everything works in these schools. We would like five of our teachers to make such visists in Liceo Cannizzaro, Palermo, Sicily. What is more, we are also going to host a group of teachers from that school to watch our school and observe our lessons. We believe this kind of experience will allow us to have a chance to discuss the educational systems and methods in our schools, and also let us copy the most practical ways of using modern technology in the school. We hope that the contact with the school in Palermo will give our school even more European dimension and open our students for an active contact in English.

While analysing the dominant tendencies emerging in the sector of independent language schools, it has become clear for us that in addition to the age groups of secondary school students and young adults, the number of senior adult students aged 45+ is higher and higher year by year. Since in each member country of the European Union, including Hungary, there are new job-market related and demographic trends, it is the mutual interest of both the individual language learners aged 45+ and the language teaching institute involved in adult education, that bigger and bigger emphasis should be placed on the needs of senior students.

Situated in the center of Lyon, the high school mostly integrates students from disadvantaged suburban areas of the city, and very often from socially deprived families coming from European and internationnal varied origins .\r\nThe European Section opened in 2002. It integrates the most motivated students of Vocational Bac Commerce, Reception and Services, who want to improve their skills in English.\r\nThe chosen approach is Professionnal Communication and language reinforcement through oral practice. The  experience of mobility is the essential motivation of the students who wish to practice their linguistic and professional skils in real work situations to be able later on, to integrate the labour market.\r\nThe 5 students from the one year CAP level 5, Hat-makers and dress-makers, are young adults who have chosen to specialize in these creative fields after varied curricula.The school gives them the opportunity to do one of their two one-month work placement in a European country of their choice, usually chosing from our network of companies. Many experiences in Berlin, Munich, Nuremberg have already been conducted.\r\nThe objectives of the mobility experience are:\r\n1/ Acquiring professional knowledge and skills through integration into the workplace and through the practice of English or German language. Mobility will allow the students to finalize the school learning process and the skills developped in former placements in France. It will develop the participants' capacity of reflecting and exchanging through their adaptation to the workstation and to the economic, social and cultural environment of the chosen companies and cities.\r\n2/ Developping interpersonal abilities and skills for Commerce , Reception and Services in which quality relations are needed.The experience of mobility will participate in developping these skills through the confrontation of experiences but also through the use of communication jobs specific tools (IT) when preparing, doing, evaluating or reporting the placement.\r\nFace to face reception, informing and  guiding people will reinforce the relational abilities of the participants.\r\nGetting familiar with other ideas, with other professional and everyday cultures, but also with other tools and other ways of doing things builds open-minded, responsible citizens, who will fit in the European Area.\r\n2bis/ Using different equipments, tools and techniques.

Its main profile is adult education and it is provided with all the necessary licences allowing it to function as an adult educational institute. \r\nIn the last few years we have set up new goals selecting new target groups of students. We have laid special emphasis on teaching foreign languages to senior students over 45. \r\nSince the academic manager of the school is visually impaired (VI), a considerable number of VI students has studied in the school. Recently we have also received some adult students with hearing impairment (HI). Experiencing the learning difficulties of our impaired students, our interest has turned towards the equality of opportunities accessible to the Hungarian VI and HI. We have started to take interest in examining the hardships they while learning foreign languages. \r\nIn the framework of the Erasmus+ Project we endeavour to participate in a mobility programme during which our teachers can access knowledge of and gain experience in foreign language teaching to VI and HI adults and we intend to provide our teachers with the special language teaching methodology needed in this field. We plan to delegate 9 qualified teachers to 3 different language institutes in 3 distinct countries of the EU. (UK, Malta, Spain)\r\nEvery course is designed for 2 weeks and their focus will be on various sub-fields and aspects of foreign language teaching to VI and HI adults. On the basis of the syllabi received from our 3 selected partners, all of them seem to be thoroughly knowledgeable and strongly committed. \r\nIn our partner school in England the goals are to cover a wide spectrum of topics giving comprehensive picture about teaching foreign languages to VI and HI adults: they are due to present the special needs of the students concerned, relate to their own practical experience and deliver all their knowledge in methodology gained during their work with the local and regional institutes dealing with impaired adults. The participants in the course are scheduled to visit institutes involved in special education and to meet VI language teachers. \r\nOur project partner in Malta puts the emphasis on teaching English to HI adults. Their experts are determined to explore the special methods of how to develop various language skills for HI adults and to reveal their particular cognitive and psychological specialities. They also plan to introduce the technical devices available for the HI. \r\nOur project partner in Spain is equipped with a vast amount of knowledge and practical experience in teaching foreign languages to VI. \r\nThe preparatory period has lasted 5 months as a result of a long a thorough selection process. From the very beginning we have made it clear that the most important goal of the whole project  is to supply our experienced languages teachers with the special methods and approaches of surdo-pedagogy and tiflo-pedagogy that can help them teach foreign languages to VI and HI adults. \r\nIt is noteworthy to mention that there is no special university course for language teachers where the special methodology can be obtained and no foreign language specialisation for SEN teachers either.   It is a gap to fill because it is impossible to achieve results in the field of social inclusion without helping VI and HI adults in learning foreign languages.  \r\nWe are planning to disseminate our knowledge and experience in every possible forum:  our main target audience is our teachers who will not participate in the mobility but show interest in the topic.\r\nWe are convinced that our participating teachers will obtain new competences, mostly intercultural, they will get an insight into an under-researched field of methodology. With this asset our language school will be able to help the social integration of the VI and HI. We expect that the intercultural competences will be developed in our teachers and as a result our VI and HI students can learn foreign languages easily and efficiently in our school.

In effect, any significant interruption in these services could potentially jeopardize several important high-level policy objectives and undermine other related scientific activities.\nIn the period from October 2014 to March 2015, MyOcean-FO will ensure a controlled continuation and extension of the services already implemented in MyOcean and MyOcean2 FP7 projects that have advanced the pre-operational marine service capabilities.

After general secondary education students switch too much in the first years of further vocational education and university, because they were not well informed about what education fitted to them. A lack of information, not knowing exactly what the characteristiscs are, what learning skills are important and not knowing well what kind of jobs fit to their own interest and talents and what requirements meet the demands on the labour market. Key problem is that the young students didn't have the slightest idea about the actual and future labour market. The schoolprocess can be characterised as an internal process, with a focus on learning aims defined by the Ministries of education in the involved countries. The schools have to change their focus to the outside world of work. What are the developments at the labour market, how can we inform our students better, how can teachers be better trained to support students in career orientation and career guidance. Students need a better understanding of work, occupation and employment in order to make a more balanced study choice for further vocational education or university.  Active and intensive cooperation with companies forms an import part of the process of career orientation and career guidance. Companies get connected with employees of the future and utilize the brainpower of young people.  Main stakeholders in this project are students, schools (management, teachers, deans, mentors) and companies/HRM department.Therefore we will work out a well balanced programme to prepare general secondary school students better for further education.  Components to develop in this project are: - Conceptual framework of \"labour market orientated career orientation and career guidance\"\";- Guideline for building a sustainable network of companies/organisations for general secondary education;- Blueprint and tools to realise a \"labour market orientated curriculum\" in schools for general secondary education OUTSIDE IN;- Description training programme INSIDE OUT;- Toolbox \"OUTSIDE IN INSIDE OUT\".By producing these Intellectual Outputs schools will dispose of a toolbox which will increase the quality of education significantly, students will choose further vocational education more balanced/well founded, students will switch less in further vocational education or university, students will be better prepared to enter the labour market for a job with perspective and a job which fits to the individual competences and interest.Impact of this project is big, satisfaction will grow: schools are equipped to support the guiding process of students (labour market orientated career orientation and career guidance), less early school leaving, less switches in further education after general secondary education, companies will dispose of better educated/trained future employees. Focus: OUTSIDE IN: the world of work is starting point; INSIDE OUT: the school prepares students better on their way to work.Important stakeholders connected in this project: schools, local government, companies, parents, students, youth ambassadors, Public Employment Service, training institutions and guidance providers. In every country a steeringgroup will be formed to monitor the progress, development and to give feedback and input for further progress.   The involved countries (Netherlands, UK, Austria and Finland) all will form such steeringgroup. During the transnational management meetings exchange of information will take place to disseminate experiences.Important to highlight is the involvement of students and youth ambassadors. They will act as soundboard during the two years project period.In the whole EU we face the same problems, students have a lack of insight concerning the actual and future labour market, there is a weak connection between schools and the world of work. This all is of big importance, we still have too many dropouts (ESL), too many students switch in the first stage at VET, higher vocational education and university. The effect is decrease of motivation of youngsters, the schoolperiod extends and youth unemployment raises.It is important to all of us to work on this together in the interest of the students on their way to qualifications in VET, Higher vocational education and university, in the interest of good qualified staff at schools, in the interest of a well functioning labour market.The endproduct \"toolbox Outside in, Inside out\" will be of great value to support schools in preparing the students for the next step!

During this time more than 100 students and 10 teachers have been taking part in student mobilities and staff training abroad.\r\nPerho is one of the founding members of the CHASE network,  which has been operating for 27 years now. The network comprises 18 vocational schools in 15 European countries and has annually taken new members and countries to develop its activities and disseminate good practices. Foreign partners represent a broad range of languages and cultures and are reliable actors (many of them AEHT members). Gastronomic diversity is well taken into account when establishing the network. The colleges of the network represent traditional regional gastronomy. This gives students and staff a good opportunity to deepen their own gastronomy and customer service expertise. In 2016  Lapland Vocational College REDU joined the National Consortium. REDU has diverse experience in different international networks and is an expert in Ecvet.\r\n\r\nInternationality, digitality and entrepreneurship are the strategic highlights recorded in the operating plan. The Internationalization strategy is seen as a strengthening of the vision and contributes to the understanding and respect of multiculturalism and diversity. In accordance with the Internationalization Strategy, students' capacity for internationalization and mobility is promoted and the organization's level of expertise is increased. Our mission is to educate qualified and multi-skilled service professionals in a borderless and digitalized learning environment, which also promotes sustainable development, internationality and entrepreneurship. International mobilities are included in the student's Personal Competence Development Plans (HOKS). The iPerho e-learning campus, which is being developed during the project, supports and enables the students' individual learning paths to be realized. All students have a Personal Competence Development Plan (HOKS), which is updated during the studies. A module for international exchange serving students will be built for the campus, where the student receives information about the exchange and where the services are provided digitally, for example chat, blogs and guidance. The module works as a connecting contact platform where students can exchange experiences with each other and receive guidance. The iPerho e-learning campus will provide modules for core subjects, that students can also complete abroad, which speeds up their graduation. The on-the-job learning teacher is pedagogically present at the iPerho e-learning campus, where communication, guidance and evaluation will be documented.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the National Consortium is to produce a common process for the international Personal Competence Development Plan in accordance with the legislation on the reform of vocational education and training. The implementation and evaluation of HOKS will be ensured by Advance Planning Visits.\r\n\r\nThe international network's assessment competence (materials, guidance, evaluation and evaluation documentation) is guided in the directions required by Ecvet and the reform of vocational education,  especially taking into account the Learning Agreement for student's personal learning objectives and in particular ensuring their realization. The Consortium works as a mentor for the CHASE network partners, who do not have any experience and knowledge of Ecvet.\r\n\r\nPerho, Stao and REDU offer 5, 4 and 3 months ErasmusPro long term mobilities for 44 students (restaurant, bakery, tourism and business) in the CHASE network. A long on-the-job learning enables new working methods and raw materials, language and work culture to be learned. What is new in this project is that exchanges are also offered for adult learners / apprentices. The project's reciprocal 5 and 4-month student exchanges are started in all countries simultaneously in two different flows during the academic year. Both flows will be started in the host country by a four-week language and cultural preparation organized by the host institution, after which the host institution will organize a supervised on-the-job learning for students.

These numbers also support the strategic aim of giving equal opportunities for students as the mobilities last from14-140 days. The shorter periods are planned for apprentices, entrepreneurs and students with families and 10 short mobilities for media students to study as a group in Plymouth, and 5 students from the preparatory training programs to Denmark.., whereas the mobilities applied under the category Erasmus+ pro are for studyfields where the work includes projects, these mobilities also give a chance to test the adjustability of the process in the Chase network to the general mobilities.\r\n\r\nThe legislative changes in vocational education strive to rethink the process, documents and international path curriculum offered. It also asks for new procedures and careful planning in guidance and for the validation of competences obtained during the practical training periods abroad.\r\n\r\nThe staff mobilities will reinforce the international competences in the everyday life of the college and are seen as a mean for pedagogical development and execution of the reform of vocational education in Finland. The staff will be given an equal chance to apply to these periods abroad on an electronic form. The programs of staff mobilities will be based on the needs of the sector. They will enhance the quality of vocational training and execution of the student mobilities.\r\n\r\nA memorandum of understanding has been negociated between the partners till the year 2020.

Today the project relies on a well-established transnational partnership, which is large, diverse and competent.\r\nThe project is carried out within the CHASE network (Consortium of Hospitality&Accommodation Schools of Europe),of which the Carnacina has been part for 12 years and which currently includes 19 members, mostly Hospitality and Catering VET Colleges, both sending and receiving on a reciprocal basis.\r\nBetween 1 September 2017 and 31 August 2018, the project envisages 22-week work placements in 11 countries for 27 Hospitality/Catering recent graduates, not yet employed and aiming at improving their skills in view of better employability. The selected participants, from the Verona-Lake Garda-Mantua catchment area and from possibly less advantaged socio-economic backgrounds but nevertheless highly motivated, will have acquired intermediate skills in at least 1 hospitality/catering sector and 1 foreign language.\r\nECHOS.2 aims at meeting the needs of the local and international hospitality industry to employ staff which is better vocationally qualified to cope with the new organizational challenges: in order to achieve this, traditional knowledge must be complemented with the innovative skills associated with the new Food&Beverage job profiles.\r\nThe participants' objectives are:\r\n-Enhancing vocational, communication, language, digital, entrepreneurial and soft skills for better employability\r\n-Strengthening awareness as European citizens\r\n-Acquiring tools for lifelong learning.\r\nThe accurate preparation in Italy and abroad is crucial for the smooth running of WBL: it includes pedagogical-cultural induction, social programmes, workshops, intensive English courses and courses in the specific target-languages (OLS and classroom learning). Besides, an approach to key topics (food safety and hazards - innovative interpretations of traditional cuisine) as well as to nutrition awareness, environmental sustainability, social inclusion, active citizenship,equal opportunities, all common themes to CHASE projects.\r\nWhen abroad, the participants attend 4-week induction at the host institutions, in multiethnic groups; subsequently they are placed in selected establishments for 4 months, in the Food Production or Front-of-House sectors. School tutors along with industrial mentors guarantee that Learning Agreements are complied with and the agreed LOs are reached.\r\nThe positive results of past mobility experiences lead us to believe that this project will also have a similar impact both on employability and on the international dimension of our strategic plan for education and training, thanks to its strong points:\r\n-Long-term mobilities (22 w.)\r\n-Prep activities in Italy and abroad (4 w.)\r\n-Wide and diverse partnership (12)\r\n-VET schools/industry interaction to assist recent vocational graduates in college-to-work transition in a highly motivating transnational context\r\n-High quality WBL, guaranteed by past performance, tutors and the reliability/experience brought into the project by partners who are all personally known\r\n-Shared recognition of skills, achieved through synergy with industry, also using ECVET tools\r\n-Partner organizations with a strong European internationalization vision\r\n-Learning in as many as 11 target-languages and improving English as a lingua franca\r\n-Engagement in quality management\r\n-Sustainability.\r\n\r\nECHOS.2 is implemented within the thoroughly tested and accredited framework detailed above.

This vocational training period has to be completed in order to pass the European standard BTECH diploma in Cookery and Catering, and provides the students with a mobility opportunity abroad, an opening into European Multicultural Citizenship and development of their vocational and linguistic skills. These students, who are registered in the second year of the three year European B Tech, in the Cookery, Service and Restaurant modules have already undertaken a first year Vocational BTECH. They comprise 2 classes of 24 students.  The first group will go to work placements in Europe in September 2014, the second group will have their training period in March - April 2015, The next class, of 48 students, will be divided in half so 24 will be sent in September - October 2015 and the others 24 in March - April 2016. In total 96 students, both boys and girls will benefit from these mobilities. The pupils are often quite young and some have challenging social backgrounds. The financial support from Erasmus+ contributes to a good quality, well-structured training opportunity.Since 2004, we have been building a network of receiving hotels in Ireland, Scotland and Estonia and have worked hard to establish these contacts. These European countries were chosen for ease of access from France, The receiving partners are all high quality hotels and restaurants.The aim of our students is to pass their Vocational B TECH and to obtain the Europass certificate. After being prepared for the mobility, the students, travelling in pairs, are supervised and monitored by our local partners. The receiving hotels or resturaants keep in touch with the tutor in charge of the project. Teachers from the Lyc\u00e9e visit to assess the trainee. The budget is established taking into account Erasmus funding, the contribution of partner companies, the Lyc\u00e9e, family and a financial grant from the Region Ile de France. The activities and results of the project are widely disseminated in newspapers, and websites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivity 2: Consists of a 5 month European mobility which is suitable for students who have just passed a diploma in the Cookery and Catering sector and having now a CAP, a Vocational B TECH or a Technology BTECH. They are enrolled in a complementary local initiative training - FCIL: Adaptability to Cooking and Catering Trade in Europe and Abroad (Adaptation aux M\u00e9tiers de l'H\u00f4tellerie en Europe et \u00e0 l'International).Our participants are mainly from the Paris area and they come from modest social backgrounds. They require financial and an organisational help. Our aims are to prepare our students to adapt to diverse cultural and vocational situations to enrich their lives. This project aims to further their vocational and social integration into the world of work and to familiarize them with applying a Lifelong Learning training. At our Lyc\u00e9e, our involvement in European programmes is part of the \"European and International Opening\" axis of our school project. This international dimension is likely to enhance our desirability in terms of recruitment and employability, contributing to the excellent reputation of our training and enhance the positive image of our school. Our project is supported by the strong C.H.A.S.E Network (Consortium of Hospitality and Accommodation Schools Schools of Europe) which is now of 24 years standing and has 14 partner catering schools or institutions located in 13 European countries: Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Finland , Ireland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, and Turkey. It is thanks to this network that the mobility projects can be realised; the wide range of European destinations has a strong attraction for students wanting to participate. In order to coordinate our activities, improve communication and to make long-lasting partnerships, a annual meeting is organized where we decide on a joint focus for the project e,g, this year we chose: Awareness of Health and Nutrition in the Cookery and Catering sector in Europe, The mobilities last for five months. During the first 4 weeks there is a period of cultural and linguistic training to prepare the students for their internships in hotels or restaurants. During the four months internship students are accommodated in the hotel or in nearby hostels or apartments. Students have a nominated supervisor in the hotel or restaurant placements and are also monitored by a tutor from the receiving partner and from the Lyc\u00e9e, the sending organisation. To be able to finance this invaluable learning project we depend on the contribution from Europe - the share of the ERASMUS + grant being only 28.4% of the total budget.

With these international competences Helsinki Vocational College aims to meet the needs of the increasingly multicultural working life.The strategic aim is that every student and Staff member is aware of the possibilities given to gain international competences and have an equal opportunity to participate in the international activities and mobility periods. This projects aims to develop mobility periods to take better into consideration the skills and competences of the different students. It aims to find ways to encourage students to participate also in fields of studies where the students are not voluntarily participating in student exchange.  The equal opportunity asks for a transparent process of selection of the participants in this project. The main criteria are, that the candidate is willing to learn and has sufficient skills and willingness to adjust and cope.  The mobility periods applied for staff aims to evolve pedagogical and guidance practices, develop the participating staffs vocational field and improve the recognition of learning outcomes. The competences gained will be beneficial for the implementation of the ECVET system in student mobilities. It is believed that the participating staff will be more prepared to meet students from a variety of backgrounds as well be more willing to encourage students to participate in international activities. Mobility periods are seen as a process that includes preparation, implementation and evaluation. The aim of the preparatory activities is that the student is aware of all the documentation needed, personal learning goals and has adequate knowledge to make the travel preparations and to manage once abroad.The Strategic aim of Helsinki Vocational College is that these mobility periods are a recognized part of the participant\u2019s studies. The recognition of these mobilities is based on the implementation of the ECVET from the preparation till the evaluation.Mobility periods are documented and each participant is asked to write a report of their experiences.

The other network is for bakery and butchery schools in Europe, where we have cooperated for more than 15 years. 14 teachers and 10 staff participate in the project, length: one week.Our participants receive a higher degree of intercultural competences in the project by broadening their persepective and understanding for various cultures and languages, which makes them better citizens, who understand the migration situation better. They deepen their knowledge and critical thinking when meeting various cultures and migrants at the host school and learn how they are integrated in the organisations. The project helps the participants to understand the difficulties, that might occur for migrants to adapt to a new country, but highlights also problems, that can occur for our students to adapt to a new culture and work culture at placements.  The project presents a European Labour market to the students to prevent unemployment among youngsters, where one, in spite of background, has a chance for employment. In the project we communicate in English, which improves and deepens the language competences of the participants. Meeting another language and culture increases understanding and tolerance for other cultures, also at home. The interest to learn other languages, except English, increases among the participants. The students compare their culture with their host country, which makes them more aware of pros and cons between the countries. They study equality, gender equality, migration, integration, etnicity and religion, in their host country, which  increases their critical thinking in a positive way along with understanding migrants in Europe, and other cultures back home.The students mature and become more responsible. They develop their professional skills, which make them better employees both at home and in Europe. They create their own networks meeting young people in the host school and at the placements.Our teachers and staff increase their professional skills, as well, through job-shadowing and in pedagogical discussions with European colleagues. They teach students at the host schools and try their own pedagogical methods on them, and receive new insipration from European colleagues in the teaching field. One part of the pedagogical discussions will include food and beverage labels and their contents, and how to teach students to avoid the greatest hazards. One of the objectives in the project is quality assurance of the ECVET work, which began in the last Erasmus project; the use of MoU and Learning Agreeement in a more efficient way to increase transparency more between the organisations also when assessing students, despite the different schoolsystems.

During their placement in the host countries, the practical and theoretical preparations continue during an induction month in the host organisation followed by a 4-month long placement in quality hotels/restaurants chosen by the host organisation. During the induction month the students receive language, culture and food culture preparation, both in theory and practice, including learning  about the labels on foods and beverages and the hazards they are exposed to.

We hold these three components dear in our school group. The European internships challenge our pupils and staff to, in team, think and work in a cross-cultural context. Doing so, pupils and staff discover and use new techniques and the most modern tools. They learn how to communicate efficiently and in a (media) responsible way.\r\n\r\nConcrete, within our internationalization strategy, we actively continue working on an increase in the number of departments and fields of study that get access to European internships and trainings (e.g. within the food department: confectioner/pastry baker-chocolate making & processing, pastry & caterer; within the people care department: youth care and care for people with disabilities; within the wood and construction department: building sciences; ), a further increase in the number of mobilities, combined with a further strengthening of our qualitatively high internship network, an increased accessibility and democratization for all motivated potential participants.\r\n\r\nAccompanying persons\r\nBecause the pupils in traineeship are of minor age, the Danish and one Swedish partner demand the pupils to be accompanied by a teacher of KOGEKA.

These actions support the school\u2019s vision and strengthens and promotes sustainable development such as understanding and respecting multiculturalism and diversity. Internationality is a natural part of everyday school activities. Students' capacity for internationalization and international mobility is supported, which also promotes the rise of organization's level of know-how. Work placements abroad enable different kinds of learning environments and individual learning pathways for students. Incoming international students bring in know-how and increase the internationalization in the school. Organization\u2019s strategy for internationalization includes finding new partnerships and increasing possibilities for international mobility to meet the students\u2019 increasing interest and need for international experience. The development discussions of the staff have shown that teachers have gaps in international expertise, as well as the need for language skills and IT skills development. Also ECVET knowledge is insufficient, consequently the teachers familiar with the principles of ECVET before the exchange period. Teachers are trained to use electronic means like Skype in accordance with the development plan for the staff, which enables for example vocational skills demonstration assessment in real-time for students abroad. The curriculum team's task is to develop the international dimension of the curriculum and make reforms according to Ecvet.The project is coordinated by Helsinki Culinary School Perho while Helsinki Vocational College and Lapland Tourism College are acting as domestic partners. The project is carried out with the International CHASE Network, which consists of 22 hospitality and catering colleges around Europe. Most of the colleges act both as a sending and a receiving partner. The Network has been operating for 25 years and represents a wide range of different language and cultural areas. From the gastronomic point of view, the colleges represent traditional European regional gastronomy. Gaining know-how and skills from the traditional European gastronomy strengthens the participants\u2019 possibilities for employment and success in labor market.The participants of the project are teachers and primary and upper secondary based students, who study a vocational qualification. The two-year project provides 40 students with the possibility of 4-5 months exchange and 14 teachers with 12 days, and 2 teachers with 5 weeks training abroad. The student exchange consists of a 4 -week language and cultural training in the host college and of on-the-job learning. During the exchange period the students learn skills needed in the internationalizing working life in addition to the professional skills. International work skills include different languages, networking and acting in a multicultural environment as well as different working cultures and customs. The skills and learning outcomes acquired abroad are validated and recognized as part of the qualification. The project makes use of Europass Certificate Supplement, Europass CV and Europass Mobility Document.The teacher training abroad strengthens professional skills and international competences. Teacher exchanges aim to take place in the same restaurants, where the students are placed. This will strengthen the assessment know-how in the work placements towards the ECVET-principles. The assessment documents tested in the previous project will be developed further. The teacher exchange takes place, when the students start their on-the-job learning. Teachers familiarize the staff in the work placement with the vocational skills demonstrations and the assessment targets such as the knowledge, the skills and the  competence of the student. The teacher organizes the vocational skills demonstration assessment via Skype in the end of the student\u2019s on-the-job leaning.In the annual collaboration meeting The CHASE network agreed on a common project theme ECVET.

More precisely, these experiences have always been internships in the food and nutrition sector. Students from the 'kitchen and service' and the bakery and butcher programs are able to apply for these internships. The 'Chase-Network' started 25 years ago with England, France and Sweden. The Network has since expanded to include 18 partners, 15 different countries and our school has been an active member for 15 years.Every exchange runs for a period of 5 months. Students are guided and assisted by one of the partnerschools. Every country selects, sends and receives students (except Iceland, Scotland and Tenerife,  they only receive). During the first month of their stay, students get acquainted with their hosts and the country. A very thorugh language course is combined with cultural excursions, company visits and practical lessons in the hosting school.At all times during their stay, students are assisted and guided by one of the local coordinators or teachers. After the first month follows a 4 month internship in one of the companies, hotels or restaurants selected by the hosting school. During this period the students remain in close contact with their hosts and their own school. For many of them this is their first long stay abroad and the contact with a known partner works both motivating and reassuring. The very important personal contact between the schools is equally important as it allows for quick and easy communication (in case any problems arise).Beside the long term project we started a short term project. The students themselves are the requesting party . Some of them would like to do their practical work-placement abroad during their last school-year.

It offers a wide range of training from age 14 years old upwards, from entry level to professional courses and postgraduate qualifications. The apprenticeship is strongly connected with educating students in Poland. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe priority is the effective professional training and shaping characters and the key skills gained during the European training. Together with the opening of our new faculties (architecture renovation technician, roof worker) it is necessary for our students to get new competence and work skills which are in the core curriculum. It will help them to be more self-confident and more mobile in the work market, both in the homeland and abroad.\r\n\r\nWhat is more, it is also equally important for the students of building engineering to broaden their skills and knowledge practically and theoretically by using new European technologies.

After the first month follows a 4 month internship in one of the companies, hotels or restaurants selected by the hosting school. During this period the students remain in close contact with their hosts and their own school.

They also learn how to handle their own finances and learn basic skills of life. The self-controlled and goal-oriented use of social media before, during and after the mobilities increases the knowledge of the responsibilities and rules of digital communication and 21st century skills. The aim of the project is not only to increase professional skills but also simultaneously interactive and life-management skills of our students.  This happens with the construction of vocational student identity, flexibility, empathy and solidarity in a professional framework; mobilities are ideal environments for this kind of process. The project partners in the mobility have been chosen keeping in mind the key competences and the aims of this project and include colleges, companies,  and intermediary partners with good local connections.\r\nThe project aims to include as many vocational fields as possible and to provide positive and constructive experiences of mobility for special needs vocational students.\r\nThe learner mobilities will be carried out in following vocational studies: household and cleaning services, dance, music, property maintenance, catering and cook services, warehouse, customer service and sales, and vehicle mechanic.\r\nTwo week  learner mobilities will be carried out as group  mobilities with always at least one accompanying person.  Accompanying persons are able to provide support during the whole moblity period. The support provided by the sending organisation is extremely important in order to carry out succesful mobilities.

The main theme of the project is to increase students\u2019 not only professional skills and competence but also social and communication as well as life management skills. This is taken into account in every stage of the project. Project partners have been chosen for the mobility keeping in mind the acquisition of the key competences.  Although  most of the partners are colleges, many of them can provide on-the-job placements during the mobilities. This may be in the units provided by the college (for example Hotel, confectionery or deli shop) or the on-the-job placements (local metal companies) outside the college. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to involve as many vocational study fields, especially technical fields, to mobilities  as possible and provide the mobility experiences to students with special needs.  The target groups of the project are students in following fields: nursing, media and communications, painting, household and cleaning services, maintenance, catering, metalwork and machinery, dance, music, interior decorating and information and telecommunication technology. Previous student mobilities of Keskuspuisto have been carried out mainly in the catering department.  The accompanying persons can provide support during the whole mobility period as the mobilities will be carried out as group mobilities. The support offered by the sending organization (Keskuspuisto college) is extremely important in order to carry out successful mobilities. \r\n\r\nAll 56 students attending to the mobilities have special education needs (see attached the classification of students at KVC in annex 1).

On these grounds the main objectives of the project have emerged:\r\n- Gaining a relevant practical experience, by instructing for two weeks 21 students from the three specializations through internships in England;\r\n- Raising by 50 % the number of students from the technological branch who will apply for the upper secondary school\r\n- Enlisting all 21 participants in the Level 4 Professional Competences Certification \r\n- Raising by 25% of the degree of employability for the three specializations within the next three years\r\n- At least 10 of the 21 participating students will carry on learning in the tertiary education, within the next three years.\r\nThe internship will take place from the 11th to 22nd of June 2018 at our English partner \u2013 City College Plymouth and will consist of specific activities, according to the Romanian Training Standards and the level of education of the participants. The content of the activities that will be conducted during the mobility has already been negotiated and settled in the partnership and can be found in the working schedule. The main activities through which the participants will gain the learning outcomes are:\r\nFor the Mechanic specialization: doing mechanical measurements, drawing up and interpreting the technical documents, choosing materials, the semi-products, the tools and the devices needed to do the mechanical works, doing simple pieces and checking the quality of the products they made.\r\nFor the Electro-mechanic specialization: doing electrical measurements for different circuits; doing simple electrical circuits, checking their functionality, assemble and disassemble simple lighting installations. \r\nFor the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection: classifying and identifying the main environmental pollution sources, sampling, analyzing and dosing the pollutants of the environment; filling in the sampling sheets and the analysis reports; investigating and finding solutions to repel the ecosystem pollution.\r\nThe internship will be validated by issuing the Europass mobility document and acknowledged in the country by grades in the classes of practical preparation.\r\nAn important factor in the quality of the project is the fact that we are at the fourth collaboration with the English partner and it has a rich experience in offering educational and professional development services, at high European standards.\r\nThe two institutions have signed a Memorandum of Understanding whose purpose is using the ECVET instruments.\r\nThe cooperation and communication with the English College representatives have ensured coherence in preparing the project and offers security and stability in its future evolution.\r\nThe impact of the project will be noticed in its added value in the personal and professional development of the participants, it will contribute to developing skills and competences corresponding to the 3 specializations, but also forming new ones, by doing what they are asked to in conditions as similar as possible to a real job.\r\nThe immediate, visible and measurable results will consist of increasing the number of students from the lower secondary school who will apply for the upper secondary school, decreasing absenteeism, as well as increasing the number of students who will apply for the exam of Level 4 professional Competences Certification.\r\nThe participating students will gain more skills, ability in implementing the techniques and doing the activities specific to the job they train for. They will become more confident, more independent and mature, they will have more confidence in themselves and will be more successful in finding a job according to their expectations, they will improve their linguistic and cultural competences.\r\nThe sustainability of the project is ensured by the continuing collaboration with our English partner by conducting more partnership projects, KA1 and KA2.", "http://www.cityplym.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-RO01-KA102-035799_1"], [2015, "Catering Mobility in Europe - 25 years of European Cooperation in the CHASE network", "City College Plymouth", 47681.0, 14, 17, "For 25 years we have been supporting young people on the labour marktet in the catering business. \r\nWe are partner in the C.H.A.S.E. network that means we send and receive students in gastronomy in over 25 Countries. \r\nThe partners of the network meet annually to discuss and determine the standards of the programme. \r\n In this mobility we offer a 4-week- course of language teaching, practical and theoretical studies as well as cultural information and a lot of sightseeing tours.\r\nAfter  that period the students get a placement according to their business they are trained for and their abilities and interests.

(CCI-number: 2007 HU 161 PO 004). Among its specific aims, the II. priority axis places special emphasis on developments related to tourism. It is crucial to host as many guests as possible and to provide them with the necessary services so that they could be satisfied. The increasing number of guest nights can only be achieved with high standard hospitality.

During their foreign placement the trainees can get to know new technologies, spices and seasonings. They will be working with ingredients which are only rarely used in Hungary such as: special seafood, snails; they can also collect recipes, which could be shared with their classmates and their VET teachers. \r\nBefore mobilities we provide a one-month preparatory course for our students, which includes language, vocational language, cultural and psychological training. A centralised online scheme provided by the European Commission will also monitor the linguistic competences of the beneficiaries. The language improvement will also be checked with our tests.\r\nA special emphasis will be placed on the continuous assessment of the project, which will be done not only by the coordinator but also by the accompanying teachers, foreign mentors and the students. Our measuring tools are questionnaires of self-evaluation and satisfaction elaborated in advance.\r\nAfter the mobilities our students will give presentations in which they are going to talk about their experiences, make a poster and articles will be published in the regional press both in Hungary and abroad, interviews will be given, and an online presentation will also be placed on the website of the school. On our school open days we give presentations for the primary school leaving students and their parents. \r\nIn the end, a dissemination closing ceremony will be organized, where beyond listening to the presentations of the students, the participants can also taste some titbits prepared by our students following their recipes brought from the host countries and the beneficiaries will be also given their Europass mobility documents. \r\nWe are expecting the improvement of the foreign laguage skills and the personality development of our beneficiaries as well as the enrichment of their vocational knowledge from the programme. \r\nA longer-term effect is that the students having been abroad can fulfil the expectations set towards young employees more easily. Students can share the experiences of their four-week-mobility, their foreign vocational practice in real life work situations at home thus bringing the vocational training programmes of the VET providers and apprenticeship places up-to-date.
