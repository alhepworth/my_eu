Appearance, nutrition, texture, freshness, and spoilage are the most important quality and safety attributes of fish products. Quality inspection of fish is typically carried out manually on candling tables by human visual detection, which is very labour intensive, and many quality and safety attributes are invisible to the inspectors. It is also subjective and dependent on the experience and criteria of the inspectors. Available traditional instrumental measurements are destructive, expensive, time-consuming and inefficient. Moreover, they cannot provide spatial distribution information of desired attributes, critical for evaluating the quality and safety of fish products.\nIn this project, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology will be applied for quantitative and non-invasive measurement and visualisation of quality and safety of finfish fillets. Combining the main advantages of spectroscopy and computer vision, HSI can simultaneously acquire spectral and spatial information in one single system, enabling it to measure both external physical and morphological characteristics and internal quality attributes from a finfish product. A reliable HSI system with numerous quantitative models will be trained, established, and validated for rapid and non-invasive measurement of quality and safety attributes of finfish fillets based on the most critical image features extracted from visible and invisible (near infrared) hyperspectral images of finfish fillets and their reference attribute values, which will be measured by using traditional instruments and sensory analysis.\nThis development brings a major advance to the EU finfish industry for ensuring the safe processing of finfish products and the correct labelling of products in relation to quality, safety, authenticity and compliance.", 153865.0, 1154241.0, 5, 8, "SPECTRAFISH", "http://spectrafish.eu/", "http://www.freshseal-limited.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/157112.jpg", "fp7_110396_998754196"], [1346457600000, 1409443200000, "Novel microwave-assisted vacuum drying for heat sensitive foods", "Freshseal Limited", "'Heat sensitive foods and products that possess excellent quality in terms of taste, aroma, texture, and appearance, such as herbs, spices, seafood, etc., pose a major challenge to food driers. Products such as garlic, ginger, spring onions and shrimps are cellular tissues containing gas-filled pores that tend to collapse when subjected to dehydration. This collapse is more noticeable with prolonged exposure to elevated drying temperatures, such as those used in convective drying. For this reason, hot air drying results in substantial degradation in quality attributes such as colour, nutrients and flavour, sever shrinkage also reduces bulk density and dehydration capacity. Also, chemical changes causing loss of flavour and nutrients occur during convective drying so the properties of dehydrated products are poor. A number of drying techniques have been developed over the years, among them atmospheric forced-air dehydration, a very common method. The major disadvantage of the hot air convective drying of food is the low energy efficiency and lengthy drying time during the falling rate period.\n\nMILD-DRY will build on the positive results of laboratory trails using microwave-assisted vacuum drying (MAVD) for the successful dehydration of selected foods, whereby the drying time for carrots for example was reduced to 2 h compared with 4.5-8.5 h in convectional hot air drying. Moreover, dried carrots showed higher rehydration potential, higher beta-carotene and vitamin C contents, lower density, and softer texture than those prepared by air drying. Further research effort will be performed in order to optimise the approach through the intermittent as opposed to continuous application of MW in order to achieve higher energy savings and product quality enhancement. To bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial application, a prototype system will be developed for its validation in commercial food drying facilities.'", 152261.0, 1241650.0, 6, 9, "MILD-DRY", "http://www.milddry.eu/", "http://www.freshseal-limited.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159511.jpg", "fp7_104777_998754196"], [1222819200000, 1285804800000, "Method for improving the quality of frozen foods by assisting the freezing process and reducing the size of the ice crystals", "Freshseal Limited", "Freezing is a very widespread process within the food processing industry, being used not only to manufacture products that are consumed in frozen state, such as ice cream, frozen yoghurts, sorbets, etc, but also as a very important means of preserving fresh foodstuffs. However, freezing animal and plant tissues causes many irreversible physical and chemical changes within the food matrix, often leaving the final product with lower eating quality than when it was in the fresh state. Ice crystals represent one of the key contributors to quality degradation in frozen foods. As they grow in size, they exert additional stresses on fragile cellular structures and can damage emulsions and lead to negative product characteristics such as poor appearance, unacceptable texture and physical and nutritional product damage. In short, smaller ice crystals promote a better quality product and control of the crystal size distribution in the final product is one of the most important aspects for many freezing operations.  As quality issues take increasing precedence among EU consumers, a key challenge facing frozen food manufacturers is how to reposition their products as health-friendly. Consumers not only instinctively believe that fresh food tastes better than frozen food- they also see frozen foods as cheap and inferior. In response, this project will build upon promising research in the ability of high powered ultrasound (HPU) to initiate ice nucleation and to control crystal size distribution in the frozen product during solidification of liquid food. Past research has also shown promise for HPU to shorten the freezing process and lead to a product of better quality. This project will design and develop a prototype HPU system for its industrial validation in food freezing facilities.

Thanks to the completed FP7 MILD-DRY project, we have successfully demonstrated the system in a relevant environment (TRL6). Our intention now is to build on these pre-industrial results in order to scale up the technology for systematic industrial exploitation. On the one hand our versatile MILDTECH equipment will be capable of drying high value, heat sensitive foods requiring reduce drying times (40% quicker than conventional microwave vacuum dryers), resulting in lower energy (up to 80% reduction in energy consumption) and running costs, increased product throughput, as well as preservation of the nutritional value and improved quality of heat sensitive dried foods compared to conventional drying methods. On the other hand, it will be capable of reduced cooking times (e.g. while chickens can be cooked in 17 minutes vs. 1.5 hours), under a lower heat than conventional ovens resulting in less moisture loss compared to conventional ovens leading to less weight loss (10-15% savings), and at an equipment cost that is cheaper than a conventional Microwave Vacuum dryer. Our business plan is to commercialize the equipment in the global food processing industry with an industrial scale machine (3m x 1.4m x 2m) that will be targeted to food drying companies, as well as a smaller kitchen safe unit (1.4m x 1.2m x 2m) that will be targeted to catering establishments.
