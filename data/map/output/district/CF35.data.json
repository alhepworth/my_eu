The novel tells the tale of Elizabeth Williams, who \"died of a broken heart\" after being locked in a room in the house by her father to prevent her from marrying her lover. The game itself is set in present day Wales and you play as Lucy Moss, a student with a fascination in the supernatural. One weekend, she travels to Sker House, South Wales, a private residence with a macabre history which has recently been converted into a seaside inn. She plans to write an article for the university magazine about a supposed haunting, but when she arrives, she meets the landlord who seems to have a lot to hide. Soon, it becomes apparent that all is not well at Sker House. An air of oppression hangs over it, while misery, tragedy and ill-fortune are commonplace. Gradually, it becomes clear that the true depth of the mystery goes far beyond a mere historical haunting. This is a place where bad things happen, and evil lurks. Little by little Lucy falls under Sker's dark spell, and as she begins to unravel the mysteries of the past, she realizes that nothing stays buried forever.

Our aim is to develop a core scientific platform from which novel non-invasive drug delivery systems can be developed and clinically assessed. At the core of this project lies the hypothesis that microneedle assisted topical drug delivery has failed to fulfil expectations because researchers have routinely over estimated the scale of permeation enhancement possible using passive microneedle treatment and also, in general, have targeted unsuitable therapeutic molecules. This project aims to address both of these issues by developing new formulation and fabrication approaches. Combining physical disruption of the stratum corneum barrier with microneedle arrays and a number of active permeation enhancement techniques (such as iontophoresis and phonophoresis) will produce a range of novel hybrid permeation enhancement systems (HPES).  The project will focus on high potency therapeutics possessing low therapeutic concentrations that make only realistic demands on delivery systems.

SGL for USaR has marshaled a pan-European interdisciplinary project team to produce a well-balanced consortium of 21 partners including rescue teams, researchers and SMEs along with the support of 15 LOIs. The project is formed by eight sub-projects (work packages) running in parallel. These WPs address the development of simulation environments; the development and validation of portable devices for location operations; the development and validation of smart sensors environment for monitoring the situation under the ruins; the management of medical information, including privacy and bioethics; and finally the development of an ICT platform that will integrate all the previous data, ensure interoperability and control the flow of the information from the field to the operational center. SGL for USaR will deliver methods and guidelines, as well as, tangible prototypes: a stand-alone FIRST responder device that integrates five different location methods (five in one); a networked rapid casualty location system (REDS) equipped with wireless sensor probes; an advanced environmental simulator for training and testing search and rescue units, including canine teams; and a prototype mobile operational command and control platform. These solutions can be also applied in security applications and thus they can create additional commercial opportunities.", 47864.0, 5433399.0, 11, 22, "SGL FOR USAR", "http://www.sgl-eu.org", null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725314.jpg", "fp7_88100_999482278"]]}}}}
