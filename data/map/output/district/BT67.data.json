The objective is to facilitate the reinsertion or the insertion for the first time of unemployed people in the labour market. Furthermore six students in risk of social exclusion take part in our Project, since training is in our opinion one of the most effective method of fighting poverty and social exclusion, and so this project contributes towards the goals of the European strategy Europe 2020. \r\nThis project gathers 75 mobility actions for students that have completed one of the following VET courses: \u201cAsistencia a la direcci\u00f3n\u201d \"Atenci\u00f3n Socio Sanitaria a personas en instituciones sociales\", \"Confecci\u00f3n y Publicaci\u00f3n de p\u00e1ginas web\", \u201cInstalaci\u00f3n y Mantenimiento de Jardines y Zonas Verdes\u201d y FME\"Operaciones Auxiliares de Servicios Administrativos y Generales\"; as wells as one of the specialisations of the workshop Empleo T'Estime 2016: \"Atenci\u00f3n Socio Sanitaria a personas en el domicilio\" and \"Gesti\u00f3n de Llamadas de Teleasistencia\" ; and also the  Escuela Taller Et Formem: \u201cActividades auxiliares en conservaci\u00f3n y mejora de montes\u201d obtaining a VET certificate.
