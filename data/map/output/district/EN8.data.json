The partners will also develop and implement necessary backend communication and media services to enable scalable, resilient and compliant call routing and recording via the internet and cloud services. The project will introduce new middleware that will link trader turrets to corporate computer systems, enabling turret functions to be accessed from enterprise applications (e.g. click-to-dial) and application data to be accessed from the turret (e.g. contacts and call groups). This will provide traders with more efficient ways to manage communications and workflow between the turret and other desktop systems. The TRADECOM turret will be designed to interoperate with Speakerbus\u2019 emerging virtual turret (vTurret) services, which will replicate the TRADECOM trader communication services on desk and mobile devices. This will enable traders to work away from their main TRADECOM turret and still access specialist voice and data communication services. An important focus of the project will be to pilot and demonstrate the integrated TRADECOM systems in real operational environments and to assess the impact for traders and trading organisations. Taken together, these innovations will disrupt the trader voice market and its large incumbent technology suppliers, and provide high growth opportunities for the SME project partners.", 1177393.0, 2041286.0, 3, 3, "TRADECOM", null, null, null, "h2020_196386_935385939"]]}}, "8UQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "What Goes Around Dance Around", "Renegade Talent", 21588.0, 3, 3, "What Goes Around Dance Around is a youth exchange programme between the United Kingdom, (through Renegade Talent), Italy (NICOLA), and France (Paragraf International) which will take place in London from the 11-17 November 2017.\r\nThe aim of the project is to enrich young people\u2019s knowledge of the origins of various dance styles, create items that reflect their cultural and social identity, and to encourage them to confidently voice their opinions.
