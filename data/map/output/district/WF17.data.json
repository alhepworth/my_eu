Those  students intend to work as agricultural technicians or farmers.\r\n    -Vocational High School Diploma \u00ab Management of Cats and Dogs breeding \u00bb which corresponds to pet courses. Those students intend to work among dogs and cats as breeder, dog handler, dog trainer in the army , the police, dog units .\r\n  -Vocational High School Diploma \u00ab Services to people and territory \u00bb which corresponds to health and social  courses. Those students intend to work as nursing auxiliary, educator, home assistant, nurse assistant.\r\n  -Vocational High School Diploma \u00ab Technician adviser in the sale of pets \u00ab corresponds to  sale of pets courses. Those students intend to work as salesmen in pet shops, garden centres\u2026\r\n\r\nIn June-July 2016, 22 students will be selected in their second year of high school to go for a training period on the ERASMUS+ 2015 program.\r\n\r\n2) The program is aimed at :\r\n21)Increasing the technical skills of our students \r\n22)Better knowing  the markets and neighbbours\u2019 savoir-faire \r\n23)Increasing mobility, enterprising mind, open-mindedness\r\n24)Developing the links school-company \r\n25)Highligting the different courses provided in our school\r\n26)Supporting the European action\r\n\r\nThe final aim of mobility is to make employment easier for our students and at the same time to arouse their citizenship on their territory,their country and Europe. \r\n\r\n3) Evaluations\r\nThe training periods abroad are part of the 14 to 16 compulsory training weeks of their Vocational High School Diploma.\r\nConcerning the Internship report ,they are not considered in the second year of high school,but in the continuous assessment.\r\n\r\nEvery European trainee will be given his \u00ab Euopass-mobility \u00bb\r\n\r\n4) New structures have become our partners\r\nOn the ERASMUS+ 2015 program, a new partner structure can be counted in our list : \r\n- LEASAPET NAVARRA : a shop which offers various services dealing with dogs : boarding kennels,  grooming, dogs products and accessories\u2026\r\n\r\nIt takes to 28 the number of partner structures that we can rely on ,with a possibility of 40 placements. (see file enclosed)\r\n\r\n5) An involved vocational high school (12 persons)\r\nWe will proceed like this :\r\n       -ENGLAND : coordination by Mrs Pascale Aramburu, assisted by Mrs Karine Garcia\r\n       -SPAIN : coordination by Mrs Augustine Gastearena ,assisted by Mrs Marie-Ange Cast\u00e8ge\r\n       -IRELAND : coordination by Mrs Patricia C\u00e9ambelar assisted by Mrs Claudine Arhancet\r\nThose 6 persons will go and help the students at the beginning and at the end of their training period.\r\n 4 other  teachers  will also be in charge of the trainees especially concerning the professional techniques.\r\nMr Christophe Gaget, headmaster and Mrs V\u00e9ronique N\u00e9quecaur ,accountant of the high school, will be in charge of the administrative and financial management .\r\n\r\n6) Our European projects change our practices at school. They involve :\r\n  6.1) the integration of the notion of european citizenship . The notion of mobility is also explained to our students in the courses of langauges and sociocultural education. That increases the number of candidates to mobility and the the desire for classes to go for study trips, in the states of  European Union.\r\n  6.2) the integration of mobility in the communication with the families concerning the pursuit of studies in our school or elsewhere. Mobility and certification are two main advantages in the recruit of students since they increase the appeal of our school.\r\n 6.3) Mobility is put forward as an argument for our students (holder of high school diploma ) in their pursuit of studies in advanced technician's certificate classes (two-year technical degree).This is all the more useful as some classes propose training periods abroad.Our former students who have already experienced a training period abroad usually go on for studies in higher education.", "http://www.fairfieldschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-014052_4"]]}}, "9PJ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1362096000000, 1425081600000, "High performance oil spill recovery system suitable to effectively operate in rough sea waters based on improved oleophilic/hydrophobic materials", "Oil Pollution Environmental Control Limited", "Force 7 aims to develop an innovative oil spill recovery system for operation in rough sea conditions.\nThe new system is based on the use of interconnected mops to create a large, wide mop net which will maximize the oil encounter rate on the surface of the sea whilst it is dragged to adsorb the slick. The system is extremely versatile because it only requires one vessel to operate and that can be any vessel of opportunity at the time of an emergency spill.\nThe mops are made by novel fibres with controlled oleophylic and hydrophobic behaviour in order to absorb large quantities of oil and increase the recovery efficiency.  Once the mops are saturated they are recovered onboard of the vessel and squeezed through a roller system: the oil collected is then stored and the mops are deployed again for another cycle.  Traditional systems, in comparison, are characterised by lower performance in terms of oil recovery and cannot be used in harsh sea conditions, which are typically encountered in case of ship wreckage and often characterize the cold seas.\nProject objectives are related to the development of the oleophylic and hydrophobic fibre materials of the mop and the related treatments, the optimisation and production of the mops, and the development of the overall oil spill recovery system for field demonstration.\nFour SMEs constitute the core of the Project, representing the whole supply chain for the oil spill recovery end product. SMEs are supported by three RTDs providing the necessary experience in the field of technical textiles, engineering and oil spill responding services. SMEs will benefit 100% of project exploitable results, in a scheme that will provide full return of investment within 3 years by the end of the project.", 4211.0, 1173713.0, 4, 7, "Force7", null, "http://www.opec.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20141119135950.jpg", "fp7_106833_952516624"]]}}}}
