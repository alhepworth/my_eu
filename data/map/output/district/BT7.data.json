The innovative Time for Change programme for young people developed in the UK , will be transferred to other member states during the lifetime of this project. This project addresses the needs of young people who are most at risk of being economically inactive, and are more at risk of social exclusion, by involving young people who are severely disadvantaged. The Time for Change uses a unique blend of intensive one to one work with group activities and challenging outdoor environments and activities to provide young participants with space way from their normal environment where they can start to consider the changes that they want to make to their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge for Youth developed this programme to work with young people from very disadvantaged areas of Belfast.

Other problems confronting young people who took part included family breakdoewn, severe poverty and problems with addictive or self-harming behaviours. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rationale behind the transfer of this project is that young people who face particular social disadvantage are at even higher risk of not having access to/becoming removed from: education, training, employment, and active society \u2013 and objective is a concern for all EU member states. Currently, 5.5 million young people are unemployed in the EU, meaning that 1 in 5 people under 25 who are willing to work cannot find a job. The unemployment rate among young people is over 20% \u2013 double the rate for all age groups combined and nearly 3 times the rate for the over-25s, and 7.5 million people aged 15 to 24 are currently neither in a job nor in education or training. In addition, due to Europe\u2019s current economic climate, the mobility of learners and youth is of paramount importance and it could be argues that access to mobility is even more important for those facing the most disadvantaged and risk of social exclusion. In order to have access to mobility, however, young people must have the skills to enable them to undertake training, education, or work experience. Through the transfer of the Time for Change Programme this project seeks to create opportunities and address the needs of young people most at risk of becoming excluded from socio-economic activities while establishing the basic core competencies need to move into education, work, or training. This project seeks to directly address these issues by working with young people aged 16 \u2013 25 who are most at risk or already defined in these categories.

Chronic bacterial pulmonary infection leading to an irreversible decline in lung structure and function is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with CF, with more than 95% of deaths due to respiratory failure. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the most frequently isolated pathogen, chronically infecting up to 80% of adult patients. When this occurs patients require lifelong inhaled antibiotic therapy, which although onerous to take, has been fundamental in increasing life expectancy by suppressing infection, reducing exacerbations and preserving lung function in CF patients chronically infected with Pa. Studies employing enhanced culture techniques and culture-independent molecular approaches have recently shown that the lungs of CF patients harbour diverse polymicrobial communities, the \u201cmicrobiome\u201d. Other Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria (GNnF), including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteria from the genera Burkholderia, Achromobacter, Acinetobacter, Ralstonia and Pandoraea may be present and contribute to disease. Moreover, Burkholderia cenocepacia is associated with rapid deterioration of lung function and poor clinical outcome.  \n\nEstimates for the prevalence of non-CF bronchiectasis (BE) range from 4 per 100 000 in young adults to nearly 300 per 100,000 in persons 75 years and older in developed countries. The number of adults is increasing significantly and the forecast is that the number of adults with CF will increase by 100% between 2010 and 2025. These individuals will mostly have chronic infection with Pa. \n\nIndividuals with BE have chronic cough and sputum production and frequent respiratory infections which lead to impaired lung function and health-related quality of life. Chronic infection with Pa affects 12\u201327% of adults with BE and is associated with an increased exacerbation frequency, an accelerated decline in lung function, hospital admissions and increased mortality. There is a direct relationship between bacterial load, airway inflammation and risk of exacerbation supporting the use of long-term administration of inhaled antibiotics in BE. \n\nCurrently, a limited number of inhaled antimicrobials are available for use in CF with no antibiotics approved to treat lung infection in patients with BE. As median predicted survival of CF birth cohorts is now greater than 40 years, adherence to consensus treatment guidelines requires that chronically infected patients are treated for decades with inhaled antimicrobials. Furthermore, bacteria causing respiratory infection are becoming progressively more resistant to conventional antibiotics with up to 45% of CF patients colonised with multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. New antibiotics with activity against such respiratory pathogens are urgently needed.  \n\nThe iABC-consortium (inhaled Antibiotics in Bronchiectasis and Cystic fibrosis) brings together world leading collaborative researchers to develop new antibiotic treatment options for people with CF and BE by sharing expertise and resources.

However, there are presently no vaccines for any animal or human helminth pathogen.\nWe hypothesise that the ability of helminth parasites to suppress the protective arm of the immune response explains why we have been unsuccessful in developing efficacious vaccines against these pathogens. During helminth infection the function of innate immune cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, is manipulated by the parasite to create a T helper (Th) cell 2-driven immune response that is beneficial to its survival, while simultaneously suppressing the immunoprotective Th1-driven response.

My recent work has concluded the controversial result that there may be more than one way to produce SNe Ia. As SN Ia cosmology samples reach higher precision, understanding subtle differences in their properties becomes increasingly important. A surprising diversity in white-dwarf explosions has also been uncovered, with a much wider-than-expected range in luminosities, light-curve timescales and spectral properties.

In the seventeenth century, the small numbers of radical Catholics and Protestants who favoured imposing their own version of Christianity on others by force were accused by moderates (no less religiously sincere) within their own communities of promoting wars incompatible with Christian orthodoxy. Religious faith, the moderates insisted, was a supernatural thing, a gift of God, rather than a natural thing, a creation of rational humans, and thus could not be imposed by force. Arguments for religious war in the sense of evangelisation by force were thus resisted by most of the educated European elite. These debates among university-based Catholic and Protestant intellectuals took place in the Latin language and are insufficiently known to political historians of early modern Europe. Political historians examining the phenomenon of early modern religious war impose the modern categories of sacred (which they associate with the irrational) and secular (which they posit must be drained of the divine) on the past, mistakenly assuming that those who opposed evangelisation by force were somehow more secular than their opponents and composing a false history of secularisation.\nThis project will analyse, translate, edit, and publish these scholastic debates between religious militants and religious moderates on the role of force in religious life in order to inform and re-shape arguments among political historians on the nature of religious warfare.

National as well as European legislation supporting eAccessibility is in place and the UN-Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the most powerful, global expression in support of Inclusion and Equality, has a clear focus on eAccessibility, AT and Design for All. Media Accessibility has long been a critical issue in the EU culture sector, and EC has funded many projects regarding creation and distribution of eAccessibility. The time has come to establish the new professional profile of media accessibility expert/manager, and its training. Full participation of all citizens in cultural events - as end users or participants - should become part of their daily life as for people without disabilities, restoring the concept of equal opportunity and Human Right of access to culture.\r\n\r\nThe project ACT proposes the definition of a new professional profile, that of the \"Media Accessibility Expert/Manager for the Scenic Arts\", and also the various types of training activities associated to this professional. The project proposes a multisectorial team, pooling on expertise and working in a common practical project to draw the skills, competences and learning materials required.

Several end user associations have signed a letter wishing to participate in the project. More theatres will also participate in the project, since the objective is a priority in their policy.\r\n\r\nThe first step will be to profile accessibility issues for the events and users. In other words, an analysis of specificities of various cultural venues when wanting to implement an active cultural accessibility policy in the field of live and dynamic scenic arts, and also an analysis of the various user profiles accessing and taking part in these venues. Profiling will be done in all four countries and with many users This transnational analysis, in which various languages, genres, technologies and venues will be considered, will strengthen cooperation between organisations in different but complementary sectors that will exchange best practices. Simultaneously, an intensive dialogue with the authorities will be opened to discuss the best way to implement accessibility policies in the scenic arts, focusing on Catalonia and Flanders but extrapolating its results to other scenarios. Cooperation between regional authorities will be fostered and strengthened.\r\n\r\nThis initial event and profiling, plus the expertise gathered by the HEIs in accessibility training, will allow to define a new professional profile that responds to an emerging market need: that of the so-called \"expert/manager in accessibility for the scenic arts\".\r\n\r\nThe main competences and skills of this new professional profile, along with its denomination, will be discussed and agreed upon by the various stakeholders. \r\n\r\nAn open learning proposal, more specifically a MOOC, will be developed.  ACT will foster recognition and validation of knowledge, skills and competences acquired through this open learning. Before its launching, the MOOC will be designed, tested in a pilot course and disseminated in dedicated workshops. A showcase will be used as a testing scenario for the implementation of the skills acquired through the course. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, an accredited learning curriculum will be discussed and proposed for future implementation in the HEIs partners. Special emphasis will be put on the permeability of others types of learning with formal education pathways.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on promoting equal opportunities and accessibility to cultural events (scenic arts) across countries and languages searching to establish and qualify the profile of accessibility expert to empower all citizens and especially people with disabilities.

These objectives are more specifically defined in the so called Modernisation Agenda (EC 2011). More specifically it sets a goal to improve the quality and relevance of higher education. In this process external evaluation and self-assessment are seen in a key role!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there are plenty of methods for both self- and cross-evaluation, there is a lack of models for a comprehensive approach, taking account the needs to increase international collaboration and improve international comparability in HEIs.  There have been many European projects on QA, but they do not cover still existing problems with accreditation such as required resources, complexity, delays between the evaluation rounds, poor feedback, poor quality loop and distance from continuous education development. There is a need for more flexible evaluation models and processes with peers to reduce the inertia of heavy accreditations/evaluations in HEIs. Contemporary processes are too laborious and increasingly demanding, binary evaluation lacks feedback on how to improve, and moreover, more and more reporting is demanded. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQAEMarketPlace4HEI -project proposes a flexible and collaborative method, processes and tools for degree program / higher education evaluation, as a complement for weighty/ponderous accreditations. The innovativeness of the project lies in the collaborative model of quality assurance that can complement accreditations and existing QA systems. The project promotes and strengthens the European cooperation in quality assurance while designing and piloting new kind of continuous, accessible, cooperation based model, tools and a virtual platform (the Market Place) supporting so called cross-sparring between institutions. Cross-sparring is to be understood as a process to make feedback more collaborative, concrete and objective, thanks to critical, but discreet brainstorming sessions, where strategies can be discussed, repeatedly contributing to the quality assurance with a critical external view. As in sport, a sparring partner helps to keep eyes on the objectives, learn from experience and stimulate reflectivity. This approach is beneficial both for the institution evaluated, which will get a more objective view on its strengths and potential improvements, and for the sparring partner which may identify best practices that can be useful for his own institution. The Market Place serves as a tool for finding the best possible sparring partners as well as a forum for networking, sharing experiences, information and best practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project consortium consists of eight European higher education institutions: Reykjavik University, Iceland; Turku University of Applied Sciences, Finland ; Aarhus University, Denmark; Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, Finland; Ume\u00e5 University, Sweden; Telecom Bretagne, France; Aston University, United Kingdom and Queens University Belfast, United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project implementation is based on the circular model of quality assurance. The first phase of the project focuses on the self-evaluation and how to ensure the results from different self-evaluation methods provide the right kind of information to enable the best possible pairs for the cross-sparring. Pilot HEIs are supported in this by kick-off workshops. During the second phase, this information is entered to a virtual platform built in this project, the Market Place, where the actual pairing is conducted. Later also the results from the cross-sparrings are entered to the Market Place. Thus the most common development themes can be identified to arrange special theme workshops open for all interested. The Market Place also serves as a database for QA methods, best practices etc. The third phase is about the defining, piloting and refining the cross-sparring method. The continuity of the quality enhancement process after the cross-sparring is supported by collaborative workshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project derives from the experiences and actual needs distinguished in the participating institutions to develop the quality assurance process. As a result the degree programs, which are selected for piloting the self-evaluation and cross-sparring processes, are able to exploit the project results directly during the project in their quality assurance and development processes.

The economic sectors most represented within the province are agriculture, construction and services. The industry is centered mostly in the forest wealth of the province (wood and resin). In addition, Cuenca has 1 Business Park and 3 Industrial Estates.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the City Council decided to promote this initiative is due to the worrying situation which the city finds itself in, due to unemployment which is currently made more urgent due the economic crisis which we are experiencing. Cuenca is facing a stage in which the migration rate has reached 28.8% since the crisis began. This has meant that the town council of Cuenca is ready to do everything in its power to help alleviate the discontented situation which the city is experiencing. One of these initiatives is through the CUENCA PLUS project, which supports the economic and social development of the municipality through quality education and training.\r\n\r\nAccording to studies conducted by their own City Council, the causes of unemployment and the subsequent migration of young people from the town are due to many factors including: the failure of the education system with a high dropout rate, inadequate employment policies, the existing widespread discontent in the town and the lack of expertise of young people. That is why the City Council has decided to give a boost to the educational system of the municipality, by reinforcing and supplementing it with periods of practical training in companies in other EU countries, which mean further improvement upon the current intermediate level training and training employment.\r\n\r\nThe town council of Cuenca has suggested to 3 local institutions the creation of a Consortium formed by the City Council of Cuenca, IES Pedro Mercedes, IES San Jos\u00e9 and CEOE CEPYME Cuenca to assist in the development of the CUENCA PLUS project.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at 25 young people at intermediate level who are pursuing their final year or who are undertaking a course of preparation for employment leading to a Certificate of Competence.

Its four research clusters focus on tensions between narrow economic perspectives on integration and the lives of Europe\u2019s people in their diversity, between the EU\u2019s external (trade) policy and its constitutional values, between different degrees of intensity of integration and different levels of governance, and between the two competing European human rights regimes.

Instead, European integration need not be mired by tensions if its main actors maintain a sense of its purpose.

This objective will be attained through the ability for participants to participate on OLS platform to improve their language skills, in pre-departure phase.-Improve the quality of training and updating of teachers in order to improve the services and quality standards, thanks to their participation in the international experience as accompanying persons.-Improve and enhance the actions of vocational guidance for students, through synergies with external resources as well as services to local jobs. This aim will be achieved thanks to the work of preparation before departure, evaluation and certification of claims upon return.The GAP Month project envisages, in line with what was planned in the VET card request, and in line with the experiences of managing international mobility projects from 1996 to 2014, to allow 20 students in classes IV and V to 35 days international internship experience (+ 2 travel days) in Spain and in Northern Ireland.As a new element, in line with the provisions of the internationalization plan (page 7), the promoter aims to expand the opportunities of an international mobility experience to all students of the pole itself, involving all professionals profiles. In 2015, during the preparation phase of such a project proposal, the team in charge of the \"internationalisation paths\" have organised training courses for teachers on the internationalisation of the training offers, to make them aware of the importance of international internships.Students from logistics, captains and machinists sector, from mechanical, electronic and electro technical sector and even those from construction sector and surveyors will benefit from the project.Hosting companies have already mentioned possible areas of performances and LO for all target groups (see point C).The main actions of the project will be in line with the project management rules, already tested in the past by the Nautical Institute:-signature of the MOU with the host institutions for different professionals (captains and machinists, mechanics, electrical and electronic technicians, surveyors)-information and selection of candidates through analysis of European CV, cover letter and interview.

In this project, we will address these burning issues related to the fear surrounding foreigners. We will investigate what it actually is that people are afraid of and why. We will approach the topic by focusing on four major aspects: 1. Xenophobia: How do migrants and their hosts get along? We will look at history and share experiences about immigration and emigration. Participants will report on the situation in their home countries. Migrants will share their biographies with us. 2. Islamophobia: What\u2019s religion got to do with it? We will speak with Muslim groups and ask about their understanding of politics and society. An anti-bias training will help us overcome our own prejudices and provide us with tools to train others. 3. Integration: How do we make it work?

Our services are low threshold and some have been the first of their kind.  \r\n\r\nWithin the values of the work of Depaul Ireland lies a holistic approach to each individual with whom we work. This involves providing emotional support in addition to physical and practical services. It is within this structure of support that the work of our volunteer programme is vital. In particular, some of the Erasmus + priorities cover themes and issues that our volunteers and service users have been involved in.  For example, promoting awareness of homelessness issues to the public, developing healthier lifestyle activities within our projects, encouraging service users to develop skills and knowledge for future employment and study and exploring and celebrating culture through art, food and dialogue. \r\n\r\nObjectives of your project:\r\nThe volunteer programme was established to enable both local individuals and young people from other countries via Erasmus + to become involved with the work of the organisation.

We have detected the necessity to raise awareness on the protection and respect of the environment in the local community and young people. The main objective is to promote environmental awareness at an early age, show the students which actions they can take to protect the natural environment and promote the importance of biodiversity.  Also, to give the opportunity to the youngsters to meet their natural environment and give value to the fact that living in a rural area is not a disadvantage but can offer an excellent life quality. The project will offer skills and experiences to the EVS volunteers and youngsters of the community in order to increase their employability opportunities. Following the target residential area, the project will be hosted in the village Ayia Varvara, in Nicosia district. The project's duration is ten (10) months and it starts on the 1st of September 2017 and finishes on the 30th of June 2018.\r\n\r\nThe four (4) participants will have to express interest in culture and environment. They will have to be passionate and show initiative in organizing their own events and workshops. They will have to be creative in order to develop their own ideas and willing to offer their assistance at local events. There will be a range of interests they could get involved in culture, environmental issues, information technology skills, project planning and implementation. The main activities of the volunteers will involve school visits once per week on environmental education,  preparation of the school visits' activities, which mainly involve non-formal education, and initiatives on other activities, events or workshops according to the volunteers\u2019 interest.  Also, the volunteers will take part in the raise awareness campaign for a protected area near the Agia Varvara, by assisting on preparing informative and promotional material, studying the area and organizing outdoors activities in the area. The base of the project will be in Ayia Varvara but through the activities the volunteers will have the opportunity to visit the surrounding area.

The roots of the project are in the capitalization of previous EVS experiences, which made us reflect about the importance of creativity, music and art for the volunteers as a way to communicate with people. We linked this with our local context in Sandrigo, where there are limited opportunities for youth to express creatively, feeling at the same time protagonists of useful and active social activities. Moreover, the potential of music as a viable tool to communicate with others, promote positive values and beliefs, and enter in contact with disadvantaged and disabled people is not fully exploited.\r\nFor this reason, we decided to realize in Sandrigo, where Margherita operates, a project that has the objective to equip 3 young volunteers from France, Germany and United Kingdom with the set of competences, skills and methodologies that will allow them to promote common values of tolerance, social inclusion, respect of human rights, diversity, intercultural dialogue and solidarity using their creativity and sense of initiative. The target group will be composed by end-users of the Cooperative\u2019s services (disabled people, elderly, disadvantage children and youth), the local stakeholders and the community members. At the same time, the project will be an important non-formal learning opportunity for them to improve key skills and competences linked with social and cultural work fields.\r\nThe group of three volunteers aged 17-30 will start their activities in September 2018 for 12 months. From one side they will be involved in the activities realized in the various centres in favour of disadvantaged children and youth (including second generation migrants), disabled and elderly people. They will participate in the management of laboratories, workshops, intercultural and learning activities; sharing also simple moments (lunch, free time, etc.) and creating valuable relations. From the other side they will participate in the cultural activities open to the public realized during the festival \u201cMargherita in Festa\u201d, at the Cooperative\u2019s social caf\u00e9 and within the services for disabled people. All the activities will promote the involvement of local stakeholders as schools, associations and informal groups with which the Cooperative collaborates. As it can be noted, from one side, activities will be aimed to develop volunteers\u2019 competences and skills. In fact, to relate with disadvantaged people is a great way to understand better the true meaning of values as tolerance, diversity and solidarity, while acquiring communication skills and new relational methodologies. From the other side, the activities will focus on allowing volunteers to promote these values with the local community and peers through events, laboratories, etc. In all this process, music will be used as a viable tool to express oneself, communicate and promote/transfer values and beliefs.\r\nDuring activities, the tutors will guide/support volunteers transferring them competences, methodologies and values. Margherita\u2019s principle of \u201cDomiciliarity\u201d (home-care), which means to recognize and try to empower the whole context where people live in, will be used as a reference. Ideas and proposals of volunteers will be encouraged to stimulate their own sense of initiative and entrepreneurial attitude, and they will have the opportunity to create events, laboratories and workshops, involving local citizens and youth further than centres users.\r\nPositive impacts foreseen are many. The volunteers will have a big chance to acquire new skills and competencies, to increase their sense of tolerance and solidarity, as well as their intercultural competences and the ability to transfer these values to others. The users of Margherita\u2019s centres will have the possibility to create new relationships, exchanging new intercultural elements and reinforcing their communication attitudes, feeling part of an inclusive society. On the other hand, Margherita, and other partners, will enhance the international and European dimension of their work sharing this with the members of their communities. Volunteers will be considered as innovators. Their participation and creativity will help to improve the way we work every day. Different languages, cultures and background will be mixed together and allow a mutual positive contamination between all the parties involved, promoting common European Values of diversity, tolerance, solidarity and active participation, stimulating a dialogue between the involved local communities and Europe.\r\nFinally, our biggest hope is that, with the collaboration and the precious help of the volunteers, their creativity will contaminate all the people involved in the project and will allow to discover new paths of innovation contributing to build a real inclusive, tolerant and solidarity-based society.", "http://www.toolsforsolidarity.com", null, "erasmus_2017-3-IT03-KA105-012755_3"], [2014, "Practical Aid for Practical People", "Tools For Solidarity", 22954.0, 4, 4, "Tools for Solidarity has 3 main activities, they are: \r\n\r\n1.

It will be a question of promoting mixity and valuing the commitment of the young volunteers as well as the resources and the capacities of the people with special needs to participate actively in projects.\r\n\r\nIn order to disseminate the results of the exchange, a video will redraw the highlights of the week. It will be a way to make track for the participants and to report to their peers what they made. It will be also more widely broadcasted, towards other associations and  within our network of the International Arche in order to impulse a dynamics to make alive our international links.", "http://www.larchebelfast.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-2-FR02-KA105-010152_1"]]}}}}
