This project is designed to place ICT and specifically Geo-media at the heart of the project. An overarching objective is to develop a framework to enable collaborative studies of environmental issues with outputs fully embedded in the digital age. Atlantic salmon are found throughout the bio-region of the North Atlantic. They inhabit the rivers and seas of a significant number of European countries within their range. As they are a migratory species, they therefore face an array of environmental pressures. The studying of Atlantic salmon acts as a catalyst to investigate these numerous environmental problems in the fields of sustainable food production, ecotourism, renewable energy, pollution, agricultural impact, forestry, ecosystem management, fishery management, conservation methods and most notably climate change. Each partner country within the project presents a different perspective to study these issues. This opportunity has enabled the development of  4 distinct themes; (a)The value of Atlantic salmon.(b)A comparison between Baltic and Atlantic salmon.(c)The southern range of the Atlantic Salmon.(d) Industry and Atlantic Salmon. The project will provide 78 students aged 16 to 18 years, from the UK, Finland, France, Germany and Greenland an opportunity to participate. The students are from a range of socio-economic backgrounds. A variety of methods will be used to deliver the project aims. These will include field trips, collection of environmental data, workshops and seminars all of which are underpinned by an inquiry-based learning approach. The project outputs by the students will be collaborative in nature and consist of video presentations incorporated into Geo-media applications. The methodology used, will foster relationships between schools and established conservation communities. The project will make full use of social media as a means of dissemination and also to promote future engagement by schools not involved in this project. This will be done be enabling contributions by other schools to the Geo-media outputs as well as inclusion in the ongoing eTwinning project. Such an approach ensures a sustainable legacy of the project results.This project provides an opportunity to engage young people in science and environmental learning in an innovative way. It also provides a route to increasing skills for life and skills for life long learning.

She has been teaching beginners classes in Spanish for a number of years. In order to improve her competence in this second language, as well as her knowledge of Hispanic culture, she is currently undertaking a self-funded Certificate of Continued Education course in Spanish at Strathclyde University. This is a two year course which Lisa will complete in May 2017. The participant wishes to participate in a three week language immersion course in Spain run by LFEE in July 2017. The course will provide further training in the target language, as well as language teaching methodology. On a local level, the course will help improve the participant's competence in Spanish language and knowledge of Spanish culture. It will enhance her teaching practice and, in turn, help improve the learning and teaching of the language at her school as it will allow her to gain and share with colleagues new ideas for activities and new resources, including ideas for incorporating ICT in the classroom. Completion of this course will also provide the beneficiary with the required period of 'residency' which will allow her to fully register Spanish as an additional teaching subject with the General Teaching Council of Scotland. This will mean she will be permitted to teach the language at National Certificate Level. The main second foreign language (L3) at Perth High School is Spanish.  It is hoped that the impact of the new curriculum will encourage more students to continue studying at least one foreign language beyond Secondary 3, and also increase the number of those opting to study 2 languages other than English. For this reason, it is desirable that the participant is fully qualified to teach Spanish in addition to French, in order to ensure progression for students in the language beyond a basic level. \r\nA wider impact for cluster schools is that the teacher plans to assist in training primary teaching colleagues at up to 8 feeder schools in basic level Spanish so that they in turn can include some Spanish as part of the 1+2 curriculum (L3).

Full-electric battery-based busses will be demonstrated in five locations (Barcelona, Bonn, Muenster, Plzen and Rome), whereas plug-in hybrid or range-extender type of power-trains will be demonstrated in three sites (London, Glasgow and Stockholm).\n\nThe lifetime of project ZeEUS is long enough to collect sufficient amount of statistically valid data and make comprehensive analysis to deliver meaningful \u201clessons learned\u201d, guidelines and provide feedback to the R&D activity of manufacturers and suppliers to make technology mature for wide commercialisation.", null, 17587514.0, 11, 40, "ZEEUS", null, "http://www.scottish-southern.co.uk", null, "fp7_186997_996513496"], [1359676800000, 1461974400000, "Distributed Intelligence for Cost-Effective and Reliable Distribution Network Operation", "Scottish and Southern Energy Plc", "As the patterns of power generation and distribution are rapidly changing in Europe towards a highly dispersed and volatile system, Distribution System Operators need to completely change traditional ways of grid operations.

One of our educational focuses lies on teaching modern languages. For years, we have been networking with other European schools organising a high number of well-established student exchanges, hosting exchange students or sending our students abroad individually and within the framework of study trips to various European countries. In order to establish these relations even more and in order to prepare our students for a working life that is based more and more on international relations, we would very much like to participate in the programme of Learning Mobility of Individuals. \r\nIt is our aim to enable teachers of various subjects and with varying professional experience to participate in this programme in order to get the highest outcome. Consequently, our teachers serve as examples for our students by establishing and maintaining international relations. Thus, we set an example of European interaction to our students.\r\nIt is important for us to boost general education, skills and employability. Additionally we place great importance on mobility, an essential  quality in the context of our students' future, which might involve \"Youth on the move\". We want to raise their awareness for multilingualism, life-long learning as well as social cohesion and solidarity in a modern Europe fit for the future.\r\n\r\nThe participating teachers and social education workers are looking forward to getting to know not only other European educational systems practically and first-hand, but also other methods of structuring educational processes. Moreover, they want to seize the opportunity to undertake various advanced vocational trainings on teaching and educating students as well as vocational trainings on cultural awareness and language skills. Studying abroad offers the possibility to expand our language teachers\u2019 knowledge. Furthermore, it is the best way to get into touch with native speakers to establish and maintain bilateral relations. Our social education workers regard an educational training abroad as a valuable means to develop their professional and personal skills. Thus, they can contribute substantially to our school culture. Based on Europe 2020 we selected our activities abroad, which comprise job shadowing, educational training and language courses. All the activities enhance key competences, transnational learning and mobility of all the participants. Thus the participating teachers can convincingly and authentically enable our students to enter the job market or continue their further education and meet the challenges of the future. \r\nAll in all, the programme Learning Mobility of Individuals offers the possibility to enhance the quality of our education \u2013 be it social or professional education. Additionally, it is a great opportunity to get an insight into other methods of teaching, to establish and improve our cultural awareness and to gain experience in the field of applying modern technologies profitably in the classroom.

Students with experience abroad also set a good example for other (future) students. With their newly acquired experience and knowledge they will have a positive influence on their peers.   Because our employees maintain contacts with international educators, trade organizations and partner schools abroad, the quality of education is enriched with new educational ideas, curriculum possibilities, organizational structures and a broader outlook on education and fields of expertise in Europe.   The impact of an experience abroad on students, employees and the organization is invaluable.

In the Netherlands, with its small, open economy, there is a need for more information about various European countries and our position in relation to these countries. Schools and students are encouraged to have international experiences. In this context, Nimeto Utrecht made internationalization one of the spearheads of its Focus on Skill as described in the quality control plan 2015-2020 which is incorporated in Nimeto Utrecht\u2019s strategic course. Nimeto Utrecht believes it is important that students are given an opportunity to gain experience abroad. Although internationalization is already embedded in the organization, there is still room for improvement. Nimeto Utrecht is searching for more anchors abroad to connect with. This concerns internships for individual students, as well as collaboration projects or exchange programs with partner schools abroad. The project Internship abroad 1 caters to both students and employees who wish to do an internship abroad for a certain period of time. With Erasmus+ funding, more students and employees will become eligible for internship experiences in Europe, regardless of their financial situations. \r\n\r\nThe project Internship abroad 1 involves 14 students doing a  5-month professional internship at a company in Europe.\r\nThis means that the number of students participating in an internship abroad would double compared to last year. The project also offers 1 employee a chance to gain experience and knowledge at an educational institution in Europe over a period of two weeks or more. \r\nEspecially for the benefit of students and employees participating in European internships, Nimeto Utrecht created an assignment for one employee to coordinate all activities involved in the project Internship abroad 1 and work closely with the department for business contacts and the business coordinators responsible for the internships. \r\n\r\nBy participating in education and/or doing an internship abroad, students and employees of Nimeto Utrecht will become familiar with different cultures, have new experiences and broaden their horizons.

To date, however hydrogen bus demonstrations have been focussed on urban buses only, leaving other public transit applications completely unaddressed. In addition, only a limited number of European regions have had the chance to trial hydrogen bus technology, which means the technology is relatively unknown to the majority of European bus operators.\nHyTransit will trial a fleet of six hybrid fuel cell buses in daily fleet services, together with one state of the art hydrogen refuelling station in Aberdeen (Scotland) for over three years. This project is designed to contribute to the commercialisation of hydrogen buses in Europe by:\n\u2022\tBringing together an industrial consortium from across Europe to deliver the project, including buses from Van Hool (Belgium) and state of the art refuelling technology from BOC (UK).\n\u2022\tDevelop six A330 hybrid fuel cell buses specifically modified for long sub-urban routes.\n\u2022\tGenerating new Intellectual Property for Europe by developing the concept design for the world\u2019s first hybrid fuel cell coach for long-route transit applications.\n\u2022\tExposing the six buses to real world operation with exactly the same service requirements as diesel buses, with 14 hours and 270km per day operation.\n\u2022\tA state of the art hydrogen refuelling station will be constructed to serve the bus fleet. The station will be based on ionic compressors, configured to allow a refuelling speed of up to 120 grams per second. The station will house an electrolyser system for on-site hydrogen production.\n\u2022\tTaking the first step for a large-scale rollout of hydrogen buses in Scotland. The next logical step after this project is Scottish Government support for the deployment of a minimum of 50 buses. This project will be the first step to realising this vision for Scotland.\nThe overall project objective is to prove that a hybrid fuel cell bus is capable of meeting the operational performance of an equivalent diesel bus on demanding UK routes (including urban and inter-urban driving), whilst considerably exceeding its environmental performance.\nThis will be achieved by bringing together a primarily industrial consortium from five member states to develop, deploy and then monitor the buses in day to day service, with an overarching aim to demonstrate an operational availability for the buses equivalent to diesel (over 90%).\nThe project will also address the main commercial barrier to the technology (namely bus capital cost) by deploying state of the art components, which will reduce the unit cost of the bus to below 1.1 million euros for the first time.\nResults of the project will be widely disseminated to the general public.

The project will develop an intelligent image acquisition and analysis system to enable more comprehensive and objective inspection of the track without the need for the  increasingly unsafe and subjective track walking inspection. The project will also develop track sub-components with self monitoring capabilities to promote timely and knowledge based intervention for maintenance and renewal, while giving greater visibility of residual life and the need for future investments. These innovative developments are directed towards increasing the effective availability of the track infrastructure, increasing the life of new or renovated asset, reducing the cost of maintenance by timely intervention based on objective measurement of degradation and thereby provide a high quality reliable service to the end user.\nThe project has two key drivers; firstly to contribute towards the realisation of a 24 x 7 railway by minimising the disruption caused by activities such as inspection, remedial and reactive maintenance, and track renewal. Secondly, the introduction of novel sensor and inspection technologies that focuses more on the monitoring of degradation through the measurement of deviation from identified benchmark data known as a \u201csignature tune\u201d.
