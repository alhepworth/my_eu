But it has a problem: Most EU citizens don\u2019t care about some Brussels agency they never heard of. The solution is in the ERC\u2019s mandate: frontier research. It has science \u2013 the cutting edge variety, that can capture the imagination, change the world and stimulate curiosity. We have seen the power of a fundamental science story elsewhere, and how it can focus attention on the institution behind it: the Higgs boson and CERN.  It takes high scientific achievement, great story-telling, a tight focus, creative communications and a sustained effort to build a mass following in science. We believe the ERC can achieve this \u2013 to matter as the source of cool science, to students, investors, policy makers, researchers, and all citizens generally, in all 28 EU member-states and beyond. The ERC can invent science and mirror it back to society. In short, ERC = ScienceSquared.\n\nTo convey this message, the ERC = ScienceSquared campaign will promote ERC projects and grantees through a cluster of innovative, popular and high quality content packages \u2013 punchy videos, long-form \u2018snowfall\u2019 articles, tiny Tweets, augmented reality, \u2018pop-up\u2019  displays \u2013 which will be adapted to a new research theme every six months. The content packages will be used in ten science museums, 34 universities, hundreds of online media channels and many other outlets covering 37 countries. These will be sustainable communication channels, which the ERC can continue using when the contract is over, targeting key audience segments: more than 40 million people. This campaign \u2013 as \u2018cool\u2019 as the ERC itself - will stir interest in science, raise awareness of the ERC as a science power, build broader political and societal support for the ERC \u2013 and encourage grant applications from a new generation of researchers, especially in countries under-represented among ERC grantees.", 417031.0, 810141.0, 6, 8, "ScienceSquared", null, null, null, "h2020_198734_996745520"], [1451606400000, 1609372800000, "Deusto International Research School", "Science Business Publishing Limited", "With a proven track in PhD training (more than 1000 PhD in 50 years, 58 in 2013) the Deusto International Research School (DIRS) aims at attracting qualified international Early Stage Researchers for high quality PhD training that enhance research, complementary and transferable skills.\nDIRS aims are grounded in a solid structure generated around a robust and dynamic ecosystem that encourages and enables cooperation, co-creation and collegiality among 7 doctoral programmes and 24 research groups around four research foci centred on challenges identified in the EU and the Basque Smart Specialisation Strategies: i) Health and Wellbeing, ii) Human Rights, Peace and Conflict Resolution, iii) Sustainable Development and Innovation and iv) Lifelong Learning. \nUDEUSTO has actively and creatively procured conditions conducive to frequent dialogues between economic, cultural and social actors whose cooperation and exchanges help realise DIRS aims.

Patient reported outcomes will be agreed and used in the assessment and development of the system which also aims to increase adherence and enable frailty to be reported using mHealth technology.
