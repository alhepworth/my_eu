Our concept involves the development of a low cost, retro-fittable to 90% of domestic dwellings, water recycling system that is capable of the re-use of showering and bathing water thereby saving up to 50% of personal washing water usage and >50% of the associated heating energy usage AND that is capable of re-using filtered grey water from bathing/showering for toilet flushing thereby saving up to 35% of overall household water usage\u2019.
