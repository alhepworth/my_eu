Acoording to the analysis we did, we found out that unenthusiasm for school and irresponsible behaviors of the students, lack of basic skills and early school leaving are common problems of European society. As it is focused on the strategies of Prakash Nair, the simple fact that the old mass-production model of education simply doesn\u2019t work for most of students. The old model was designed to weed out the \u201csmart\u201d students for college from those who would work in nonacademic vocations. But that kind of distinction is no longer valid. Today, it is important to take in consideration students\u2019 needs, wishes and skills while planning their education and career. Schools need to do more than just select students according to their cognitive abilities. \r\nWe are 5 partners from different 5 countries and we created this project in a complete aggreement of all partners in needs, rationale, objects, tasks and share of tasks, meeting programme, Learning/Teaching/Training activities for pupils. We will work on the definite innovative strategies to provide the knowledge and skills that students will need to succeed in a new global economy than the traditional model still practiced in most schools. We will study on the six strategies. Those are; \r\n1-Personalization, \r\n2-Multi-Age Classes,\r\n3-Small Learning Communities,\r\n4-Cooperative Learning,\r\n5-Project Based Learning,\r\nEvery partner institution will have one of those to study by a team involving from teachers, students, administrative staff and PTA, for developing methedology, applying into school curriculum, doing practical applications in the schools, observing and evaluating the results and reporting the benefits. At the end of two years these 5 innovative strategies will have been practised and the reports will be collected in a book.That book will be the outcomes of the project as intellectual output. While doing these work, we aimed to develop the schools as the places where diverse talents are recognized and nurtured where every student is made to feel special, has an opportunity to realize his or her full potential and succeed on his or her own terms - in other words, they need to become \"New Paradigm\" schools.\r\nThe central objectives of our project are defined as;\r\n-to increase enthusiasm for school and responsible behaviors,\r\n-to overcome lack of basic skills \r\n-to prevent early school leaving  \r\n-to integrate good practices and new methods into daily activities; \r\n-to improve provision and assessment of basic and transversal skills, entrepreneurship, language competences and digital skills;\r\n-to improve levels of skills for employability\r\n-to increase motivation and satisfaction for future\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF THE PARTICIPANTS\r\nStudents/teenagers: There will be teams of 30 students in each partner organisation so 150 in total will take part actively in project activities. Approximately 1200 students/teenagers will indirectly be affected. \r\nTeachers/Adults: There will be teams of 5 teachers in each partner organisation so 30 in total will take actively in project activities. There will be a teacher of English,Music,,a Physicological Counselor, an ICT teacher and a PE teacher/trainer .Approximately 150 teachers/adults will indirectly be affected.\r\nAdministrative staff: The headteacher/chairman and a deputy head will take part in the project, Approximately 36 administrative staff will indirectly be affected.\r\nFamilies: The number of the famiy members will be 300 in total and they will contribute to introduce the host country\u2019s culture, tradition and to prepare traditional food for international evening. Approximately 480 family members will indirectly be affected.\r\nLocal community: Local community like local press, municipality, directorate of national education and PTA will help to disseminate the project to a wider community. Approximately 800 people from local community will indirectly be affected.\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACTS\r\nThrough our project the six partners intend to create both short-term and long-term tangible and intangible results and to achieve the biggest possible impact to future projects and policy processes such as leading students to overcome lack of self-esteem, setting up the project website in order to provide continuous access to the general information of the project activities, progress and results, writing newspaper reports and creating on-site panels or leaflets to inform non-specialist audience about the project\u2019s background and main results, arranging a multiplier event, communication, and cognitive skills  of at risk students, cultivating effective partnerships between trainers, educators, and community organizations so as to amplify our collective impact on the students.", "http://www.oakfield-dartford.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-TR01-KA219-022742_2"]]}}, "4SB": {"cordis": {"data": [[1377993600000, 1504137600000, "Fixed Point Open Ocean Observatories Network", "Texcel Technology Plc", "The Fixed point Open Ocean Observatory network (FixO3) seeks to integrate European open ocean fixed point observatories and to improve access to these key installations for the broader community. These will provide multidisciplinary observations in all parts of the oceans from the air-sea interface to the deep seafloor. Coordinated by the National Oceanography Centre, UK, FixO3 will build on the significant advances achieved through the FP7 programmes EuroSITES, ESONET and CARBOOCEAN. With a budget of 7.00 Million Euros over 4 years (starting September 2013) the proposal has 29 partners drawn from academia, research institutions and SME\u2019s. In addition 14 international experts from a wide range of disciplines comprise an Advisory Board.\nThe programme will be achieved through:\n1.\tCoordination activities to integrate and harmonise the current procedures and processes. Strong links will be fostered with the wider community across academia, industry, policy and the general public through outreach, knowledge exchange and training.\n2.\tSupport actions to offer a) access to observatory infrastructures to those who do not have such access, and b) free and open data services and products.\n3.\tJoint research activities to innovate and enhance the current capability for multidisciplinary in situ ocean observation.\nOpen ocean observation is currently a high priority for European marine and maritime activities. FixO3 will provide important data on environmental products and services to address the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and in support of the EU Integrated Maritime Policy. The FixO3 network will provide free and open access to in situ fixed point data of the highest quality. It will provide a strong integrated framework of open ocean facilities in the Atlantic from the Arctic to the Antarctic and throughout the Mediterranean, enabling an integrated, regional and multidisciplinary approach to understand natural and anthropogenic change in the ocean.", 11242.0, 6892695.0, 12, 29, "FIXO3", null, null, null, "fp7_110489_958796404"]]}}}}
