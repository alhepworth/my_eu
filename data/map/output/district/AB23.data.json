Limited", "There is a distinct need for an improved method for accurate and inexpensive deployment and retrieval of seabed sensors and equipment. The AutoDrop will be hydro dynamically designed in order to glide through the water experiencing a minimum of drag. The rudders will maintain stability and change the direction if desired. It is important that the time used by the AutoDrop to travel from the surface to the seabed is kept at a minimum to maximize accuracy. A short time descending requires a heavy weight load attached to the unit, while releasing the weight load should lead to high degree of buoyancy to enable rapid ascent. Manner of operation: Prior to deployment operation, the units are programmed with a destination on the seabed and a location on the surface. The unit uses the surface location as a reference in order to navigate to the target area. As the unit is dropped into the water, it gains momentum until terminal velocity is reached. The navigation system calculates the position of the unit relative to the target and, if necessary, adjusts the rudders to change direction. A gentle landing further increases the chances of a successful deployment. The sensors transported down to the seabed by the AutoDrop units perform their task over a defined time period. When it is time to ascend, either dictated by a programmed time limit or by a broadcasted signal from top side, the AutoDrop units release their weight load or in other ways change their buoyancy. The buoyancy causes the units to ascend towards the surface. The navigation system will be applied on the way up and may be programmed to form clusters on the surface, thus simplifying the retrieval process. Clusters are easy to form by sending a number of units to the same surface location. At surface the AutoDrop units will have the possibility to radio its GPS coordinates to a service vessel.", 4057.0, 1256011.0, 6, 11, "AUTODROP", null, "http://www.cdltd.net", "/docs/results/images/2014/147527.jpg", "fp7_97327_984678429"]]}}, "8GW": {"cordis": {"data": [[1354320000000, 1443571200000, "WETMATE \u2013 a 33kV Subsea Wet-Mateable\nConnector for Offshore Renewable Energy", "Hydro Bond Engineering Limited", "Most European offshore wind farms are currently installed within 20 km of the coast in shallow water depths up to 20m. The next generation will be developed at distances of 40 km in sea depths up to 80m. These new locations present technical challenges for engineering and the possibility of new synergies between all marine renewable energy resources including wave, tide and wind. Inspection and maintenance at depth is difficult and the raising of transmission voltages to keep cable sizes manageable is urgently required as the technical difficulty of hauling heavy cables is significantly increased. The availability of self-monitoring connectors to eliminate routine maintenance at greater depths is seen as a potential step-change improvement in infrastructure management and the development of ROV-installable wet-mate connectors as an alternative to dry-mated cable is a dominant industry objective. We will deliver a prototype 33kV hybrid wet-mate connector with a connectivity monitoring system and future-proof features for higher voltage connector technologies. This will lead to efficient power transmission, reduced installation and maintenance costs and  precision remote monitoring that reduces routine maintenance and intervention by divers, benefitting health, safety and affordability.", 446226.0, 1283660.0, 6, 9, "WETMATE", "http://www.wetmate.eu/", "http://www.HydroGroup.plc.uk", null, "fp7_106010_953174866"], [1427846400000, 1553990400000, "Sensors for LArge scale HydrodynaMic Imaging of ocean floor", "Hydro Bond Engineering Limited", "LAkHsMI will develop a new bio-inspired technology to make continuous and cost-effective measurements of the near-field, large-scale hydrodynamic situation, for environmental monitoring in cabled ocean observatories, marine renewable energy and port/harbor security.
