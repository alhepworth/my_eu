We believe that sustainable multidisciplinary clusters and their orientation towards ecological transition, are one important approach for a responsible answer to the present needs of our society. In our experience, they are innovation labs, incubators of new ways of working, living and acting for the co-creation of sustainable communities. Therefore, the main aim of this project is to work in partnership for development and implementation of innovative practices in the field of creation and management of sustainable multidisciplinary clusters. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPartners are 4 organisations that manage innovative clusters  \u2013 Association Les Darwiniens for Darwin Eco-system (Bordeaux, France), hACERIA Ateak for ZAWP (Bilbao, Spain), LX Factory for LX Factory (Lisbon, Portugal), Rojc Alliance for Social Centre Rojc (Pula, Croatia) The London Borough of Lewisham and Capture Art and Creative projects Ltd. 2 partners that represent cooperation  between local stakeholders and enterprises willing to develop similar cluster in London, based on knowledge and experience gained during partnership \r\n\r\nAt the present time all of the clusters operate in isolation from each other, so this projects core objective is to bring all of their knowledge, skills and experience together in an innovative way, fostering a concrete network between them and enabling all of this information to be freely shared with others.\r\n\r\nDuring the project period  different  co-creation methods and approaches will be made to present innovative models in the following 4 project scopes: 1.ecological know-how, 2.participatory governance, 3.co-working, 4.social entrepreneurship skills. Concrete results of the project are the intellectual outputs: Applied research and Online Educational Toolbox - 'hands on' tool based on tried and tested methods and experience that can be used by the public who want to create similar clusters or improve work of present one. For the creation of both intellectual outputs, we will use a collaborative framework for the gathering of information and as a continuous process we will include peer to peer learning. For the creation of our applied research we will combine both academics and creative professionals to work together in an international team, this will create the base for a different more innovative dynamic within the research team. During the creation of the toolbox we will use learner generated approach to its content with internal testing (alpha testing) by a small team of individuals from the partnership to measure and test the content (build, measure, learn or build measure, change) and external testing (beta testing) with new learners from outside of the clusters. The toolbox will utilise as many new digital methods and open source resources as possible. Both our intellectual outputs can be built upon and added to after the projects conclusion (our innovative intellectual outputs will be open source).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 3 main target groups for our project: a) internal users, members from the partner organisations, b) external users, persons or organisations that need know how, with the primary aim of creating a cluster or participating in an existing one, c) local stakeholders who are the most capable of driving this kind of initiative into existence and need research and a broader inside view for the actions they want to support or develop.\r\n\r\nOur participants are staff members of partner organisations that will provide and participate in peer to peer learning with co-creation of intellectual outputs \u2013 participating in mobility and local activities leaded by Research and Toolbox teams. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent project activities will be used to reach final project results: six transnational meetings attended by 105 participants, 3 types of joint staff events that will be attended in total by 45 participants: 5 study visits that will support creation of Research, 5 bilateral & 1 multilateral training course and 5 assistantship periods with discussion workshops that will  support creation of Toolbox. Intellectual outputs will be created by 2 international teams: Research team with 11 members and Toolbox team with 21 members . For dissemination of project results we will organize 6 multiplier events: 5 local dissemination events - one in each country and one Final Conference, on which we expect minimum 290 attendants in total. \r\n\r\nWe expect that our project will bring together local actors within a common framework that will result in social cohesion, improving social entrepreneurship and gaining support from stakeholders, with an impact on local policy towards ecological transition.\r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits our project aims at creating are trainings based on concrete methods of working,  recognised through a certification process, approved by responsible national authorities.", "http://www.captureprojects.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA204-008725_2"]]}}, "1PS": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "School EU Professional Development Project SWY", "St William of York Catholic Primary School", 52502.0, 1, 1, "St William of York is a one form entry school, in Lewisham, South East London. The school has a wide range of languages, cultures & ethnicities. Most pupils are Roman Catholic. There is a strong and close connection with the Italian community and the school works in partnership with the Italian Consulate and adopted Italian as its focus language for the teaching of Modern Foreign Languages.\r\n\r\nItalian is taught from Y 1 to Yr 6 with the help of an Italian teacher. Class teachers, however,  lack confidence to use the language beyond the Italian lesson, and this has been identified as an area for development in the SDPlan. The school will arrange for staff to take part in an Italian Language Course, with Cactus Languages, which will develop skills, confidence of  and expertise of teachers so that they are able to use Italian across the curriculum. \r\nYear 1             6 Teachers      3 Teaching Assistants     1 Assistant HT            Headteacher                \r\nYear 2             6 Teachers      3 Teaching Assistants     1 Assistant HT            Headteacher           Total staff in Yr 1 & Yr 2 = 22 Teaching Staff\r\n\r\nWithin the planned activities, the HT & Asst HTs will take part in the learning programme in Yr 1 and Yr 2 to ensure that momentum, and commitment to the project back in the UK, evidenced in external reviews. Staff will enrol on an Italian Language course in order to develop the confidence to use Italian in their lessons and participate more fully in the lessons in school with the teacher from the Italian Consulate, on their return to school. Teachers and Teaching Assistants will lead CPD sessions each half term so that their learning and experiences are disseminated amongst all staff within the school community.  Teachers will  integrate Italian speaking into other curriculum subjects, as well as build stronger links with the local Italian community, our parents & their families. Increased  teacher confidence will create opportunities for spontaneous talk in the classroom in Italian. Teachers and pupils will participate in more authentic exchanges, eg. meeting and greeting phrases. Teachers will conduct classroom business using simple expressions in Italian. Pupils will begin to use Italian for real communicative ends and build their speaking confidence in the process. As the SDPlan identifies that this project would span a 2 year period, the impact will be evident as Italian becomes further embedded in the school curriculum, and the commitment to developing the expertise of staff and children in learning Modern Foreign Languages.\r\n\r\nCelebrating the diversity and richness of our families cultural heritage reflects the ethos of our school. Teachers and pupils will provide showcase lessons for parents and staff from other schools (one each term, inviting 12 teachers from each school ie. 24 teachers). \r\n\r\nIn addition, another key area identified on the SDPlan is the development of independence in learning and development of a Mastery approach, which will be reflected in teaching and learning across the curriculum. The school has previously had a lead teacher/Assistant HT who has made an exchange  visit to Shanghai, to learn about Maths Mastery. This has had a positive impact on our school and the delivery of the curriculum. We have benefited from the cultural exchange and know that we have much to learn from our colleagues in Europe too. With SERN in Bologna, we will access training on the Reggio Emilia early years approach in Italy.  \r\n\r\nYear 1: KS1 Asst HT, Early Years Leader & KS1 teacher = 3 staff will attend their course.   Year 2: KS2 Asst HT, HT and KS2 teacher = 3 staff. 6 staff in total. \r\n\r\nThe school will communicate its involvement in the programme & report on its positive impact in a range of ways. This would include:  HT Report to Governors, Newsletter to parents, Website, local press. The HT & the Asst HT will share the impact of this Professional Development with presentations at the Lewisham Leadership Forum for HTs (70 HTs). The staff will share their learning & the impact in school with parents with workshops and presentations. The leaders and teachers involved in learning from Reggio Emilia, will disseminate this learning, with 6 workshops each year for staff and teachers in Lewisham. We expect to reach 120 teachers. The impact of the project will be evaluated using baseline questionnaires, lesson observation records and pupil conferences. These will be repeated at the mid point and end of the project and reported to governors and the Erasmus+ project. Through this project, Italian language learning will be integrated into the school curriculum by 2020, and pupils' independence in learning will be evidenced in KS2 scores and external reviews eg.
