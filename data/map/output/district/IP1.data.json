The profile of participants vary by shipping company , but all participants will share in style active , healthy and sustainable living.\r\n\r\nA part of the training course, a person from the association Columbares will spend 15 days doing job shadowing in Suffolk Town Council (UK), to learn new practices for promoting the use of bicycles, improve her language skills and help the host entity organize a small event to disseminate the results of the project.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the training course include workshop on repairing and maintenance of bicycle, basic training for safe mobility, workshop on how to assess security and appropriability of roads for bikes, visits to organizations that are promoting social change, workshop on designing of bicycle tours, discussion of bicycle activism and participation in Critical Mass, experience of bike tourism in Murcia. The methodologies used include group work and discussions ( bicycle activism, creation of tours) and many activities based on the idea of \"learning by doing\" ( repariment and maintenance of bicycle, bike rides) and emotion-based learning (participation in Critical Mass and bike rides ) .\r\n\r\nJob shadowing activities include meetings, debates, discussion groups, workshops and visits to different institutions to learn about public health in Suffolk, initiatives to promote cycling and operation of the Most Active Country Advisory Group, the transport strategy in Suffolk, the activities of city development, road safety in the city and sport and health. Also during her stay in UK the worker will organize an event as a part of Sustainable Travel Forum in order to o publicize the project results. The methodology will consist of meetings with local authorities (different departments), participation in working groups, attending presentations and participation in the Sustainable Travel Forum while presenting project results.\r\n\r\nThe results and impact of the project include increased use of the bike in general, increased use of bicycles as a means of transport and not as a hobby, improved knowledge in the maintenance and repair of the bike, increasing the amount and quality of bike-related activities organized by the partners. We also hope that the participants complete the course will feel as more active citizens and will be more interested in entrepreneurship. Likewise, we expect to see improvement in the training of the Columbares worker taking part in the job shadowing, in areas related to sustainable mobility and promotion the bicycle, as well as in her language skills. These results will improve both, her employability and her organization.\r\n\r\nThe expected long-term impacts include strengthening cooperation between different types of organizations, countries and regions represented in the course.

Due to these facts there is a clear evidence of the need to analyze British and Lithuanian educational systems and help children who are forced to change schools and therefore they find difficulties in adjusting. Today as we are all in EU with no borders and migration is part of our daily lives, we are starting to face new problems. \r\nHaving spent 3-5 years learning at schools abroad Lithuanian children experience difficulties adapting back to their native school system. The school has to help them to cope with these problems, which are more complex by not knowing the background of their previous education.

Besides, it is the first time they got interested in Erasmus+ possibilities and as we are experienced, we will coordinate the project and help them. Sharing the experience they have working with emigrants, will help us to find the ways how to help such students. Now  the main attention is paid only to academic problems (adapted programs for Lithuanian language) but the students are facing problems occurring from different teaching/learning environment as well as personal adaptation ones. Trying to solve these issues, we and our UK partners are going to share British and Lithuanian schools best practices studying, analyzing and discussing educational systems, comparing the teaching/learning environments and curriculum, sharing teaching methods as well as the approach to emigrants\u2018 needs from Eastern Europe in the UK and re-emigrants' from UK in Lithuania.

A centre that integrates Nursery, Primary and Secondary Education. Located in D\u00e9nia, a city of commercial and cultural exchanges thanks to the sea and its port. This historical journey has left a multicultural mark that is currently reflected in our educational centre.\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE OUR AIMS?\r\nOur goal is to adapt to this multicultural reality and turn our school into a centre that offers prestige and high quality education. AIMS:\r\n1. Improve curricular competences in foreign languages. In the medium term, the centre aims to ensure that our students will be multilingual and have mastered the two co-official languages (Valencian and Spanish) and that we will include more English teaching sessions.\r\n2. Acquire new methods and didactic skills in the teaching of foreign languages as a vehicular language.\r\n3. Development of face-to-face or virtual activities with a European dimension.\r\n\r\nHOW WILL WE ACHIEVE OUR AIMS?\r\n- Structured courses for teaching staff in an English-speaking country for the improvement of linguistic competence in a foreign language (English). It is considered a necessary complement to the training courses we are already taking.\r\n- Structured courses on methodological innovations and techniques for introducing English as a vehicular language in non-linguistic subjects.\r\n- Exchange of good practices with a European centre (job-shadowing mobilities)\r\n\r\nWHAT IMPACT WILL WE CREATE?\r\nThe results will have an impact on the entire educational community and its surroundings:\r\n1. Impact on the participants and on the rest of the teaching staff. This increases the linguistic competences in foreign languages and their cultural immersion. It allows the reflection on other practices and the collaboration with other European professionals in a common project. It also intensifies the use of Google Drive, Skype, Facebook, Twitter and the eTwinning platform.\r\n2. Impact on the students: beneficiary of the teachers\u2019 learning. They will improve the linguistic competence in languages and connect the academic learning with daily life.\r\n3. Impact on the educational centre. It implies the introduction of the European dimension and enhances intercultural relations between centres. New methods and strategies will be included in the centre's official documents, PEC, PGA and anual report.\r\nDefinitive incorporation in our centre of The European Development Plan and its incorporation into the PGA. The Erasmus+ group will be maintained in order to continue improving the linguistic competence and promote a KA2.\r\n\r\nHOW WILL THE RESULTS OF THE PROJECT BE MADE PUBLIC?\r\nOur dissemination plan must provide information to all members about the QUALITY, RELEVANCE and EFFECTIVENESS of the RESULTS of this program.\r\nOur dissemination strategy will cover all sectors of the educational community and its local surroundings (students, teachers, parents, schoolcouncil and the town of D\u00e9nia). The formats and tools are multiple and varied from a simple bullet in board to social networks (radio, press, arranged conferences, leaflets, informative meetings, Youtube video, Facebook, Twitter and the school website).\r\n\r\nHOW WILL WE VALUE OUR PROJECT?\r\nThe programme will be evaluated in the short and mid-long term.\r\n+ In the short term, we will measure: achievement of the beneficiaries of learning, results achieved in relation to the planned aims of the centre, mobility management, impact on teaching methods, adaptation of the participants to the country and the degree of efficiency of the systems of communication established in the group.\r\n-A mid-long term: number of visits on the web in the Erasmus+ section, increase in the students\u2019 academic capacity in terms of language proficiency in foreign languages, number of teachers who continue to be trained in the linguistic and methodological area and increase in academic performance, number of references written or broadcasted in the local press and radio, number of projects related to the guest school, modifications of the programming with the contributions of what has been learnt in the mobility, number of requests from teachers to continue with this KA101 project and how many wish to get involved in a KA2.\r\nUsing all this data, an evaluation report of this first K1 experience will be made. After studying this, we will revise and improve the European Development Plan and we will work on a K2 and a second K1.", "http://www.westbourne.attrust.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA101-048796_1"]]}}}}
