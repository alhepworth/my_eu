And whilst previously uneconomical deep-water oilfields are now becoming financially viable, accessing them remains difficult due to the technical challenges associated with extreme operating conditions.\n\nWhen working in water at depths of up to 5000m the water pressure is above 500atm. Components and systems for extracting oil and gas need to be neutrally buoyant, in order to maintain them in the desired position. Buoyancy modules for drill risers used in exploration lines are currently made from syntactic foams using micro and macro-spheres. Macro-spheres offer buoyancy advantages, but become increasingly unreliable at greater depths due to manufacturing inconsistencies. A typical deep-water buoyancy module will contain thousands of tightly packed spheres, and when a buoyancy module fails this can necessitate costly repairs and lead to environmental harm\n\nThe current technology for buoyancy modules operating at less than 3km uses spheres made of Expanded PolyStyrene (EPS) balls which are then coated with a shell of epoxy resin. The epoxy coating acts as the load bearing structure withstanding water pressure. Spheres from each batch are pressure tested and rated for performance which determines the depth at which the batch can be used\n\nThis proposal concerns development of a perfectly spherical, low-cost coated ceramic macrosphere manufacturing process. The ceramic spheres will be designed and manufactured in more than one size for improved packing density and rated for higher compressive strength allowing use at greater depths. A further development of this project is to address the sphere contact issues within the current syntactic foams. Point contact between spheres can contribute to failure from stress concentrations. We propose to coat the higher strength ceramic spheres with an elastomeric resin, reducing stress and the risk of failure.", 30171.0, 1122102.0, 3, 7, "CERASPHERE", null, "http://www.trelleborg.com", null, "fp7_185472_952094383"]]}}, "9PT": {"cordis": {"data": [[1320105600000, 1388448000000, "Development of an automated spot weld inspection device for safe vehicle repair", "Karl Vella Autobody Repairs Ltd", "There are over three thousand spot welds in a typical car. When a car is repaired the spot welding parameters can be different as the mass production machinery used in manufacture can no longer be used. The repairer often is not an expert at inspecting spot welds. Assured reliability of the spot weld is paramount, since the integrity of the spot welds is vital to the crash performance of a car and the safety of its passengers. Therefore, there is a need for a rapid non-destructive inspection device that can be operated by somebody without specialist skills. SpotTrack proposal is for creating the first automatic spot weld tracking device that can be applied non-destructively in the automotive repair industry.\n\nThe only inspection option available to body repair shops today is to create a spot weld on an off-cut and carry out a \u2018peel test\u2019 on it, which is destructive. However, the assumption that the test spot weld is identical to the one on the car can be unsatisfactory. In some cases the spot weld may not be tested at all. The new SpotTrack device will allow the user to quickly and reliably tell whether a spot weld is acceptable by giving a simple pass or fail indication. The proposed SpotTrack system will have the advantage of testing the actual weld made within a matter of seconds and without the need for interpretation. Most importantly it will ensure that the actual spot welds going into service are safe.", 9542.0, 1207323.0, 7, 9, "SpotTrack", null, "http://www.karlvella.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112547.jpg", "fp7_100886_963986486"]]}}}}
