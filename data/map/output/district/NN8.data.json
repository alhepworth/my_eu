There are four schools in our partnership. One from the UK, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. The objectives of the project are- to create feeling of friendship and solidarity with European children during working on the same topics of project-to develop teamwork among children of each partner country and creating sounds/ music which combine the skills and creativity-to make children aware of  the European cultural diversity introducing partners`countries through games, music etc.-to help children find out about other countries\u00b4 traditions through mobilities and using ICT-to improve our students ICT competence using Skype, facebook, emails and homepage in eTwinning -to motivate pupils to learn, using innovative and creative teaching methods - to experience the importance and pleasure of learning Science and ICT-through this project the teachers will get the opportunity to broaden their horizon. The contacts with foreign colleagues could work reflectively. This project will sharpen their motivation and develop skills through sharing good practice of teaching and assessment procedures.-to enhance a European dimension into school and local community making exhibitions and project-evenings for local communityWe have planned five activities for children as well as five training sessions for adults. Each partner school has been given responsibility for organising and taking the lead on one of the activities planned. The learning activities planned for children are -- Exploring the links between electricity and sound/ Sound inventions - Science- Music powered by electricity - exploring music as a form of communication that can change the way of feelings, thinking and acting; exploring and creating sound using new technologies - ICT- Programming rhythm - ICT- Composition - write a song about sounds - Music- Music appreciation - exploring and responding to work of famous composers using electronic instruments - MusicThis project brought together different types of schools - some specialise in Special Education Needs, one is a mainstream school with designated special provision or inclusion and one school without any experience in SEN provision, though having children with learning difficulties. We wanted to compare and contrast special needs provision in different European Countries as well as share best practice, knowledge and experience. Some schools have previously been involved in Comenius Projects. Through their knowledge of eTwinning the teachers collaborated via eTwinning to plan and discuss a future project. We aim to deliver several training activities during the mobilities - Professional development is a core principle of the project as we would like teachers to observe each other when they visit schools and discuss techniques and methodologies they use.eTwinning training materials and ICT resourcesAmazing ICTKniess methodTraining in logorhythmics andScientific activity ideasDuring mobilities children and teachers will have opportunities to visit other classrooms, observe teaching strategies and engage in teaching and learning activities regardless of abilities or needs. The mobilities are also an opportunity to experience and engage with other European cultures.The project will prepare pupils for their social and professional life, by stimulating their creativity, spontaneity, ICT competencies and language skills by working in a multicultural space. By the end of this project we would like to see a progress in children's results in Science and Computing. We are hoping to see at least 10% progress in comparison with previous years. There should be an increase in children's interest, especially girls (girl's are underachieving in many European countries in Computing and Science) in studying Science and Computing through involving them into cross-curricular activities. The activities involving Music are very motivating for all the children.Parents and carers will have opportunities to be more involved and engaged in their children's life, especially in disadvantaged areas. The results of the project will be used and exploited continuously  in a long term by maintaining and  developing  after the end, for example-dissemination of training to staff who did not attend the training, -a more creative and motivating cross-curricular teaching for all children, -a greater understanding of children's individual needs, -better inclusion of all children irrespective of needs, -maintenance of the project website with additional information from schools regarding the project impact,-inclusion of the project into the curriculum to ensure learning impacts all subjects-motivated and inspired teachers who will go on to motivate and inspire others", "http://www.rowangateprimary.co.uk", "Rowan Gate Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024418_coordinator"], [2017, "Professional Development of Staff through European training activities", "Rowan Gate Primary School", 24230.0, 1, 1, "Rowan Gate is a community day special school for pupils aged 2+ to 11+ designated to offer 100 places in Wellingborough and 56 places in Rushden.

It is one of the most variable human diseases with complex, multi-systemic and progressively worsening clinical manifestations. Despite the huge impact of DM1 on the daily life of both patients and their family members, DM1 patients fail to receive the quality of healthcare that is available as they are not assertive users of the health care system.\nThere is no cure for DM1. The aim of treatment is to relieve impairments, reduce limitations and support participation in everyday activities. Based on our DM1-specific model which shows that physical activity and experienced fatigue are main determinants of DM1 health status (Kalkman 2007), OPTIMISTIC investigates the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in combination with exercise training  to improve functional capacity and to stimulate an active lifestyle.\nOPTIMISTIC compares the outcome of a treatment regimen with regular management in a multi-centre, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial, designed to 1) result in evidence-based clinical guidelines on exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy in DM1, 2) capture clinically meaningful changes in existing and novel outcome measures, and 3) identify both individual and composite biomarkers as surrogate treatment outcome measures that are reflective of the disease state.\nThere is an urgent need for an European clinical trial infrastructure for DM1. High prioritization of this is required to enhance the speed of clinical development of new putative DM1 therapeutics approaching the market.
