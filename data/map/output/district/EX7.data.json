The largest number of people employed in Kurzeme Region in 2015 were in the manufacturing and\r\npower industry (19 %), and trade, accommodation and catering services\u2019 industry (16 %); and the largest total value added in\r\nKurzeme region was generated by such industries as manufacturing, transport and storage, retail and wholesale, and the repair of\r\ncar and motorbikes. Thus it can be concluded that the students to be involved in the mobility represent from those industries, which\r\nmeet the demand of the labour market.\r\nWithin the project it is intended to organize 3-weeks internships to England for 6 students of the catering and hospitality speciality, and 4-weeks internship for 8+8 students of the hotel services' and catering services' specialities to Spain.\r\nThe aim of the project is to facilitate the improvement of personal and vocational skills, to carry out additional training, improve skills\r\nand knowhow of the selected profession, as well as to get to know the international labour market and its requirements, and to\r\nincrease the prestige of vocational education.
