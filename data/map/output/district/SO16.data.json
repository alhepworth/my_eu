Geodata, or geospatial data, are nowadays collected and produced with various sensors and techniques which provide for images, 3D point clouds, thematic maps, etc. Geodata are used in many Geosciences and for various applications such as urban planning, territorial management, damage assessment, environmental monitoring, 3D city modelling, renewable energy assessment, land registry, heritage documentation, etc. Despite a growing market, a large number of applications, a vast series of publications and various acquisition and processing techniques, there are still many unresolved research questions on the automation of processing procedures, and on how to make them more reliable, powerful and scale-invariant. Moreover, an efficient availability, access and use of geospatial data are often missing. This hinders the growth of new applications and societal welfares.

Here we propose an advanced transformative technology termed EDIT combining a novel high-resolution ultrasound elastography and photoacoustic imaging on the bladder instilled with targeted plasmonic gold sensors.\nEDIT approach exploits the structural and mechanical properties of the bladder extracellular matrix (ECM) as a unique biomarker of the early onset/progression/relapse of carcinoma, through engineered novel gold nanorods (GNRs) used as intravesical photoacoustic antennas targeted at the ECM, generating an ad hoc visualization platform. GNRs will be further utilized as heat-releasing effectors at nanoscale for targeted cancer photo-thermal therapy.

Merck has participated in the Leonardo da Vinci Mobility Project since 2002. During the assingment our trainees receive a project to work on or support the employees in their daily work. The project is coordinated and monitored during the whole time by the responsible person in Darmstadt. Having organised the project for so many years established a great and trustful network between the partners and the project leader in Darmstadt. Our partners are either subsidiarys of our company or universities.The main reason for running short term assignments for apprentices is besides enriching their language skills, building up an international network at a very early stage and also getting to know different ways of working and also develop intercultural skills. By offering these assignments Merck develops very young employees and the results are: more self-confidence and open minded employees, higher ability to work in international teams, increased identification with company, high flexibility and higher willingness to perform.With this project, 51 apprentices will receive the possibilty of a short-term assignment of 3 to 6 months duration within the following countries: Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland and France. Additionally, we schedule 3 trainer assignments abroad. This has already been carried out in the past, but this time initially within our project application.We have a new partner organisation (university) in Sweden involved and are in discussions with a further partner organisation (Merck company/subsidiary) in the Netherlands as well.Merck will apply again for the mobility charta offered by the EU in 2016.", "http://www.merck-performance-materials.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002996_1"], [2015, "NetWorking Europe", "Merck Chemicals Ltd.", 28819.0, 7, 9, "Merck is the oldest pharmaceutical and chemical company in the world.

Conventional optical fibres are small, low-cost and can be seamlessly integrated in materials, in engineering structures and in the environment. By exploiting the most advanced light-matter interactions, these tiny luminous wires can realize distributed sensing, which means that each point along an optical fibre can separately and selectively sense quantities such as temperature, strain, acoustic waves and pressure, in perfect similarity to a real organic nerve.\nThese remarkable features have attracted the interest of different end-users covering application domains as diverse as pipeline protection, oil and gas well exploitation, electricity transport, perimeter, fire alarm, etc., leading to a sustained market growth in the last years. However, the full potential of state-of-the-art distributed fibre sensing is exploited in a fairly narrow range of applications only. This is mainly due to the lack of trained scientific personnel capable of creating the link between the sensors and possible applications.\nThe ambition of FINESSE is therefore to educate and to train researchers in the development of a set of disruptive new optical 'artificial nervous systems' with improved sensitivity, precision and new sensing abilities, and to boost the industrial uptake of these sensors by training these researchers to valorise their work.\nThe ultimate vision empowering the project is the widespread implementation of fibre-optic nervous systems dedicated to: (i) contributing to a safer society by returning early warnings for danger and (ii) ensuring sustainable development through the efficient exploitation of natural resources.
