They provide same advantages, and at the same time, bring new questions we need to deal with as people working with youth (as workers or volunteers).\r\n\r\nThis is why In this training, we will explore together three very different areas (Emotions, New technologies / social media, and Nature) with the following objectives:\r\n1. To gain basic understanding of new challenges brings from the new technologies and social media to young people.\r\n2. To raise awareness about emotional intelligence meaning and development.\r\n3. To discover mindfulness as a tool for development.\r\n4. To explore the added value of nature and discover that is possible to combine it with the use of the new technologies and emotional intelligence.\r\n5. To develop new skills and strategies to be able to better support young people in becoming more confident and entrepreneur in your community.\r\n6. To promote cooperation between the different partners after the course.\r\n7. To promote the Erasmus+ programme as a tool for working with young people.\r\n\r\nIt will be a 7-day training course (including travelling) for 28 participants (youth leaders or youth workers) plus team, from 15 different countries (Portugal, Spain, Poland, Latvia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Cyprus, Croatia, Hungary, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Turkey, United Kingdom, Romania and Greece.).\r\n\r\nAfter this course, participants will be better prepared as youth workers and youth leaders for their activities in their organizations; they will be able to make their youngsters more aware of modern challenges and to prepare them to deal with them; they will help them to bring balance that will empower these young people to find their place in the labor market and/or to take their own entrepreneur initiatives. \r\n\r\nThe direct and sustainable impact in the own participants of this training, will be that they will gain competences (skills, knowledge and attitudes), will live experiences and meet contacts that will help them to improve like modern leaders, finding a balance between personal development (emotional intelligence), new technologies (internet and social media) and nature, to become more aware of their role and possibilities in their organizations, and can impel them to become jumbled in new activities and to promote them (therefore, becoming more confident and entrepreneur, and being able to motivate others to do so).", "http://global-hands.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-PT02-KA105-002053_12"]]}}, "3JD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "WELLVET", "Evolve Education", 213463.0, 5, 6, "A briefing for head teachers, governors and staff in education settings, published in 2014 by Public Health England, states that it is already proven that students with better health and wellbeing are likely to achieve better academically, as well as that effective social and emotional competencies are associated with greater health and wellbeing, and better achievement in life. Within the VET sector teachers and trainers predominantly focus on developing students\u2019 vocational knowledge and skills. Nevertheless, educational and professional accomplishment is determined to a great extent by good physical health, emotional wellbeing and opportunities for personal development. High quality, inclusive and flexible VET provision may prevent and remedy early school dropout, as well as contribute to enhancing students\u2019 employability and potential for success in life.\r\n\r\nThe WELLVET project aims is to:\r\n\u2022 equip VET teachers with innovative knowledge and competences on how to enhance their students\u2019 motivation to learn, practice and work;\r\n\u2022 to contribute to increasing the attainment levels among VET students;\r\n\u2022 to assist VET institutions and decision makers in recognizing the interrelation between emotional wellbeing of students and their success in acquiring vocational knowledge and skills for higher employability;\r\n\u2022 to foster a truly inclusive education and training based on addressing the common need for wellbeing among students and trainees, with particular focus on those from difficult or disadvantaged backgrounds.\r\n\r\nOur transnational cooperation will involve six organisations supported by five associated partners, from five countries \u2013 the United Kingdom, Poland, Bulgaria, Greece and the Czech Republic.\r\n\r\nAs a result from this project, a bespoke online training course will be developed, which will:\r\n-transcend the role of the VET teacher from a \u201cknowledge and skills provider\u201d to a mentor, offering holistic support for students\u2019 emotional, social and physical wellbeing.\r\n-offer horizontal strategies to be applied across all vocational fields and subjects to contribute increasing students\u2019 motivation, attainment levels and wellbeing.\r\n-produce a strong added value for VET teachers and encourage them to reflect on their own physical and emotional wellbeing as first condition for better occupational performance.\r\n\r\nWe expect that more than 1600 individuals will benefit from or will be target of the activities organised by the WELLVET project. As part of the implementation, we envisage extensive testing and evaluation to confirm the applicability and potential for multiplication and transferability of our course.\r\n\r\nAmong the impacts we expect to achieve are:\r\n\r\nVET TEACHERS\r\n\u2022 improved knowledge base on how to enhance students\u2019 motivation to learn, practice and work through health and wellbeing mentoring; enhanced skill base to apply innovative holistic methods and techniques in VET to support the teaching process; enhanced competency levels to foster inclusive education where each student\u2019s wellbeing matters; expanded professional development opportunities to match students\u2019 real needs for comprehensive support.\r\n\r\nVET STUDENTS\r\n\u2022 enhanced physical, mental and emotional wellbeing leading to increased attainment levels and subsequently employability; enhanced motivation to learn, practice and work.\r\n\r\nOTHER STAKEHOLDERS\r\n\u2022 enhanced awareness of the necessity to foster students\u2019 wellbeing in order to support their vocational and personal development; enhanced knowledge base on how to apply innovative methods to impact the VET system and enhance further its quality.\r\n\r\nWe strongly believe that inclusive education and training is built on caring for each and every student, getting to know and analyse individual needs not only with regard to knowledge and skills, but also in relation to how and what students feel about themselves, the school environment, their professional aspirations and personal development. We are also convinced that WELLVET can contribute to transforming VET into a system that caters for all students, irrespectively of their ethnic background, aptitudes, aspirations, since what is common for all of us is that wellbeing is the basic drive for our motivation to learn, work, live.", "http://www.evolveeducation.co.uk", "Evolve Education", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA202-036539_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"data": [[1456790400000, 1472601600000, "Keighley CLLD", "Keighley and Ilkley Voluntary and Community Action (KIVCA)", "The Keighley CLLD aims to operate across Keighley East, West and Central wards of Bradford Metropolitan District Council.

The increase of the capacity to perform nano-safety assessment will be realised by innovative instrumentation developments for HTP and high content analysis (HCA) approaches. Toxicogenomics on chip is also one embedded objective. Our interdisciplinary approach focuses on tools to maximise the read-across and to assess applicable endpoints for advanced risk assessment of nanomaterials (NM). The main goal is thus to establish individual chip-based microfluidic tools as devices for (nano)toxicity screening which can be combined as an on-line HTP platform. Seven different chip-based sensor elements will be developed and hierarchically combined via a flow system to characterise toxicity pathways of NM. The HISENTS platform allows the grouping and identifying of NM. Parallel to the screening, the pathway and interaction of NM in biological organisms will be simulated using the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. Using the different sensor modules from the molecular to cell to organ level, HISENTS can input quantitative parameters into the PBPK model resulting in an effective pathway analysis for NM and other critical compounds. The developed platform is crucial for realistic nano-safety assessment and will also find extensive application in pharmaceutical screening due to the flexible modifications of the HTP platform. The specific objective is the development of a multimodular HTP platform as new a screening tool for enhancing the efficiency of hazard profiling.
