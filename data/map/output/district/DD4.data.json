They require to build effective teams and solve problems in a fast paced environment in a collaborative fashion.  Work-based learning must follow suit and this raises the question of how apprentices/trainees are supported, mentored and assessed in the work-place.    Similarly there is a  need for employers to recognize how trainees are engaged in today's VET centres in teaching and learning in order that  there is a 'joined up' approach. between the two. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposal is to increase the skills of tutors in company to be able to host, train, monitor and assess the apprentices/students and design a process to facilitate the participation of SMEs in the dual VET system (or any other scheme of hosting students in companies).  The project will aim to promote a training culture amongst companies, especially SMEs, through awareness raising activities and utilizing  the experience of companies with a prior experience of hosting VET students and showing the beneficial results for the organization.\r\n\r\nThe DELTA  industry partners will include both large enterprises and niche players in a range of industries all with a need to develop new forms of support and assessment in the skills and competences that are required in today\u2019s workplace.  By involving industry partners  the project will create real applications and methodologies that will work across multiple sectors, and tried and tested in a 'real world' setting.  \r\n\r\nThese include the IOs: \r\n\r\n1) The DELTA Digital Portfolio - where trainees can demonstrate to employers their skills and how they learn in their VET centre\r\n2) The DELTA Toolkit is a set of documents and materials aimed at companies in order to assist them in the process of hosting a VET student, including the assessment of the student and  the impact the hosting has had on the company.\r\n3) The DELTA Collaborative Apprenticeship Schemes for SMEs.  This output is intended for those companies which are too small or too specific to be able to take apprentices (eg because they cannot dedicate personal resources or because they cannot cover all the curriculum to meet the needs of the apprenticeship).\r\n\r\nTwo sets of multiplier events  are planned to maximize the promotion of the IOs and gain more exposure for the project processes to industry and education leaders. \r\n\r\nTransnationality is at the heart of the project in different ways.  It addresses a European problem -  the lack of competences and expertise of tutors in companies when hosting VET learners. Also there will be an exchange of good practices among the participating countries in companies involvement and implementation of apprenticeships schemes (like it is the case of Italy and UK) or dual VET programmes (like the case of Spain) and the comparison of the VET systems in the different countries in order to contribute to a better transparency and knowledge of them among the participating organisations.", null, "DUNDEE AND ANGUS COLLEGE", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA202-036810_6"]]}}}}
