The film, which will be made using hand-drawn animation and hand-painted backgrounds, promises to be a beautifully crafted, timeless classic for a young audience which will prove the jewel in the crown of any holiday TV schedule.  When Grandma\u2019s car breaks down, Mum and Dad go to her rescue, leaving their teenage son Stan in charge of their younger children Katie, Rosie, Max and the baby. Spurred on by Rosie\u2019s love of bears and Dad\u2019s insistence that they go and get some fresh air, the children decide it would be fun to go on a bear hunt. Rufus, the family dog, picks up a scent and leads the children through increasingly challenging countryside, wading through a river, squelching through mud and creeping through a dark forest. Struggling through a snowstorm to a deserted beach, they follow a trail of bear prints that lead them to a narrow gloomy cave. Once inside, Rosie and Rufus become separated from the others and end up in a dark passageway. Switching on her torch Rosie finds herself face to face with a huge bear! Initially frightened, Rosie soon realises that he is just old and lonely and needs looking after. She combs his fur and gives him something to eat. As the appreciative old bear envelops her in a great big hug, the other children suddenly appear. Stan, despite Rosie\u2019s attempts to explain, grabs her and, together with the other children, they run all the way home. Later that evening the parents return home with Grandma, and play along with the children\u2019s story of their bear hunt. As the merriment begins at home, Rosie can\u2019t stop thinking about the bear. She quietly sings a sentimental song, which is carried by the wind to the seashore where the bear stops to listen. Rosie\u2019s voice is now no more than a whisper as the bear disappears back into his cave, the waves washing away his paw prints in the sand.", "http://www.lupusfilms.com", "BEAR HUNT FILMS LIMITED", "creative_572290-CREA-1-2016-1-UK-MED-TV_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "LUPUS FILMS LIMITED*", 174287.0, "MEDIA -programme \u2014 Operating transnationally and internationally and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (09.05.01)", "fts_2017_40510"]]}}, "0PW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "International Youth Volunteering Programme", "British Red Cross", 202741.0, 8, 22, "The British Red Cross International Youth Volunteering Project's mission is to provide high quality long-term international volunteering experiences to 29 young people from across Europe, aged 18-30.

This transition requires adoption of novel reactor technologies, greener reactions and the increase in the use of intelligent systems in processing industries. The latter means improving processes through use of real-time information and ability to affect processes in real time. The long-term vision of COOPOL is to develop new methods and tools for modeling and control, based on real-time sensing, which will facilitate the development of a new paradigm of processes: intensive, low-impact, sustainable chemical technologies. The COOPOL consortium is focusing on one of the key areas of interest to European Chemical Industries, namely the polymer industry. Within the chemicals sector polymer production plays a significant role, with European market share of 25% and providing employment to 1.6 million people within EU27.\nMany polymer products are manufactured using batch and semi-batch reactors. In most cases the process parameters, such as temperature profile, feeds, etc follow a specific time schedule, which has been fixed after an expensive period of product and process development. This tight recipe schedule is sensitive against disturbances e.g., unexpected variation in operating conditions, variation in feed purity etc., which inevitably leads to variations in polymer structure and\u00a0to inter-batch variability and off-spec products. Furthermore, the use of empirically determined recipes with fixed-time controls does not allow intensification of the process which requires time-varying feeds and reactor temperature to run the reaction faster and hence closer to its limits,  and also to switching from a semi-batch to other reactor or process types.\nCOOPOL addresses the complex issues of real-time process control based on advanced models and on-line sensors, to develop a generic basis for widely applicable sustainable intensified processes. COOPOL will develop a new process control approach, linking molecular level information and understanding of the reaction chemistry with real-time sensing, rigorous modeling based on first principles, subsequent model reduction and non-linear model-predictive control (NMPC) with economic objectives, called dynamic real-time optimisation (DRTO). The approach of COOPOL is to develop robust real-time optimisation-based control and sensing methodologies and through their application to achieve, in parallel, the intensification of (i) the existing processes, and (ii) the development of novel intensive \u2018smart-scale\u2019 processes.

The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the upper secondary schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and S:t Eskils gymnasium, have previously had an Erasmus + KA1 VET project (2014-2016) and they also have an ongoing KA1 VET project (2016-2018). In these projects, the results have been very good and the cooperation with our partner organizations has expanded and deepened. Our goal and intention is to continue to develop this work so that more and more students have the opportunity to do training abroad because it leads to so many positive aspects.\r\n\r\nThis project includes the vocational programs Childcare, Health care, Restaurant, Trade (retail) and Administration, Vehicle maintenance and Transportation, Construction, Tourism as well as Hairdresser.   During 2018-2020, a total of 120 Students will do practical training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Malta for 2-5 weeks. The training is consistent with the objectives of the different programs and courses and therefore the students gain more knowledge in their field. It gives the students an opportunity to practice what they learned at schools and at their local placements, but in a different context from what they are used to. Students will also be able to learn other methods or techniques, which they may not have learned at school or at their internship at home. They get a chance to discuss and compare what they learn. This is beneficial also to other students in the program because there is a large degree of dissemination of the students\u2019 experiences and knowledge once they come home.\r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the practical training abroad helps make the vocational programs more popular.  For many years Eskilstuna had a decreasing number of applicants for the vocational programs.  However, since 2016, we have seen a turnaround as many of the programs have received a larger number of applicants. It is important that this continues, because Eskilstuna and the rest of the country have a need for skilled labor.  \r\n\r\nThe training can also act as a motivator for students to attend classes and be responsible about the school work, and thus decrease the risk of their becoming drop-outs.  The experience strengthens the students and makes them more confident.  It contributes therefore to the students having the strength and ambition to finish their studies.    The students develop their problem solving skills, their ability to become responsible and their courage because they have to learn how to handle new situations and express themselves in a different language.  This is important for their future, for their ability to finish their studies and start new ones and also to find employment.  The youth unemployment rate of Eskilstuna is 15.5% and our goal is that the students will be more willing to commute and  look for work in other places, if needed- which is something they perhaps wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to do or wouldn\u2019t have thought of otherwise, if they hadn\u2019t done the training abroad.   \r\nDuring the training the students also develop their language ability (especially English) which is essential in a labor market which becomes more and more global, where companies need to have staff who can communicate with clients and other companies around the world.  \r\n\r\nOur municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, and the consortium has a need to always work with these issues, to increase the tolerance and and empathy for others.  The students\u2019 practical training in other European countries contributes to a larger intercultural understanding since they can experience a different culture and meet people of a different background than themselves.  It also contributes to an understanding for how it might feel to arrive in a foreign country, and to have difficultites expressing oneself.  There are many newly arrived studentens in our schools and our hope is that these training periods can contribute to a greater understanding for them and their situations.  \r\n\r\nThis project also includes job shadowing activities in France for 6 teachers at the Vehicle/Transportation program.  The teachers want to develop their language ability, discuss pedagogics, didactics, curriculum and lesson plans, and thus have an opportunity to get new ideas and inspiration, learn new techniques etc from a program similar to their own.

The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and St Eskils gymnasium, currently has an Erasmus+ KA1 VET project which will end in June, 2016.    We intend to continue the collaboration that we have with our partners from that project and also add some new ones.   The number of participating students in our new project will be increased from 72 to 104 and they are in vocational programs within the fields of Restaurant, Trade and administration, Building, Mechanics, Childcare, Nursing and health care, Hairdressing and Hotel /Tourism.   These students will do vocational training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxemburg and Malta for 2-5 weeks.  Furthermore, five teachers from the programs Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism will do job shadowing in Great Britain and the Netherlands.  The municipality of Eskilstuna, like many other municipalities in Sweden, struggles with a decreasing number of students applying for vocational programs, a high number of students who do not finish their education, high youth unemployment and also increasing problems of racism and hostility towards immigrants.  The consortium needs to offer high quality vocational programs, prevent drop-outs and also increase the knowledge of languages and trade related subjects among the students.  Moreover, the students\u2019 personal development is important in terms of self-confidence, intercultural understanding and tolerance of others.  Vocational training abroad and the international dimension that it offers, can contribute a lot in these areas and lead to a better future for many people.   Vocational training abroad gives the students experiences out of the ordinary and makes the vocational programs more interesting and appealing.  It gives the students more knowledge within the field, they get to experience different kinds of techniques and ways of doing things and also different ways of thinking.  The job shadowing in the Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism programs will add positive aspects to the programs, with new ideas and also a collaborative project between the different schools including the vocational subjects and English. This international dimension will be positive for the students and increase their knowledge in these subjects. The vocational training leads to great personal development for the students in terms of self-confidence, the ability to communicate in a different language (especially English), having  more faith in their abilities and a greater courage.  Being able to spend time in a foreign country without one\u2019s family is a big step to take and contributes a lot to the students\u2019 self-confidence and the feeling of having had the courage and succeeded.   It can inspire students who are at risk of not completing their education to actually find the strength to do so.  Vocational training abroad can also make it easier for student to find employment .  In combination with a greater self-confidence and better knowledge of the field, the increased knowledge of foreign languages can make the students more employable.   These students will be important in a job market which is becoming more and more global.   We believe that these students can inspire others to find the courage and perhaps look for employment elsewhere, since unemployment is very high in Eskilstuna. During the training abroad the students get to experience a different culture than their own.  They meet people of different backgrounds, and get a better understanding for intercultural differences.  Since they have to speak a foreign language, they will better understand the difficulties that this can mean when somebody is  trying to make him- or herself understood in a language that is not his or her own.  We hope for positive effects of dissemination when students share their experiences with friends or classmates, and that this will create a better understanding for, and acceptance of, newly arrived asylum seeking students and other immigrants.

Participating in the project is also a group of students with special needs.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere are many objectives of a project like this, and for the students it involves both professonal ones and personal ones.  The 72 students that we'd like to send abroad will get training in their respective field, training that corresponds to the objectives in the our national curriculum.  \r\n\r\nOur goal is also that the students develop on a personal level, as a result of intercultural learning.  Since our students change country for a while, meet and cooperate with people who speak a different language and who have different backgrounds but work in the same field. they get a larger intercultural understanding.   This kind of project gives the students an increased knowledge of foreign languages, and it promotes the study of languages. \r\n\r\nWe want the students to spread information about their experiences doing vocational training abroad, to inspire other students to do the same.

The project can also have a positive impact on their belief in themselves to apply for jobs and possibly make them more inclined to look for work somewhere else.  They see that they can handle working far away from home, or they get curious about doing something like this from listening to their friends sharing their experiences.

The HTL Hallein and it's partner schools will provide work placements abroad. These internships should give the students the opportunity to learn for their future careers and also to do a lot for their individual development. Managing their everyday life abroad is a new experience for most of the students . Organizing living, food, public transport, etc. is a great challenge for them.\r\nIn the summer holiday 2014, 10 students of the HTL Hallein will do their interships abroad. Therefore the HTL Hallein established partnerships with different schools in England and the Netherlands. Every partner has to organize the internships for the students coming from abroad. HTL Hallein looks for companies which can provide internships in the greater area of Salzburg. In June/July and September/October students from Sheffield and Drachten will come to Hallein and teachers of the HTL Hallein will support these students during their stay here in Hallein. \r\nThe cooperation between the schools from Sheffield, Drachten and Hallein was established in the last years during different Comeniusprojects. The partnerships have become very stable in the meantime. We organize the projects and keep in touch mostly by e-mail. During the last years we have got the possibility to hold conversations face to face a few times. During these meetings it was possible to discuss all the problems and fix up the strategies for the future.\r\nOn the basis of these internships the students should learn to cope with the problems that arise from living abroad and can realize the chances of going abroad. The employees of the different companies are forced to use English for communication.  Most of them need not  speak English at work or at home. During the internships the students have to communicate in English. So they will lose the inhibition of speaking English and get in contact with foreign people.\r\nThe first days abroad the students will be integrated into the everyday life at school. So they should become acquainted to schools abroad. After that first phase they will work for 3 to 4 weeks at different companies. During their interships the students should frequently report about their expierences and jobs. At the end of the interships the students will write summaries and will be able to have presentations at school and for the local press.\r\nIn the future the HTL Hallein will try to organize longer stays abroad for our students. They should attend schools abroad for minimum of 6 months. But untill now we have not built up the basic conditions.

This title will be presented in public and should be a standard for the high qualitiy of this education at the HTL Hallein. With this project teachers should have the possibility to get in contact with other international schools and pupils should be put in contact with other schools as well to do an intership in other countries. Therefore pupils should get the chance to find a place for their individual needs.\r\nFor that purpose a teacher is sent, who has successfully passed the stonemason exam in Austria and the sculptor qualification in Laas, South Tirol in Italy.

There, one keystone for robots to carry out accurate and intelligent tasks, with and for people, is their ability both to handle autonomously all sorts of objects and to use human tools. However, today's robots are unable to achieve dexterous and fine manipulation, especially when this requires in-hand manipulation. They are far from being able to understand and reason about their environments, their goals and their own capabilities, to learn skills and improve their performance by what they have been taught and their own experience, to interact with their environments with the efficiency of humans.The HANDLE project aims at understanding how humans perform the manipulation of objects in order to replicate grasping and skilled in-hand movements with an anthropomorphic artificial hand, and thereby move robot grippers from current best practice towards more autonomous, natural and effective articulated hands.

Acute and persistent pain of different origins represent a common medical, social, and economic burden, and its pharmacotherapy is often inadequate.

We anticipate including Italy in 2019 and Ireland and Portugal in 2020.\r\n\r\nAim 2: Increase employment outcomes\r\n\u2022 Objective C: Expand the number and range of host employers\r\n\u2022 Objective D: Increase the overall number of mobilities provided\r\n\r\nCapacity London continues to work with City & Guilds to offer courses from its suite of Digital Media and Creative Industries qualifications. Due to growing demand and the continued success rate of students on these courses we have decided to focus mobilities on these core areas. Teaching English is anticipated to be offered again in 2019 and discussions are on going with new potential host employers.\r\n\r\nAdditional host employers have been identified in Spain, the Czech Republic and France, which will enable us to offer a higher number of mobilities.\r\n\r\nAim 3: Increase progression to further learning\r\n\u2022 Objective E: Inclusion and Development of ECVET\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on a KA2 project \u2018ECVET for Creative Industries\u2019 to support curriculum development and facilitate credit transfer so that learners can continue to work towards their qualifications whilst undertaking mobilities. \r\n\r\nAim 4: Enhance organisational capacity within international contexts\r\n\u2022 Objective F: Increase language competence within organisation \r\n\u2022 Objective G: Increased Organisational Capacity Inline with Mobility Growth\r\n\r\nOur Erasmus+ provision falls within the scope of our Matrix Accreditation and we will work with Host Employers to support them in integrating Matrix methodologies and systems within their learner support functions.\r\n\r\nAs our European activities develop and expand, we continue to ensure staff develop relevant skills, for example by integrating a European dimension into our IAG services by providing detailed information about living and working in the destination countries for our Erasmus+ projects.  \r\n\r\nCapacity London staff benefit from the contribution the Erasmus+ projects make to language competences by providing opportunities for practice and development of language skills. This will continue as new destination countries are added.\r\n\r\n2) Mobility Flows\r\nThe project workplan and timetable will deliver a total of 90 3-month ErasmusPro Mobilities based around three \u2018lifecycles\u2019 with the following departure dates:\r\n\r\n1st cycle: Sep-Dec 2018 \u2013 21 Mobilities to Spain, 6 to Czech Republic, 3 to France\r\n\r\n2nd cycle: Jan-Apr 2019 \u2013 21 Mobilities to Spain, 6 to Czech Republic, 3 to France\r\n\r\n3rd cycle: Apr-July 2019 \u2013 21 Mobilities to Spain, 6 to Czech Republic, 3 to France\r\n\r\nWhilst this is an increase in the number of mobilities envisaged for 2018/19 within our Internationalisation Plan, it reflects our 2016 KA1 Mobility Project, which included a total of 98 3-month mobilities, 87 of which have been completed, with the remaining 11 underway and due to finish in April. Thus the proposed scope of the workplan is commensurate with capacity and delivery track record of Capacity London and the project partnership.\r\n\r\nWe had envisaged adding Ireland as a destination country but have added France via the development of partnerships with a cluster of Creative Industries employers in Perpignan.  These employers will provide high quality mobility placements that meet the needs of our participants and reflect the content of our VET provision and will also facilitate French language learning.\r\n\r\n3) Accompanying Persons\r\nWe will send an Accompanying Person to support the participants during the first stages of their mobilities as part of our duty of care to the young people undertaking work experience in another country. We have allocated a ratio of 1 Accompanying Person to every 9 participants and their key functions will be to:\r\n- Work with both the Host Employers and the Participants to ensure the start of the mobility work experience goes well;\r\n- Support participants in adapting to their new environment; and\r\n- Provide ongoing advice and support", "http://www.capacitylondon.co.uk", "CAPACITY LONDON LIMITED", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA116-047397_coordinator"], [2016, "Digital Media, Creative Industries and TEFL 2016", "CAPACITY LONDON LIMITED", 482223.0, 4, 39, "The DMCI TEFL 2016project will offer VET learners opportunities to gain valuable European work experience and knowledge within the Digital Media,  Creative Industries and Teaching English as a Foreign Language sectors.

The international strategy has been implemented on three levels; firstly, 33 students (trainee educators) take part in a 3 or 20-week placement abroad through the Erasmus+ programme, secondly, 8 teachers also take part in a foreign exchange programme with a chosen partner organization. \r\nThrough the comparative study of vocational training and education systems in both their own country and other European countries, students broaden their comprehension of the diverse ways in which to best support children in their development. The mobility offered to students through this programme provides an irreplaceable addition to the theoretical course, and is integral in developing conceptual, methodological and personal competences. Comparative analysis of curricular concepts, structure and attitude towards institutional education in different European countries, along with current debates, is an essential part of this vocational training. It also plays an important role in the establishment of our future European culture, and the evolution of the German educational system as a whole.\r\nThe lecturers of the vocational college, have an avowed interest in developing the international component of the training programme. Intercultural experiences and study of \u201cbest practice\u201d, provides them with competences to teach to the highest standards possible.\r\nDuring the project, 18 students complete a 20-week practical placement abroad, as a component of their overall training programme.  To ensure a complete monitoring of their placement, the students write weekly and monthly reports, which are reviewed by their tutor. Reflection and comparison of country-specific approaches to education are a focus of these reports. 15 students complete a 3-week foreign placement, principally in neighbouring countries. As an addition to their required training placements, this residence is undertaken to broaden their understanding of \u201cother\u201d educational systems and to gain intercultural experiences. \r\nThe teaching group (8 teachers) in the vocational training college is comprised of university\u2013educated personnel and trained teachers. The aim of both the institution and the faculty is to obtain the highest level of knowledge about the education and social care systems in different European countries and meet the requirements of the training programme.

However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.

The ultimate goal of this professional training period abroad is to allow our students to have a European dimension to their professional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in order to find work or continue their studies more easily. A professional training period abroad could also stimulate and motivate our students and help to fight against dropping out and bad results. We also wish to organize a period of mobility for 21 of our staff members in a professional training center and technological platform in another European country. This period could be very beneficial as it would allow us to discover new training techniques, new teaching methods to apply to mixed groups made of both adults and youngsters, and to organize an exchange with a European partner. Welcoming our partners in France would complete the experience and allow for innovation on both sides and allow 18 staff members from our European partner to take part in an individual mobility period in one of the structures of the host organization, the campus. This will allow both us and our partners to observe new methods, to exchange, to make the transfer of new methods possible. \r\nThe objectives are a part of the recommendations noted in the European reference documentation. The desire and the decision to propose these mobility periods in Europe corresponds to the specific needs of the actors of this professional field and to the aspirations of those being trained who wish to gain more skills and to find a job where such skills are needed. It also corresponds to the needs of our staff members who wish to exchange and innovate their own methods in order to make their students succeed and to open up new training periods with new subjects of study that correspond to the European job market.  \r\nWorking as a group has allowed us to find partners to welcome us in five different countries. Mutualizing these resources has been a key aspect to our mobility project. Il allows our schools to network abroad more efficiently, to stimulate the implication of French companies in the mobility project, to obtain better visibility of our schools and training facilities on a European level and to allow our students to continue their studies once they have completed their secondary school diploma. \r\nThis project is coherent with the local school board\u2019s policy to develop mobility periods abroad in this field of study. It is the result of wanting to work together to reinforce skills and methods of those who will take part in a mobility period and to allow the campus to be the initiator of the project. Mutualizing such means has allowed us to be much more dynamic in our approach to international mobility. \r\nThe content of this program has been defined and worked on with all of the secondary schools which have committed to respecting the different phases of the project: informing future participants, selecting them, preparing them to go abroad, evaluating the mobility period and diffusing contact lists. Thanks to the group work on the program content, the first documents such as an evaluation grid have been created. The group jointly decided on how to schedule the different phases of the program such as the preparation, the carrying out and the evaluation phases. It is this joint effort and coordination which will increase the value of the project for students and staff members. In fact, the different phases of the project implicate all of the Campus partners: vocational training schools and centers, universities, businesses, guilds, technological platforms. This project will also implicate actors such as consulates, associations, language assistants, comities in charge of twinning cities, cultural centers, both abroad and in France.\r\nThe role of each partner is clearly identified: Le GIPAL is in charge of the project from an administrative point of view.

Two new departments are joining the Erasmus+ project: Business and Pastry/Backery. This  Erasmus+ mobility is going to become a very powerful school project which will have a great impact on all of our  vocational departments.\r\nThe project  running team has decided to  rely on the most  qualified teachers in mobility activities from both departments to apply for a 24 month Erasmus+ project focusing  on  European citizenship , school dropout  and  youth unemployment. The choice of the participants has resulted  in  setting up a group of 184 students (boys/girls aged 16- 19 years old) who are completing year 2 and year 3 of their BTEC National Diploma  and are  attending European vocational  issue courses.\r\nTo meet our participants\u2019needs which are the enhancement and the acknowledgment of their vocational competences, our establishment relies on its international partners: a Polish hotel and catering High School since 2013 and very experienced international partners specialized in vocational training programs with whom strong links have been created during previous preparatory meetings to implement   vocational training courses and internship in local companies. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the mobility activities is to give our participants in year 2 and year 3 a different approach of the learning and the practice of their profession in order to improve and share their knowledge through cooking/service techniques and electricity / electronic applications :\r\n1. In Year 2 the participants will experience technical and theoretical training courses in an European school partner for two weeks in order to acquire different schemes of apprenticeship, to become more autonomous and to develop vocational objectives easy to reach in an unusual educational frame. They will be able to exchange their practice with their foreign counterparts in English and meet managers of local enterprises (restaurants/hotels/electricity and computing companies  )\r\n2. In year 3 the participants will be welcomed in foreign companies for four weeks in order to implement their working skills acquired in France, to adapt themselves to the requirements of their work placements and to expand a real autonomy in their apprenticeship and knowledge of a foreign language.\r\n In order to achieve the objectives of this project, the qualified teachers DNL/English use educational tools (E learning) and offer a remedial vocational teaching allowing the implementation of a specific training strategy adapted to the applicants\u2019 profile.\r\nThis preparation , prior to  the mobility period, spurs the motivated participants to be involved in their progress and to adapt themselves in a new vocational and linguistic environment.\r\nTo support this in-depth preparation, a thorough work from the project running team, in contact with the project partners and the participants\u2019 families, is done to ensure a control of logistic matters allowing a proper organization of the mobility activities from the start to the end. A timetable of the activities is elaborated and updated in order to make them run in the best possible conditions.\r\n\r\nTo exploit the outcomes of the mobility activities, the project running team   will use assessment tools to analyze and quantify the expected results in order to think about future educational, linguistic or vocational remedial courses. This assessment will be useful to improve the organization of future mobility projects.\r\nTo make our mobility project known locally and internationally, some communicative strategies will be implemented with our participants, teachers and partners to motivate other students and teachers and boost the positive outcomes : individual enhancement, vocational autonomy, cultural improvement and citizenship commitment.\r\nThis great team work will allow the fulfilment of the challenge taken up by our students: Mobility-Training, Learning differently and Heading for Europe.", "http://www.cei-work-travel-study.com/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036370_2"], [2014, "START +", "CENTRE D'ECHANGES INTERNATIONAUX LIMITED", 161239.0, 5, 5, "L\u00e9o Lagrange Nord is an actor of popular education and social economy for over 60 years.

We were able to measure, through a survey on a sample of Alumni European section students, the major benefits of such an experience. Indeed, ALL of them testified of the key role played by their mobility in their studies, their recruitment or employment.\r\nOur project has existed for 16 years and has continuously evolved in number and quality. We started with one destination, we now have three and soon to be four, (London, Dundee, Stoke on Trent and Malta). We went from a few students to almost a full class, thanks to the increasing involvement of our team and our partners  as well as the financial support of the Regional Council and the European Council. This expansion contributes to building a better reputation of our institution and of our area in terms of long education and employability of  the young people graduating from our school.\r\nOur partner companies are English-speaking, and mostly located in the UK. These companies are all the main asset of our project thanks to the full commitment of their teams. Indeed, our partnership is perennial and renewed every year which often allows us to encounter new potential partners wishing to take part within the project. Thus, thanks to the manager of the Michelin factory in Dundee, and after three  very positive experiences, we were able to find four other work placements for our students in Dundee this year.   We have been put in contact with the local Chamber of Commerce and also with Michelin, Stoke on Trent. It is also thanks to the Michelin factory director that we found host families approved by the University of Dundee. They host our students, making them feel at home, while allowing them to discover the cultural and civilizational dimension of Scotland.\r\nThat's also how we have met our partner school BRAEVIEW ACADEMY in Dundee.  That school is very similar to ours on many levels, same size, same students' profiles and same socio-professional category population. This year, we had our first physical exchange of students and teachers.\r\nIn London, the companies with whom we work - for some of them, since 2001 - have become active partners in our mobility project. The great confidence that has developed between the two parties since the beginning of our collaboration provides us very individualized and closely monitored training for our students, allowing us to find the best candidates for each company according to their professional and personal profiles. In London, the CEI is in charge of finding host families for our students, since we deeply believe that immersion is a major linguistic, cultural and civilizational asset. Again, the professionalism of this structure allows us to leave our youth with confidence, since in case of problems or emergency, the CEI is responsible for placing the young in another family (situation encountered only once in eight years).\r\nIn Malta, our experience is more recent. We called on an intermediary organization, Paragon Europe, which helped us find internships and accommodations. We have had only two experiments, which have given us entire satisfaction. We have also forged permanent links with Clive CORDINA and his team who have now moved their offices and set up a new company in Valletta. This company is called ZEAL. It was with this team that we tackled the needs of our students who would like to train abroad without being part of the European class.\r\nThanks to these mobilities, each year we see the benefit of these experiences being reflected in the percentage of success of the students concerned in the examinations as well as in the number of students going to college  (BTS, IUT, university ) but also in a better employability and quality employment opportunities of our students, enabling them to become genuine European citizens and actors.", "http://www.cei-work-travel-study.com/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046758_1"], [2017, "Mon Action de Citoyen et de Travailleur en Europe I & II", "CENTRE D'ECHANGES INTERNATIONAUX LIMITED", 50121.0, 3, 5, "The Erasmus + ACTE I & II project inaugurates the implementation of an European policy for our school and for all our students, Hispanic or Anglophones, as well as for our staff.

Two streams of voluntary student mobility (NVQ level 3) are planned: the 1st in March 2018 (year 2017-18), the 2nd in November 2018 (year 2018-19). We have chosen this level of study to respond to the concerns expressed by our partners regarding minors and to ensure better linguistic and technical preparation for our students who will be better able to perform complex tasks and can better benefit from this experience.\r\nWe take advantage of existing structures in our school like the Spanish European section to supervise the participants. For the English language, a personalized help group My ACTE European Mobility will be created, mixing NVQ level 2 and level 3 pupils, the 2nd stream being planned early in the school year, we have to prepare them as well as possible. They will benefit from the work done in the first year to get them involved as best as possible. This heterogeneity will be exploited as an asset: the level 3 students will become the trainers of their cadets at the time of their mobility. In addition to reassuring future candidates, this will create a team spirit and a cooperation around Europe. An hour will also be available for other teachers to assist students in their workshop preparation or in other subjects such as labor law (eco-management, environmental & health prevention) and European citizenship (history and geography). Several highlights mark our project: an anniversary calendar of Europe will organize fun and educational shows (themed meals, games / competitions); two citizen trips focused on the border issue, in the Spanish/French Basque Country and in Strasbourg-Kehl cities, with meetings with MPs; the creation of a traveling exhibition \"What is Europe for me a vocational school student?\" Intended to be distributed to the primary high schools of the urban area of Pau, and put online on the internet for all public after the year II. The students will not only follow a specific program, they will be involved from the beginning by being actors of their stay: animations, programs of cultural and professional visits, approaches with youth and tourist organizations, all mentioned in the log book. A growing autonomy but always safe thanks to the presence of our referring teachers on the spot for a first year in Spain. \r\nThe ACTE I & II project affirms a long-term commitment to the opening of our school to Europe, which can not be reduced to the mobility of students alone. Six staff members will carry out mobility in accordance with this objective (Belgium, Spain, Ireland, Germany, Portugal, Finland etc) to perfect language, cultures, professional practices etc. The delivery of certificates (Europass, etc.) will be a new opportunity at each school year's end to enhance the project and its participants by inviting the media, our administration and our local politicians to celebrate the success of our students in Europe.", "http://www.cei-work-travel-study.com/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036406_2"], [2014, "PASSEPORT POUR L'EUROPE", "CENTRE D'ECHANGES INTERNATIONAUX LIMITED", 49999.0, 4, 5, "The high school Le Rebours has been certified \"high school for business in accounting and commercial activities\" since 2008 and has got 1300 students (around).

Mobility should allow our trainees and teachers collaborate and integrate with the objectives of a work team, to communicate and dominate their oral expression, to adopt behaviors and attitudes that are in keeping with the diversity of relational contexts, particularly in terms of dress, the courtesy so dear to these Europeans. From a human point of view, mobility will help participants to manage time, perceive time constraints for themselves and their customers, anticipate hazards, perceive their limits, manage the stress inherent in workload and the language barrier and finally to show initiative within the limits of autonomy, curiosity, perseverance, involvement and motivation.Our trainees are already young adults through their previous  training periods in companies. On the spot, in a more autonomous way, they will learn to solve real situations with their own means: Dialogue in English or Spanish to make themselves understood and to be an active collaborator of the company; have exchanges with strangers (clients, training masters, foster parents; responding to professional situations;Directions in large cities include instructions.\r\nFinally, from a cultural point of view, the students will discover the locations of the films that took place in Dublin, Warsaw and the Albacete region: Games of track will be organized to discover these places. They will take pictures by staging themselves. These photos will be the subject of an exhibition that will showcase the project as a result of mobility.\r\nIn the long term, it is expected that 100% of the students in our school will have access to a 4-week internship abroad for the 22 weeks required by the curriculum. The benefit for our young people will be better employability. Staff trained to work with foreign clients will be an asset for the economic impact of our region.

Participants to this program may, during this placement:\r\n\r\n- put into practice and increase knowledge already acquired during their studies. According to their training and professional experience they  can work for example in shops, hotels, marketing services (business profiles), or any type of administrative structure (accounting, management profiles)\r\n\r\n- improve their command of English, which will be practiced in professional situations and in everyday life\r\n\r\n- increase their cultural and personal expertise, explore other ways of thinking or doing things and initiate new contacts.\r\n\r\nParticipants will gain new advantages for accessing to employment. They will benefit their future employers (or their own business, if that was their plan) of these new understandings and practices (practice of their profession in a foreign country, English, development of a new network abroad ...).\r\n\r\nThe ASSOCIATION ISFAP has set up a monitoring process for the candidates from the initial contact until they come back from the internship: information, application form, interview, working out on job search tools in English (CV, cover letter), administrative and linguistic preparation of the placement.

Meetings, telephone calls, mails, social networks, skype will be used to manage, communicate, cooperate, monitor and assess the mobility program. The students will be accompanied by the English teacher who will make sure the families and companies live up to the  personal and professional expectations (professional tasks in keeping with the school curriculum). The DNL teacher will fetch them and assess their training period with the tutor.\r\n     \r\n\r\n        Long-term benefits are numerous:\r\n\r\n        1 - Our school has become more attractive and is better known thanks to the activities linked to the mobility program. For example we have recently updated our school website to inform about the \"classe euro et sa mobilit\u00e9\",the Journal de Savigny has  published and will publish an article. The school \"Open Day\", the French families feedback, the meetings with all the members of the school and the students of the mobility, the graduation ceremony, the meetings with the alumni who tell about their professional and personal experience, play a large part in the widening of our school.\r\n\r\n       Our regular contact with the CEI,  already very well-known and specialized in jobs and internships placements, and accommodation for individuals and groups ,  also helps us be more influential in the future.\r\n\r\n         2 - Our voc. school students  in higher education\r\n         3 - Our students in the European and International labour market. \r\n         4 - Our link with EPALE and E-twinning\r\n         5 - Our students : citizens of France, of Europe, of the World.", "http://www.cei-work-travel-study.com/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036012_1"]]}}, "6HD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Projet INTENTS - Partenariat Strat\u00e9gique pour la d\u00e9finition de la profession de professeur en arts du cirque et la reconnaissance de ses comp\u00e9tences", "National Centre for Circus Arts", 295624.0, 12, 34, "For the last 40 years, the contemporary circus arts education sector has been evolving towards a professionalization of actors.

To achieve this we will continue cooperating with the vocational schools, the apprentices\u2019 companies, the Chamber of Commerce as well as with the trade unions and professionals\u2019 organisations. To flank the achievement of these goals we aim to strengthen the competences of the professionals working in schools (particularly at the management level), so they can better aid the young learners to enter the European employment more successfully.An overriding objective of the project is to increase the integration of participants with a migrational background, who are young parents or who are disadvantaged learners into the work force.The following are the main activities we will offer the youths mentioned above:- internships abroad for the youths in their fields- project work abroad for the youths on topics related to participants' vocational fields A majority of the participating youths will be from the following fields: clerical occupations, media, hotel, gastronomy, carpenters/joiners.These main activities will supported by the following flanking activities offered to professionals and student teachers in vocational training centers in Berlin: - Advanced and further training abroad with the topic \u201cprofessionalizing the teacher\u2019s acting in the classroom on the European level aiming to better prepare students for the European job market\u201d.- Professional development training for school management staff regarding \u201cstudents with special needs\u201d.- Training for student teachers with the focus on \u201eLearning from the Best in Europe \u2013 enhancing methodical expertise!\u201d- Training for future school management staff: \u201cHow to successfully develop a vocational training school/institution\u201dOur GoEurope mobility network encompasses 30 different partner organizations in 10 EU countries plus Turkey.

As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. The most desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migrational background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development. Furthermore, we intend to create excitement for the European Union in general amongst satisfied participants! All of them can be instrumental in internationalizing their educational institutions.

When teachers use credible, quality data to evaluate  and inform school improvement, they can better approach complex problems, address diversity and support all their students and engage them to increase their performance. To support the teachers and school leaders in acquiring these skills, the DATADRIVE project will review existing literature, practices, frameworks and instruments related to school quality and data use and collect new evidence from practitioners to build a new school quality framework and survey instruments to measure the underlying school quality dimensions as well as a data-driven school improvement framework both that can be accessed on any digital platform.

And, we are talking about universal problem, with millions of such cases across the EU (Barry, 2006). The charges are ranging from minor status offences, such as theft, to such serious crimes such as burglary, robbery, violence, homicide etc. Afterwards, they more often than not face social exclusion and very limited future prospects, which leads them back to crime. \r\n\r\nHow to avoid that? It is socially accepted that youth centre/worker is a good investment if it/he/she diverts at least one youngster from crime. The project \u201cClimb-Over\u201d is just about that: making good use of youth work to prevent teens/youth from making offences, as well as help reintegration of young offenders. In essence, CO aims to create a special programme in which youth workers would include young offenders in their work with youth. \r\n\r\nObjectives to achieve this: 1) identify the most common crimes youth are committing, and look for ways to reduce them; 2) enhance youth\u2019s awareness on the impact of crime on communities and families; 3) re-integrate young offenders faster by involving them in youth work; 4) prevent young offenders from re-offending; 5) raise the qualifications and competences of youth workers, who could work together with young offenders; 6) spread tolerance and mutual understanding between young offenders and non-offenders. \r\n\r\nNaturally, the main target groups of the project are young offenders, non-offending youth (and youth at risk), youth workers and parents. The number of them to be benefited directly by CO is 2550. However this does not include people that will be reached by continuing dissemination activities and self-sustainable deliverables after the project. \r\n\r\nTo fulfil what is planned, CO will have a total duration of 2 years [from IX 2018 to VIII 2020]. Its activities will take place in Lithuania, United Kingdom and Croatia. These can be grouped into the following: \r\n- Research on the best ways to integrate young offenders & youth at risk into youth work;\r\n- Staff training on how to re-integrate young ex-offenders through youth work;\r\n- Methodology creation on how to include young offenders & youth at risk into youth work, as well as prevent juvenile delinquency;\r\n- Multiplier events to promote the methodology, match young offenders and youth workers and prepare for social integration events; \r\n- Pilot programme that would test the methodology through events for youth in UK, Croatia and Lithuania. \r\n- Online platform creation for re-integration of young ex-offenders through youth work;\r\n- SOcial Shock (SOS) \u2013 youth competition for developing social advertisements aimed at increasing awareness of re-integration of young ex-offenders;\r\n- Creation of social advertisements on youth delinquency;\r\n- Further dissemination & continuation activities. \r\n\r\nAs it is seen from the above, the project will produce a range of tangible results, which are essentially grouped into 2 intellectual outputs: 1) CO methodology to include young offenders into youth work & prevent juvenile delinquency; and (2) Tools for Re-integration of Young Ex-offenders. \r\n\r\nThese products are going to impact the target audiences in all the project countries. Firstly, youth work will be improved by involving young offenders & youth at risk with their skills and experience. This will, in turn, add up to qualifications of the youth workers. Both participating young offenders and youth will also improve skills & competencies, extend their social networks and decrease xenophobia and ghettoism coming from both sides. All of this will have a positive impact on their future careers/life. \r\n\r\nLooking from a purely young offenders\u2019 perspective, they will be able to reintegrate back to society faster. CO\u2019s results will also give more recognition of similar social initiatives aiming to support young (ex-)offenders. Ideally, this could lead to more of those being implemented and, generally, a more accurate public opinion towards ex-convicts. \r\n\r\nPartner organisations have designed the project with self-sustainability in mind.

Recycling of WEEE is a specialist part of the waste and recycling industry. Indeed, waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) such as computers, TV-sets, fridges and cell phones is one the fastest growing waste streams in the EU, with some 9 million tonnes generated in 2005, and expected to grow to more than 12 million tonnes by 2020.WEEE is a complex mixture of materials and components that because of their hazardous content, and if not properly managed, can cause major environmental and health problems. Moreover, the production of modern electronics requires the use of scarce and expensive resources (e.g., around 10% of total gold worldwide is used for their production). To improve the environmental management of WEEE and to contribute to a circular economy and enhance resource efficiency the improvement of collection, treatment and recycling of electronics at the end of their life is essential.The main beneficiaries of the project are young aspiring workers/technicians and entrepreneurs (learners) wishing to work in the weee recycling and reuse management sector, but the project also provides substantial benefits to the organisations working in the circular economy area using VET as a tool to increase employability chances for those learners at the European level.The aim of the EwasteR project has been to emphasise the relationship between waste creation and resource management and to demonstrate the need for skills, competence and experience of entrepreneurs and specialists in devising a solution and/or an appropriate intervention. The project had four concrete key objectives, including:-Overcome the challenges of vocational skills mismatches in the WEEE re-use sector and give supportto it;-Contribute to the development of new solutions in VET system;-Ensure the highest possible relevance for all targets groups and stakeholders involved;-Create new conditions for providing employment and training opportunities and supporting national Qualifications award in the sector with growth potential (green jobs).The future for the practice that has been developed in EwasteR depends on three key factors and these have been the focus of the exploitation strategy. These factors are:-Evidence of the demand for the recognition and validation of new professional qualifications in WEEE recycling and reuse management sector to implement the NQF and RQF of different Countries across Europe;-The development of new European initiatives that enables the development of a strategic sector skills alliance for VET providers and professionals, employers, experts, and stakeholders concerning Circular Economy system and sustainable development across Europe;-The potential to encourage training-exchanging experience across Europe and to work for an effective impact in the VET and labour systems at all levels.", "http://www.lcrn.org.uk", null, "erasmus_554341-EPP-1-2014-1-IT-EPPKA2-SSA_2"], [2014, "Medical Peace Work 3 - Strengthening Health Workers' Performance in Violence Prevention and Peace Building", "Medact", 232916.0, 6, 10, "Health work and peace work can be seen as two aspects of the same objective: Contributing to the wellbeing and prosperity of fellow citizens. Health professionals and their organisations often find themselves in a unique position to prevent or reduce violence and to promote peace. Since 2004, the European Medical Peace Work Partnership has developed training material on peace issues for health professionals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2011, seven Medical Peace Work (MPW) online courses were launched as a self-study option for health professionals. The courses, as well as a web-based resource centre for medical teachers and trainers, are available free of charge at www.medicalpeacework.org. By now, nearly 7.000 users have created an account at the online learning platform, and more than 730 certificates have been issued. The courses are accredited by the Norwegian Medical Association as standalone CME-credited courses (continuous medical education). They have also been applied in medical and health science education at various teaching institutions across Europe. \r\n\r\nFeedback has revealed that self-running online courses require a high level of self-discipline on the part of the students. Albeit a variety of online discussion solutions, individual online students also report a lack of peer contact, which is important to their ability to complete the course and to their practical skills training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith MPW3, we wish to introduce Case-based learning (CBL) as a new teaching methodology. Our consortium of project partners plan to produce twelve new cases that will complement the existing MPW online courses. The new material will focus on skills training in teamwork and problem solving, and it can be used in face-to-face settings or in blended learning solutions when combined with the online courses. It can also be used outside educational institutions and even independently from skilled facilitators; our planned audio-visual case material and new team-focused online course will contain video guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary target group for MPW3 encompasses institutions of higher education and VET for health workers that provide teaching in MPW-related fields of study. Such fields include international health/global health, public health/social medicine, domestic violence prevention, crises prevention/intervention, trauma care, medical ethics & human rights, international humanitarian law, health diplomacy, communication, and conflict management. MPW3\u2019s secondary target group comprises individual health workers and teams of health workers interested in improving their performance in peace building and violence prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur ten partners constitute a combination of the expertise deemed necessary for this project. Organisations such as University of Bergen, IPPNW and Klinikum Nurnberg have extensive Medical Peace practice and education, and they have all formed part of the MPW consortium since 2004. We have also brought in a special organisation with particular expertise in creating and managing case-based learning material \u2013 the UK-based Case Centre. Also contributing to this project are new training institutions and organisations with the type of field and situation practice that will feed into the case development and ensure realistic, high quality scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplier events during the project period include co-organisation of the congress \u2018Medicine and Conscience\u2019, where there will be a special thematic focus on challenging peace-health situations in Europe. A workshop to train health educators in CBL methodology and gain their feedback on our material will be organised further into the project period. Finally, a symposium gathering peace-health educators from Europe and around the world will be held towards the final stages of the MPW3 project period. Dissemination will additionally be ensured through various channels that include our extensive peer networks, lobbying activities, the publication of texts and articles in relevant media, public relations events, MPW information material distributed at conferences, meetings and institutions, as well as accreditation and assimilation of the new CBL material into more health education institutions across Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that MPW3 focuses on case-based learning solutions is a symptom of the MPW network\u2019s eagerness to design sustainable training solutions. CBL comes up as a learning method that caters for the learning capacities and needs of the next generation of students. MPW3 will enable us to bridge the material already produced in MPW 1 and 2 with a methodological approach designed for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical Peace Work as a field of expertise has gradually developed over the past decade. Our network of partners and supporters continues to grow, as does the demand for designated and freely accessible teaching material.

Grassroots sport is a relevant stakeholder: improving volunteers skills could considerably contribute to enrich young athletes personal and social growth, as well as reducing school dropout.The project is thus focused on an innovative aspect: while the link between grassroots sport and social skills is often explored, synergies with the educational dimension and transferability of competences gained through volunteering in sport into formal education is rarely evaluated at European level. Partner organizations want to boost practices of local grassroots sport on education to promote an European impact.PLAY project objective is enhancing positive synergies between volunteering, grassroots sport and education to promote quality educational volunteering to support youngsters at risk of school dropout.The project plans 3 main steps: a first phase of analysis and mapping, a pilot action where partners will develop concrete actions (e-learning through an European platform, educational and mentoring volunteering support in grassroots sport organizations, group activities with parents and trainers), evaluation and assessment of main impact and outputs (handbook, online platform, video) that will be hugely spread through a relevant dissemination.Activities will be developed by 6 partner organizations in 36 months (Jan 2017-Dec 2019) in several European countries (Italy, Finland, Spain, Slovenia, England and Fare Network members countries).", "http://farenet.org", null, "erasmus_579831-EPP-1-2016-2-FI-SPO-SCP_2"], [2016, "The Career Guidance and Modular Training Programme Based on e-Learning Which Is Suitable and Available for Professional Competence of Furnishing", "Global Skills Ledger Limited", 205790.0, 4, 9, "Projemizin Genel Amac\u0131:E\u011fitim ve \u00f6\u011fretim ve i\u015f d\u00fcnyas\u0131 aras\u0131nda i\u015fbirli\u011fi ile \u00d6\u011frenmeyi, istihdam\u0131 ve i\u015f g\u00fcc\u00fc hareketlili\u011fini kolayla\u015ft\u0131rmak i\u00e7in beceri ve yeterliliklerin, \u00f6\u011frenim \u00e7\u0131kt\u0131lar\u0131n\u0131n onaylanmas\u0131 tan\u0131nmas\u0131 ve \u015feffafl\u0131\u011f\u0131n\u0131 sa\u011flayarak ,Dijital \u00e7a\u011fla b\u00fct\u00fcnle\u015ftirilmi\u015f yenilik\u00e7i ve a\u00e7\u0131k e\u011fitim yoluyla Mesleki E\u011fitim M\u00fcfredat\u0131nda anahtar yeterlilikleri daha da g\u00fc\u00e7lendirmektir.Projemizin \u00f6zel ama\u00e7lar\u0131: E\u011fitim ve i\u015f ya\u015fam\u0131n\u0131n i\u015fbirli\u011fine dayal\u0131 olarak,\u201csistematik ve b\u00fct\u00fcnc\u00fcl\u201d bir yakla\u015f\u0131mlaMobilya D\u00f6\u015femecili\u011fi Mesleki Yeterliliklere uygun e\u011fitim m\u00fcfredat\u0131 ve Kariyer geli\u015fimi hizmetleri sunarak \u00f6\u011frencileri i\u015f g\u00fcc\u00fc piyasas\u0131nda istihdam\u0131n\u0131 sa\u011flamak ve Mobilya sekt\u00f6r\u00fcn nitelikli eleman ihtiyac\u0131n\u0131 kar\u015f\u0131lamak.Kurumsal Ar-ge yap\u0131s\u0131 olu\u015fturarak Mesleki E\u011fitimle sekt\u00f6r aras\u0131nda ulus\u00f6tesi i\u015fbirli\u011fine dayal\u0131 , kendi ayaklar\u0131 \u00fczerinde duran bir okul k\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fc olu\u015fturarak kurumsal kapasiteyi geli\u015ftirmek.

According to EMCDDA, there were 1.3 million opioid users in Europe for 2014 alone, among which 30.000 pregnant women and 6,000 users who passed away due to drug use. The main suggested therapies for the drug withdrawal period and relapse prevention are pharmacological, such as the administration of opioid agonists, non-agonists and antagonists. However,  scientific research has shown that these forms of treatment carry a high risk for continued physical dependence and have been found to be insufficient in treating substance dependence without additional treatment. For these reasons different therapeutic modalities have been introduced independently or as an adjunct therapy and have proven to be effective in facilitating detoxification and sustaining abstinence during drug rehabilitation. Music therapy is one of them, as it has gained therapists' interest due to its capacity to have a significantly positive impact on the physical, psychological, mental and social functions of drug addicted individuals. However, despite the scientific evidence concerning the benefits of musical interventions for the treatment of drug addiction, a surprisingly large gap exists in regards to a properly organized network of information dissemination and, more importantly, of professionals' education and training.  \r\nThe aim of the proposed project is the creation of a European-level strategic partnership and know-how exchange network and the preparation, development and implementation of a large-scale training program on the use of music as an complementary therapeutic intervention during the detoxification and rehabilitation processes of individuals suffering from drug dependence. The project's acronym is MUS.I.C.D.A.RE. (MUSic In Creative Detoxification And REhabilitation). The  target population of the project are 210 carers, therapists, psychologists, social workers, volunteers and ex-drug dependent individuals employed or intending to be actively involved or employed in drug detoxification and rehabilitation centers in Europe. Emphasis will be given on balancing transnational and national participants in the training programs, and in attracting ex-drug addicted individuals to participate as trainees. \r\nThe project will consist of the following activities: \r\n1) Exchange of know-how, expertise and best practices among researchers, specialists and practitioners in the specific field of using music as an interventional therapeutic approach in the detoxification and rehabilitation processes of  drug dependent individuals. \r\n2) Design of a unified - accredited - training program  for the aforementioned target group, on the use of music in the detoxification and rehabilitation process of drug dependent individuals, consisting of educating participants on the theoretical principles, research findings but mainly of providing workshop-type learning experiences (experiential learning of principles, methodology and practical applications) through study visits, on-site observations, and 'learning-by-doing'.\r\n3) Creation of the project\u2019s portal.\r\n4) Implementation of the 7-day MUS.I.C.D.A.RE. joint staff training program in the three participating  countries. \r\n5) Development and implementation of the E-course (E-MUS.I.C.D.A.RE.) with participants from across Europe for multiplying effects. \r\n6) Evaluation of the three implementations of the 7-day MUS.I.C.D.A.RE training event and the E-MUS.I.C.D.A.RE course. \r\n7) Creation of an E-book titled \"Handbook of Best Practices: Music in Creative Detoxification and Rehabilitation\".\r\n8) Multiplier Activities: Mid- conference, final conference, closing festival.\r\n9) Dissemination activities throughout the life of the project.\r\n10 Creation of the MUS.I.C.D.A.RE. Network. \r\nThe proposed partnership is expected to offer high quality learning opportunities and expand professional knowledge and skills of  professionals and/or practitioners employed or interested to be employed in detoxification and rehabilitation centers for drug-addicted individuals. It will also bridge the gap between the scientific community, the active field of addiction treatment and the related labor markets via the exchange of significant know-how. This can result in the amelioration of the strategic development, organizational management and quality of learning provision both for scientific experts and the therapeutic personnel of the rehabilitation centers.  Furthermore, this partnership envisions fostering equity, inclusion and high quality targeted activities in education, training and youth in order to promote the personal, social and professional growth and reinsertion of  ex- drug addicted individuals.

The participants would learn and share their good practices/experience through training activities on organising \"Rescued Food for Street Meals\" humanitarian events, cooking, distributing food, etc. This Initiative would support the participants in their personal and professional development (knowledge, skills and attitudes). The project will start on 1st of February 2016 and end on 31th of January 2018.According to UN Report (year 2011), over 1/3 of the world's food for human consumption is being wasted every year. At the same time, worldwide 842 million people are experiencing hunger. Poverty and food insecurity are extremely prevalent in many European cities, making the case for food waste reduction and proper redistribution all the more important. These alarming statistics made us think about how to get actively involved into creating innovative practical solutions for burning problem of food waste. The project deals with the growing global problem of poverty and food-crisis, which is officially stressed by the \u201cFood group\u201d in European Parliament, so we think that this partnership is parallel with their objectives and offers added value in finding the high-quality solutions achievable locally and globally.The objectives of the project are:- to build the capacity of local organisations in each partner country and to deliver projects designed to create a social movement against food waste, - creating a European network of organisations active in youth work, humanitarian work, youth volunteering and healthy lifestyles,- to strengthen the international project capacities of the participating organizations, participating youth workers and volunteers from partner organizations who need to improve their skills and competencies,- to increase the quality of cooperation between civil society and national/regional authorities to promote the development of innovative educational and training systems and their integration in actions of local and regional activity. - to raise public awareness of the great amount of food that is being wasted,- improvement and professionalisation of youth work and key competences/skills of participating youth workers (managerial skills, communication skills, getting new experience at inter-cultural learning, develop practical ICT skills etc.)- to perform a study of existing ICT platforms related to food surplus redistribution and draw best-practices and critical success factors from them.- creation of a methodology to enable youth to develop entrepreneurial solutions to reduce food waste or redistribute food surplus.- Creation of an ICT platform in order to redistribute food surplus form supermarkets, hospitality services, farmers, wholesalemarkets and markets to youth and social organizations. The momentum created by the project will be given long-term sustainability through the new ICT platform on food waste.After the launch of the Intellectual output - Website and Training activities, the partner organisations will hold 5 open-air multiplier public events \"Rescued Food for Street Meals\" in their respective countries aiming to inform the general public, local municipality and interested stakeholders on the food waste problem. On these events general public and stakeholders will be introduced into ideas of active citizenship and volunteering and Intellectual Input and other results of the project will be presented. On each event local organisation will prepare and distribute 1.000 free hot healthy meals (cooked from food that would have been wasted) for socially underprivileged groups. At this events a pilote testing of Rescued Food System Mobile Application will be done. A Training on event management in London will be held, where participating youth workers will receive documents which will professionalize their competences/skills (Youthpass, Europass mobility document).In final months of the project, each organisation will hold a local dissemination event where they will present the project and it's results. On this events local stakeholders (youth NGO's and other educational organizations, interested stakeholders, local municipality) and media will be invited for purpose of further dissemination of the project.", "http://foodforall.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-3-SE02-KA205-001349_4"], [2016, "Ubuntu - Sharing kindness through food", "Food For All", 14234.0, 5, 5, "Ubuntu - Sharing kindness through food is a project involving youth workers from 6 partner organisations throughout Europe: Food for All (UK), Paratlan Ajandek Alapitvany (Hungary), Humanitarno dru\u0161tvo Hrana za \u017eivljenje(Slovenia), Food4Peace Stockholm (Sweden), ISKCON NORGE (Norway).All the organisations are active in youth work, connected with areas of healthy lifestyles, education, youth unemployment and social work.

It was organized to bring as many people as possible to the Conference of Parties, the yearly negotiating space for governments under the United Framework Conference on Climate Change, which was taking place in Warsaw. The train brought together a wide range of organizations, movements and citizens - young and old - and provided a platform for exchange, learning and cooperation. Upon return, leading individuals from the different participating organizations decided to build on the success of the project and start to prepare an even bigger mobilization for the COP21 in Paris 2015. \r\n\r\nThe organization Climate Express (BE) was founded and cooperation was sought with Bizi (FR) and the Campaign against Climate Change (UK) to launch a transnational project titled \u201cMobilizing Citizens for Climate Solutions\u201d. There are close to thirthy young and dynamic individuals leading this project and around hundred volunteers involved. The leaders are coming from a broad range of youth movements and organizations in Belgium, France and the UK and together bring a wide range of skills to the project: leadership and coordination skills, project planning and implementation, campaign design, communication skills, website design, accountancy, fundraising, education skills and working specifically with youth.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are (1) to sensitize and mobilize citizens from Belgium, France and the United Kingdom around the challenges of our generation, specifically climate change; (2) to bring thousands of them physically to the COP21 in Paris; and to (3) showcase the wide range of solutions emerging within civil society, to provide a vision for a just transition.\r\n\r\nThe planned activities fit into three stages. First there will be a decentralized phase in which partners sensitize and mobilize citizens around climate solutions in own countries. This will include a local tour in France and Belgium, on tandem and by train repectively, to visit local communities and engage with citizens. We will further organize an event called \u201cAlternatiba\u201d in at least 30 cities: a village of alternatives to climate change. It aims at gathering different popular and inclusive alternatives to climate change that are already being practiced by the population (regarding such different areas as housing, energy, agriculture and food, etc) in a single, popular and festive event, in order to demonstrate how a more sustainable and fair society can also be a better place to live together. This mobilization phase will be followed by a centralized phase in which collective transport is organized from each country to the COP21 and a joint program is offered during the conference. We want to mobilize at least 12 000 people from the UK and Belgium to join us to Paris. This time we will not only go by train, but also by bus, by bike and on foot to the negotiations! This part of the project will go beyond only the logistics of the transport. Workshops, trainings, citizens\u2019 assemblies, concerts, etc will be organized along the way. We want to bring together social movements, ecological organisations, trade unions, young and old, and excluded groups and focus on what unites us rather than what divides us. During the COP21 we aim for a strong citizens presence, raising their voice, showing that solutions exists and holding governments to account. Finally, after the COP21, there will be another decentralized follow-up phase in the different participating countries, where the results of the COP21 will be discussed at various for and follow-up actions will be planned. A documentary will be made during the project, which will be broadly disseminated upon return from Paris.\r\n\r\nThe aim of our project is to re-activate citizens involvement in this crucial debate which has too often taken place above their heads or is perceived as something that does not affect them directly. We want to bring a positive message. The doom and gloom message around climate change has paralyzed citizens and governments alike. Our focus will be on the opportunity this crisis creates to build a more sustainable and just society.

They are mainly single parents who do not have much leisure time nor opportunities for developing themselves and education. From an early age of their children, they devote their attention and time to them. Repeatedly, they stop socialising or professional development for a longer time. Very often the representatives of this group not only imply their need for developing the skill of narration as a tool to communicate better with their small children, but also participate in such trainings whenever possible. There are, however, several obstacles that they can encounter, i.e. first of all, affordability, time and presence of children during the training. The offer should be tailored exactly to their expectations to enable them to take advantage of it effectively and efficiently.\r\nThe mobility of staff under the project is divided into two steps. The first is adjusted to expectations of educators of Centre for Contemporary Art Ujazdowski Castle and takes the form of  language course through narration based on staff guidelines and assumptions as well as their specific needs. The course of storytelling takes place in Great Britain prepared by Emerson College or Crick Crack Club. Both institutions have had experience in organisation of such trainings. When it comes to guidelines, they will vary from methods or manners of teaching to needs of participants resulting from different experience in the area of working with adults, esp. young children parents. It will deal with both contemporary art and problems it suggests. The course takes place in July 2018 and lasts for a week. The syllabus includes: storytelling in practice, generating appealing stories in exhibition space of e.g. National Gallery or Victoria & Albert Museum in London. Some storytelling takes place in Cubitt Gallery. It is our partner in the second step of mobility.\r\nThe second phase is planned in a form of job shadowing of different educator pairs of Centre for Contemporary Art. It takes place between August \u2013 October, 2018. During it, educators use their better-developed skills of storytelling in practice. They also observe methods of Cubitt Gallery staff in London supporting them. The result of mobility is close insight and evaluation  of educator job profile in Poland nowadays.\r\nThe association of artists-educators and curators working locally and socially in Cubitt Gallery in London is a collective of artists who also work as social workers. Thanks to cultural and art education methods, their aim is to develop audience and to equal their chances through art. Although their activities are mainly artistic, yet combine social matters as well. In this case, the knowledge meets the experience of an artist, educator and social worker all-in-one person which is particularly important for the staff of Centre for Contemporary Art during the second phase. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that such a model is quite rare but also necessary in Poland. The aim of this phase is to introduce such a model in Jazd\u00f3w, in Poland, simply adjusting it to local needs of single parents of young children in Poland.\r\nThird step will be the result of two previous ones. It takes place from January to April in 2019. The aim is to use new skills of storytelling while cooperating with a group of young children single parents. There are several activities for them: workshops, meetings, touring, mini-performances, educational concerts both in an art gallery and in social care houses (single mother houses, community centres).

Participants will also be encouraged to access the OLS course to support the development of their linguistic skills.\r\n\r\nThe mobility project will also benefit BDC staff, enabling them to increase their teaching competences as well as gaining a better understanding of the needs of employers, at European level.", "http://www.reyeurope.org", "Barking & Dagenham College", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-046949_21"], [2017, "International Work Experience for Leicester Colleges VET Learners", "REY Europe Limited", 886086.0, 3, 21, "This project will target learners from three vocational areas within Leicester College:\r\n\r\n- Construction\r\n- Hospitality & Catering\r\n- Travel & Tourism \r\n\r\nWe have identified lead staff within each vocational area, who will recruit, support and prepare their learners to undertake an international mobility placement in Spain or Portugal. This project builds on the success of our previous mobility projects, where we have seen significant impact on our learners, staff and course delivery as a direct result of participation in the mobility. \r\n\r\nThe Mobility project will provide the learners with on-the-job work experience, in a placement that is releavant to their vocational course of study. The skills that learner acquire during their work placement will be transferred back to Leicester college, and we will use the ECVET framework to validate specific units of the learners\u2019 vocational qualification.\r\n\r\nIn addition to gaining sector specific work experience, the learners will have the opportunity to develop their soft skills, such as team working, cross cultural communication and self assurance, in a structured and supportive setting. Each learner will have a line manager at their host organisation and will also be joined by a College tutor, who will act as an Accompanying Person, providing an additional layer of pastoral support to learners. \r\n\r\nThe project will recruit a total of 370 learners, which is a significant upscale of our mobility activity, meaning we can offer opportunities to a much wider range of learners within the College. Our learners are typically aged between 17-19, and many face economic and social barriers. For the majority of learners, this will be their first opportunity to work and and travel abroad, and we have designed our recruitment, preparation and support models to reflect this.\r\n\r\nWe will send 24 flows of learners, in groups of 10-20, to placements in Spain and Portugal over a 24 month period. The project gives us an opportunity to consolidate existing relationships with current host partners and expand our work by developing new partnerships. This will be the first time we are sending learners to Portugal. We have ensured that a process of due diligence has been followed when engaging new partners. We are also enlisting the support of a UK partner, REY Europe, who will support some of the central coordination functions, the project set up and the logistical arrangements. \r\n\r\nThe placements will last for 2-4 weeks, depending on the vocational area and the profile of learners. We consider this timeframe to berealistic and attainable for each group to gain valuable work experience, allowing a sufficient period for learners to adjust to life in a new country as well gain a meaningful experience with the host organisations that will enable them to achieve their specific learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nEach learner will complete a range of tasks within their work placement that are related to their vocational course of study. Our course tutors have selected specific units of their vocational course that can be achieved within the context of the work placement, avoiding the need for classroom duplication on their return. The learning outcomes for each unit will be detailed in an individual learning agreement for each participant, which will also include guidance on how learning should be recorded and evidenced whilst the learner is on placement. The ECVET framework will be used to support this process, with all roles and responsibilities for the host organisation detailed within a memorandum of understanding. The course tutor will meet with each of the host organisations during the first week of the mobility to discuss this process and clarify roles and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe mobility will also provide an opportunity for soft skills development, and learners will be supported to set goals and reflect on their learning in this area. \r\n\r\nWe have seen positive impact on the learners that have been involved in our mobility programming to date, and we hope to build on this through this project. The mobility will provide an opportunity for personal and professional development, and we expect this to impact on our learners by increasing their job readiness and broadening their perspective and aspirations. They will gain sector specific work experience and a new perspective on labour market opportunities. We hope this will motivate, engage and inspire our learners to complete their course of study and progress to further education and/or employment. \r\n\r\nIt is a staff development opportunity for those tutors involved, and it enables us as a College to enhance our course offering, making our courses more attractive to prospective learners and widening the scope of our curriculum.

During the period from 2015-2020 we will work towards targets of increasing our learner job outcome rate from 62% to 70% and maintaining the proportion of learners progressing to further training at 18%, thus achieving an overall positive progression rate of 88% by 2020.Key elements of this work in this area will include incorporating international perspectives within the vocational courses and learner support functions linked to mobility activities, including introducing European dimension to curricula and facilitating international level employability and jobsearch support.  This work is ongoing and will be reflected n this project via the inclusion of a new \u2018European Community Development\u2019 units within our Level 3 Award in Community Development, as well as the introduction of international vacancy bulletins and supported jobsearch services focusing on the community development and energy efficiency sectors in Spain and Italy.We are also working to engage a greater number and range of employers to reflect the needs and aspirations of our learners, with a specific focus on working with larger employers.

We have also developed new 6-month mobilities targeted at learners who are specifically looking to gain employment in a role with an international dimension.  However, we will not be introducing 1-month mobilities as envisaged in our Internationalisation Strategy as the employers we work with expressed a preference for longer mobilities.  We plan to mitigate this by supporting learners with fewer opportunities to undertake work experience in the UK prior to commencing their mobilities to ensure that they have the workplace skills required for their mobility placements.MOBILITY FLOWSThe project will provide a total of 94 mobilities for VET learners, timetabled as follows (compared to 93 envisaged in our Interationalisation Strategy):Sep-Dec 2016: 18 x 3 month mobilities to Spain Jan-Jul 2017: 8 x 6 month mobilities to SpainFeb-May 2017: 7 x 3 month mobilities to ItalyApr-Jul 2017: 18 x 3 month mobilities to SpainSep-Dec: 2017: 18 x 3 month mobilities to SpainJan-Apr 2018: 18 x 3 month mobilities to Spain Feb-May 2018: 7 x 3 month mobilities to ItalyACCOMPANYING PERSONSWe will send a total of 10 Accompanying Persons throughout the project lifetime to reflect the flows of participants and the geographical locations of the work placements. The Accompanying Person will provide pastoral care functions and will be qualified IAG workers fluent in either Spanish or Italian (depending on the destination of the groups they support).  Prior to and during mobilities they will liaise with the participants and their support agencies to identify and respond to any additional needs arising as a result of the undertaking the mobility, e.g. anxiety about living away from home or practical issues such as accommodation and housing support functions. Thus they will be able to support participants with difficult situations, for example lost passport, medical issues, etc, and will be able to liaise with local services and translate where necessary.The Accompanying Persons will also ensure lines of communication between participants, DSC Regen and the Host Employers remain open throughout the mobilities and also provide aftercare to ensure continuation of and reintegration with support functions on return to the UK.  Thus the roles of the Accompanying Persons will complement support and monitoring functions measures to assist all participants and, in particular, to ensure that learners from disadvantaged backgrounds have equal access to the opportunities provided and are not disadvantaged in any way before, during or after their mobility.", "http://www.dscregen.co.uk", "DSC Regen Ltd", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA116-023725_coordinator"], [2018, "Bath College European Work Experience for Vocational Learners", "REY Europe Limited", 537213.0, 4, 39, "This is a 2 year project, during which time we plan to send 172 learners on vocational placements in Seville, Crete and Prague. Placements will be 3-6 weeks long, with the exact length of stay determined by the lead tutor for each vocational area. We feel this is sufficient time for students to adjust to work and life in another country, meaningfully gain from the experience and achieve tangible learning outcomes. The destination for each student will be determined by their vocational area and the placements available. Students will be selected from the following departments: Business, Beauty, Travel & Tourism, Sport (Football), Catering and Computing. \r\n\r\nOur project objectives are \r\n- to provide European work placement opportunities to students across a range of vocational sectors\r\n- to build on the success of our 2016 mobility project, develop our internal project delivery capacity, and expand our work to offer more students international opportunities\r\n- to enable students to apply the theoretical learning acquired on their course in a structured and sector specific work setting \r\n- to enable students to develop soft skills & professional competences \r\n- to show them different perspectives & practices in a work setting. To promote cross-cultural working and ultimately, broaden their horizons \r\n\r\nWe aim to make our students highly employable and enterprising by developing the skills employers want. The project will enhance our students' learning experience and increase their employability. \r\n\r\nThe placements are framed by a supportive pre, during & post placement structure, with group training and individual support offered in order to fully prepare students for the placement, and provide a debrief and careers guidance on how to maximize their learning on their return.\r\n\r\nThe models of support that we offer our learners will be tailored to their individual needs, recognising that support needs will differ between participants and at different points in the project. Each group will be joined by an accompanying staff member from the College and will have a designated placement supervisor, as well as local partner support. \r\n\r\nThe participants for this mobility will all be students at Bath College, studying  up to Level 3 in one of the following vocational areas: Beauty (Level 3), Business (Level 3), Catering (Level 2), Computing (Level 3), Football (Level 3) Travel & Tourism (Level 3).\r\n\r\nOur tutors have strong existing relationships with learners and a good working knowledge of how best to engage and retain them, and design a project that is responsive to their needs. \r\n\r\nLearner needs are: \r\n\r\n- To gain sector specific practical work experience and apply the technical skills and theoretical knowledge they have acquired through their course in a practical setting\r\n- To develop their soft skills (such as self assurance, adaptability, communication) and their language competences\r\n- To provide participants with international experience, pushing them out of their comfort zone in a supportive environment\r\n\r\nUltimately we hope this will put them in a stronger position to gain employment in the sector on completion of their course. In order to have a competitive edge in the labour market, we know that students need to develop personal competences such as team work, confidence and adaptability. We hope the mobility will increase their aspirations for a career in the sector.\r\n\r\nLearners will develop the confidence to interact in a foreign language setting, an understanding of the sector at European level & insight in to how organisations operate in a different cultural context. In the long term, we hope the mobility will contribute to positive onward progression and raised aspirations amongst our learners. The mobility provides a structured employment experience, with a line manager and a clear set of tasks and guidance, support learners to engage in a 'real' work setting and develop realistic expectations of the working world. \r\n\r\nThe mobility placement will be explicitly linked to learners' course of study.

Each departure will recruit a cohort of 14 students who will spend 8 weeks in their overseas placements. \r\n\r\nThe mobility will take place in Spain, and participants will be hosted in Seville, Andalucia.Sstudents will be placed in small groups in work placements in Seville. Placements are all local tourist operations, and through the placements, students will gain first hand customer service and hospitality experience and develop their confidence working in a cross cultural environment. \r\n\r\nStudents will receive 2 days of face to face training in the UK prior to departure and an in-country orientation by a REY Europe representative who will be based in Seville throughout the mobility to ensure that there is full pastoral support for participants.

These will be defined within the context of the ECVET framework.  They will be supported in-country by a line manager within the placement, who will conduct regular review meetings with participants to chart their progress and will sign off their learning agreement at the end of the mobility if learning outcomes have been achieved. The agreements will then be returned to their college tutor will award the appropriate unit of their BTEC qualification. \r\n\r\nThe intended impact of this mobility is that students will gain first hand work experience, intercultural experience and personal development that will strengthen their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.

We recognise the value of investing in young people who are currently training to enter the hospitality sector, as it has been identified as a growth area and therefore through supporting young people to better equip themselves for a career in the sector, we hope to contribute to the reduction of youth unemployment in the UK.\r\nThe participants for this project will be young people (18 - 19 yr olds) who are studying for their Professional Cookery NVQ. Their NVQ will equip them with the technical skills and theoretical knowledge that they need for a career in the sector. To enhance their qualification, and put them in the best position for gaining employment in the sector upon completion of their course, they need to gain sector specific practical work experience, increase their soft skills and develop their language competences.\r\n108 participants will be recruited over a 24 month period from 3 vocational colleges in the UK, who will work together as a consortium. Participants will travel in groups of 18 to undertake a 6 week placement in a range of relevant host companies based in Seville, Spain.\r\nThe majority of participants will not have undertaken an overseas work placement before. Therefore 6 weeks is a realistic and attainable timeframe for the group. It is sufficient time for the participants to adjust to work and life in a foreign country, meaningfully gain from the experience and achieve a set of individual learning objectives in a structured and supportive environment. Participants will be joined by an accompanying person from each college.\r\nDuring their placement, participants will work in kitchens completing food preparation, cooking and completion which will correspond to the mandatory units of their NVQ, covering topics such as food hygiene & safety and cooking new dishes. They will learn how to work in a fast-paced, pressurised environment and how to work effectively in a team. \r\nAt the start of the placement, project staff will support participants to agree a set of Learning Outcomes for the mobility which will reflect the course units that relate to the specific tasks that the participants will complete during their  placement. \r\nParticipants will receive pre-departure and in-country training to prepare them for the mobility and will have regular and structured supervision during the placement, to provide pastoral support and ensure they are making progress towards their Learning Outcomes and developing their personal objectives. \r\nREY Europe will form a consortium with the sending partners to design, deliver, evaluate and disseminate the project.

The longer term impact is for participants to secure meaningful employment in the sector. As well as developing professional skills in the kitchen, learners will benefit from an intercultural experience, increased language competency and personal development. This will strengthen their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness and instil in them a broader perspective and international outlook when seeking employment.\r\nThe project will positively impact the Sending partners by enabling them to provide a rounded NVQ experience for their learners.

The project also aims to enable to participants to develop the linguistic and cultural skills required to access employment in other countries within the European labour market.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThe project will provide mobilities to Spain for VET learners in the Energy Efficiency sector that will incorporate work placements hosted by partner employers that can offer both domestic and commercial energy assessment work covering a range of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy technologies. This will enable the project to respond to the specific aspirations of each participant by providing them with a placement that matches their learning and work experience needs.  \r\n\r\nThe project will also provide mobilities to Italy and Spain for VET learners in the Community Development sector that will incorporate work placements with employers that undertake community development work in the destination countries but that also have a transnational dimension to their work.  \r\n\r\nSupporting participants to develop the linguistic and cultural skills required to access employment in other countries within the European labour market is also a key project objective.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nParticipants will be VET learners who are working towards or who have recently completed vocational qualifications for the Energy Efficiency and Community Development sectors. Although we offer a range of qualifications for these sectors, the specific courses where we propose to offer mobility opportunities to learners are the Certificate in Understanding Sustainable Energy Efficiency at either Level 2 or Level 3 and the Award in Community Development at Level 3. In total, 62 participants will undertake 3-month mobilities - 50 to Spain and 12 to Italy.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nThe main activities undertaken by participants during their mobilities will be the programme of work experience and learning facilitated by their Host Employer in either the Energy Efficiency or Community Development sector. This will vary for individual participants but participants will be matched with an appropriate Host Employer in accordance with their learning needs and professional development aims. Participants will gain experience in a range of areas and core work experience and learning programmes will also be complemented by preparation, orientation and induction activities, ongoing language support and a programme of social and cultural activities.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nProject methodologies focus on supporting learners to develop experience-acquired skills for their vocational area and learn by working alongside established professionals in their chosen field. We have worked with the project partners on previous, successful Mobility Projects and have well-established methodologies and mechanisms for supporting the training objectives and professional development aspirations of participants from the relevant target groups.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nThe project will also provide significant beneficial impacts for the participants in terms of labour market integration and career development. Based on our experience of delivering successful Mobility Projects, we expect at least two thirds of participants (42 out of 62) to move into sustainable employment in their chosen field after completing their Mobility Placement, with a further 20% (12 out of 62) progressing onto further training for either the Energy Efficiency or Community Development sectors.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nThe project will help to build the capacity of partners to participate in transnational activities and European projects in general and the Erasmus Plus programme in particular. The project partners will also work to respond to relevant policies and initiatives. For example, the focus on Energy Efficiency is in line with the European Union\u2019s recently adopted targets of reducing greenhouse gases by 40% compared to 1990 levels and producing 27% of energy from renewable sources by 2030.  Similarly, providing Community Development training and mobility opportunities will enable the project to respond to the focus of the Europe for Citizens programme on encouraging citizens to become actively involved in the process of European integration.\r\n\r\nLONGER TERM BENEFITS\r\nOver the medium to long term, evaluation and dissemination activities offer potential to engage with VET providers and enterprises within Energy Efficiency and Community Development sectors more widely across the EU and thus inform developments in VET provision at the local, national and European level.", "http://www.dscregen.co.uk", "DSC Regen Ltd", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012918_coordinator"], [2014, "E.M.

The placements are all local tourist focussed organisations whose daily activities involve arranging and delivering a variety of small to medium sized events, predominantly targeting holidaymakers and corporate events, but also includes some that are focussed towards the local community.\r\nThe work placements will provide the learners with first hand  experience of the process of organising events within a company. The events are varied and as well as understanding operational planning, event set up/breakdown, health & safety requirements etc. the learners will also gain customer service experience and develop their confidence working in a cross cultural environment. \r\n\r\nStudents will receive 2 days of face to face training in the UK prior to their departure; once abroad the learners will receive an in-country orientation by a REY Europe representative who will be based in Tenerife throughout the Mobility to ensure that there is full pastoral support available to help with any learner needs. An Accompanying Person form the partner VET colleges will also stay with the group for the first 5 days of the Mobility. \r\nPrior to the Mobility, learners will be supported to develop an individual Learning Agreement and a set of Learning Outcomes, which will be shaped by the job description that they have been given by their placement host. These will be defined within the context of the ECVET framework.  The learners will be supported in-country by a line manager within the placement, who will conduct regular review meetings with the learners to chart their progress; the line manager will verify the achievement of Learning Outcomes that have been achieved during the Mobility and will demonstrate these within a Europass Mobility certificate. \r\n\r\nThe intended impact of this mobility is that students will gain first hand work experience, intercultural experience and personal\r\ndevelopment that will strengthen their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.  It is hoped that the students will develop personal and professional confidence, an understanding of the European labour market and a set of transferable skills that will better prepare them for employment, giving them a competitive edge when seeking employment and an international outlook. \r\nIn the short term, this will be evident through the successful completion of Learning Outcomes. We also plan to monitor and evaluate the impact of the mobility of the longer term by looking at participants future career pathways and how the mobility has supported their progression to employment. \r\nThe anticipated impact for participating organisations is that their European networks and international outlook will be developed and strengthened, so that they are able to offer similar opportunities to future students and are more engaged and connected to the European labour market.", "http://www.reyeurope.org", "REY Europe Limited", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA102-012225_coordinator"], [2014, "Energy Efficiency and Community Development Mobility Project", "DSC Regen Ltd", 270900.0, 3, 6, "CONTEXT\r\n\r\nThe primary rationale for the project is to support VET learners in the Energy Efficiency and Community Development sectors in developing vocational skills and gaining work experience to maximise their opportunities for labour market integration and career progression.  The project also aims to enable to participants to develop the linguistic and cultural skills required to access employment in other countries within the European labour market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe project will provide mobilities to Spain for VET learners in the Energy Efficiency sector that will incorporate work placements hosted by partner employers that can offer both domestic and commercial energy assessment work covering a range of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy technologies.  This will enable the project to respond to the specific aspirations of each participant by providing them with a placement that matches their learning and work experience needs.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will also provide mobilities to Italy and Spain for VET learners in the Community Development sector that will incorporate work placements with employers that undertake community development work in the destination countries but that also have a transnational dimension to their work.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupporting participants to develop the linguistic and cultural skills required to access employment in other countries within the European labour market is also a key project objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nParticipants will be VET learners who are working towards or who have recently completed vocational qualifications for the Energy Efficiency and Community Development sectors. Although we offer a range of qualifications for these sectors, the specific courses where we propose to offer mobility opportunities to learners are the Certificate in Understanding Sustainable Energy Efficiency at either Level 2 or Level 3 and the Award in Community Development at Level 3.  45 participant will undertake 3-month mobilities (36 to Spain and 9 to Italy) and 12 participants will undertake 1-month mobilities (9 to Spain and 3 to Italy).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe main activities undertaken by participants during their mobilities will be the programme of work experience and learning facilitated by their Host Employer in either the Energy Efficiency or Community Development sector.  This will vary for individual participants but participants will be matched with an appropriate Host Employer in accordance with their learning needs and professional development aims.  Participants accessing 3-month mobilities will gain experience in a range of areas whereas those accessing 1-month mobilities will focus on specific activities.  Core work experience and learning programmes will also be complemented by preparation, orientation and induction activities, ongoing language support and a programme of social and cultural activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\n\r\nProject methodologies focus on supporting learners to develop experience-acquired skills for their vocational area and learn by working alongside established professionals in their chosen field.  We have worked with the project partners on previous, successful Mobility Projects and have well-established methodologies and mechanisms for supporting the training objectives and professional development aspirations of participants from the relevant target groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nThe project will also provide significant beneficial impacts for the participants in terms of labour market integration and career development.  Based on our experience of delivering successful Mobility Projects, we expect at least two thirds of participants (38 out of 57) to move into sustainable employment in their chosen field after completing their Mobility Placement, with a further 20% (11 out of 57) progressing onto further training for either the Energy Efficiency or Community Development sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\n\r\nThe project will help to build the capacity of partners to participate in transnational activities and European projects in general and the Erasmus Plus programme in particular.  The project partners will also work to respond to relevant policies and initiatives. For example, the focus on Energy Efficiency is in line with the European Union\u2019s recently adopted targets of reducing greenhouse gases by 40% compared to 1990 levels and producing 27% of energy from renewable sources by 2030.  Similarly, providing Community Development training and mobility opportunities will enable the project to respond to the focus of the Europe for Citizens programme on encouraging citizens to become actively involved in the process of European integration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGER TERM BENEFITS\r\n\r\nOver the medium to long term, evaluation and dissemination activities offer potential to engage with VET providers and enterprises within Energy Efficiency and Community Development sectors more widely across the EU and thus inform developments in VET provision at the local, national and European level.", "http://www.dscregen.co.uk", "DSC Regen Ltd", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000556_coordinator"], [2017, "Understanding my Journey: Supporting Soft Skills Development for Young People", "REY Europe Limited", 211457.0, 8, 8, "This project will produce a set of outputs that will support young people to recognise and reflect upon their soft skills development more effectively, once they have completed a mobility or youth employability focussed initiative.\r\n\r\nMany young people feel that after completing a work placement or other similar experience, they have progressed both personally and professionally, yet often struggle to clearly identify the specific ways in which they have grown or identify the exact ways in which they feel that their employability has increased, using practical and tangible examples of soft skills development.\r\n\r\nWe have selected a diverse range of partners, in terms of profile and target group, in order to collaborate and develop tools that can be applied within different contexts. Project partners all offer opportunities to young people to develop their skills and better equip themselves for employment in the future, through a range of interventions, including mobility, training, volunteering and entrepreneurship programmes. \r\n\r\nOur aim is to develop tools that will support young people, and their practitioners, to ensure these initiatives have maximum impact in terms of soft skills development that can be quantified and built upon.\r\n\r\nOur project objectives are: \r\n- to improve young peoples engagement with and ownership of their soft skills development\r\n- to increase young people's employability \r\n- to raise awareness of the importance of soft skills development \r\n\r\nTo achieve this we will:\r\n-- Identify the most important and relevant soft skills for young people, in terms of personal and professional development.\r\n- Gain an insight into existing good practice in supporting young people to recognise achievement in relation to soft skills \r\n- Develop a toolkit that will guide young people to assess their achievements in terms of soft skills development and support them to recognise and articulate progress. \r\n- To provide guidance for practitioners working with young people to support them to integrate the toolkit and ensure that young people are empowered to take ownership of their soft skills development.\r\n\r\nWe will be working in a consortium of 8 pan European partners, over 36 months, to develop the following outputs: \r\n\r\nIO 1: A piece of research to identify the most important and relevant soft skills for young people, in terms of their personal and professional development. The research will be identify key soft skills, and highlight examples of good practice, in terms of interventions that support soft skills development in young people.  \r\n\r\nIO 2: A toolkit that will guide young people to reflect on distance traveled and assess their achievements in terms of soft skills development. The tools will support users to recognise and articulate their progress, using tangible examples of where they have demonstrated strength. The tools will be designed so that they are relevant and accessible to a range of young people.\r\n\r\nIO 3: An web based application that will complement the toolkit, providing an interactive platform for young people to capture their soft skills development journey. The app will link to photos and other media files, in order to offer alternatives to a written evidencing process, using a format that is exciting and engaging to young people. \r\n\r\nIO 4: A practitioner\u2019s guide which will support those working with young people to introduce the toolkit (IO 2) and app (IO 3), ensure it is used effectively and is integrated into the youth activities that the young people will be involved. \r\n\r\nWe will have 6 transnational meetings to collaborate on the development of our outputs. The tools will all be piloted in our partner countries before they are finalised. We have a clear dissemination strategy in place to share our tools with youth practitioners and young people across all partner countries and more widely at European level.

Our target group is vocational learners, studying qualifications up to level 3. Most learners are young people who may not have travelled/studied abroad previously.Through national mapping activities, we will gain an insight into approaches to validating work based (WB) learning in different European contexts and understand the challenges/barriers faced by the key actors within mobility activity, in terms of their engagement with ECVET. In response to our findings, we will develop six intellectual outputs (IOs), through which we will offer innovative approaches to supporting the key actors to better engage with the ECVET process and understand how their roles are interlinked. IOs will be led by different partners, according to the topic and their own area of expertise. A corresponding transnational meeting will be hosted by the partner leading the specific IO.We will develop resources for each stakeholder group, to support the implementation of ECVET and the achievement of credit bearing LOs. Resources will be accessible and user friendly, in order to demystify the implementation of ECVET and encourage active engagement with the framework. We intend for the materials produced to be used in a range of European contexts.We expect 1360 participants to be indirectly impacted by the project itself. This can be broken down into three key stakeholder groups, learners, vocational college tutors, and host organisation mentors.We will carry out a pilot mobility activity to provide an opportunity to test the resources developed as well as gathering feedback from other stakeholders at national level. The results we expect to see are:>The development of an approach to break down the perceived barriers to using ECVET by simplifying the approach to evidencing learning outcomes.> Stronger integration of WB mobility opportunities into vocational curricula> Improved learner mobility experience> Improved cultural awareness of staff, and increased international staff development opportunities> Increased awareness of mobility activity as a credit bearing course component amongst national accrediting bodies.By directly engaging national accrediting bodies we hope to raise their awareness of mobility activity as a viable learning opportunity that will be credit bearing for learners. We will also examine how the national accrediting bodies correspond to the European Qualifications Framework (EQF). The results we expect to see will all contribute to the overall anticipated impact: - Improved quality of WB mobility opportunities- Improved use of European reference tools (ECVET) for recognition, validation & transparency of competencies & qualifications - Increased use of learning outcomes when describing and defining qualifications and validating WB mobility learningThis project will produce, a model for the validation and recognition for WB learning within mobility activity that is clear, accessible and deliverable across multiple EU countries and in alignment with the parameters defined by a range of accrediting organisations. We expect this to lead to a more cohesive transnational framework and formal recognition of WB learning opportunities, which will increase the portability of national accreditation. By achieving greater recognition of work based mobility placements as a viable and enhancing component of a vocational course, we see the potential for impact amongst all stakeholders involved; vocational colleges, we expect to see  stronger integration of mobility activity as part of their wider internationalisation/course enhancement strategy. Learners will be encouraged and better supported to broaden their horizons and access the European labour market, and to be able to demonstrate a set of key skills and expertise through a widely recognised framework. We expect the project to lead to improved access to WB learning opportunities that are formally validated by the learning institution and their accrediting body, and an increase in the number of validated WB learning opportunities taken up by students. Through dissemination actitvities, we will ensure the impact of project is far reaching, to ensure the results are useful and utilised by organisations, and countries, beyond our immediate networks.

The project is designed in the context out bonded by 2 Region in the South of Italy, Calabria and Campania. In fact, some analysis conducted on this sector, even though indicating clearly a low and inadequate investment in new technologies, showed a good growth in terms of employment opportunities. Furthermore,the complex and critical situation of the labor market in the Calabria and Campania region, together with the geographical position, that looks isolated from the rest of Europe, indicates that the transnational mobility actions are largely needed especially for young Learners. They have, in fact,few opportunities to get experience, or sometimes they don\u2019t have opportunities at all, and  then they can\u2019t make comparison with other European companies during their training path.Moreover, the lack of experience in the company reduces the possibility of entering the labor market.

The mobility will provide an opportunity to apply their theoretical classroom learning in a real life work setting. \r\n\r\nOur aim is to create an experience for the students that will enhance their overall programme of study. The project will support this by giving the students the opportunity to live and work in another country whereby they can adapt their social skills when dealing with a new culture and language. \r\n\r\nAt present, we are able to offer work placements to students in the local area, but we recognise the value that an international dimension will bring. It will encourage learners to become more independent, develop their confidence, self assurance and other key skills in a structured and supportive setting.\r\n\r\nFor many of our learners, this will be their first experience of travel outside the UK or even their home community. In the context of their vocational course, travel & tourism, it is vital that they have some international experience, of working and communicating with people in a different language and culture. The mobility is a chance to offer learners this experience, in an environment of close staff and peer supervision and support. This will put them in a much stronger position to access employment in the sector, and equip them with a broader perspective of the opportunities available to them. \r\n\r\nThe mobility will give our learners a broad understanding of different types of travel and tourism organisations within two popular tourist locations. \r\n\r\nWe have support mechanisms in place to support our young learners through the accompanying person role, work placement supervisors, and local reps in each host location. We will also design in depth preparatory activities, and schedule parents evenings and info events prior to departure. \r\n\r\nWe will agree a set of learning outcomes for each learner, which will be aligned to specific units of their vocational course. they will also have personal learning objectives.

Increasing customer expectations are driving the need for improved customer service skills and a capable, confident and experienced workforce must be developed to respond to this demand. The learners will work in tourist businesses undertaking activities which will correspond to the mandatory units of their NVQ, so that they can continue to gain course credits whilst on placement.Participants will be based in a tourist businesses, in a range of customer facing roles. They will be involved in activities such as working on reception, arranging excursions and marketing tourist activities in established businesses including a tour company, 5* hotel and a museum. Through structured overseas work placements in a range of established tourist businesses, participants will gain a vital insight into international work in the sector. They will have the opportunity to develop their practical skills, increase their vocational knowledge and acquire industry specific competencies. They will be supported to develop soft skills, such as communication, team work, cultural awareness and customer service ethic. In addition to their professional and personal development, the project will offer language training to increase participants' competency in Spanish. We will work with host organisations to identify suitable Learning Outcomes that are realistic and attainable for the participants and relevant to both the host partner and the NVQ that participants are studying. \r\n\r\nWe plan to target participants who have not previously had opportunities to work or study abroad. We have identified host partners in a range of tourist organisations in Seville who have extensive experience of providing internship opportunities. Through a systematic partnership development process we will work collaboratively to ensure that the placement provides a structured and supportive setting, and that we able to confidently offer the mobility opportunity to those who are less self assured and lacking experience of overseas travel. This is a unique opportunity for these individuals to gain a broader perspective of work in the sector and a strengthened sense of international identity and an understanding of their position in the EU labour market.

In addition, volunteering is a significantly relevant platform for informal and non-formal learning of various groups of society, thanks to its inherent mechanisms for peer-to-peer collaboration and knowledge sharing. At the same time, volunteering is a unique platform for intergenerational learning, as it promotes mutual understanding and learning between elderly and youth. Ultimately, volunteering triggers positive spill-over in European economy and society as a unique mechanism for greater social inclusion not only for the beneficiaries of volunteering services but also for the volunteers. This is even more important when volunteering is considered as a pivot for intergenerational linkages, as a means to promote social inclusion of an ageing population and active citizenship of the young part of society.\r\n\r\nYet, many capacity constraints undermine the efficacy and impact of volunteering as a whole: volunteering organisations seldom have the right set of managerial skills to maximize the impact of their activities.
