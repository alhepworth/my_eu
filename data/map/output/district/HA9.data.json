Secondly, educational under-achievement most often leads to social exclusion and multi-faceted disadvantage and in a small number of cases young adolescents on the margins of society and economy are being attracted to extremist groups enticed by the false promises of extremist ideologies. The economic, political, technological and cultural transformation of the past decade has undoubtedly influenced and aided the development of these worrying trends. The overall aim of the project is to find ways of fostering and strengthening the understanding of difference and diversity in the youth of our European societies by sharing experiences, ideas and practices of migration issues, discussing and debating the benefits of migration, diversity and multiculturalism.  Project participants will have the opportunity to look critically at the issue of migration by not only focusing on the last wave which is currently happening in Europe but look in a more wider context, at the same time through discussion and debate be able to relate it to multiculturalism and diversity already existing in Europe.\r\n\r\nObjectives are: \r\n1.  Increase youth self-esteem and motivation for an active participation in their organizations and in society valuing their perspectives and enhancing their inner and relational skills \r\n2. Provide young people with communication and public opinion formation skills helping to incorporate European values and Citizenship. \r\n3. Equip young people with enhanced life skills and world knowledge will contribute to their democratic resilience. \r\n4. To encourage dialogue between young people and decision makers in all policy fields, specifically in the area of youth policy\r\n5. To contribute towards revitalizing democracy in Europe and increase youth participation on a local, regional, national and European level\r\n\r\nProfile of Participants\r\n\r\nThe target group are from disadvantaged youngsters from refugee communities in the participating EU countries and living in vulnerable urban areas of large EU cities. They have a low standard of living and socially low-income families. They are refugees living in double cultures (culture of origin and culture of the new society) and, are increasingly feeling isolated and detached from the mainstream society.  Majority of young people have limited social skills or anti-social or risky sexual behaviours, young people in a precarious situation, (ex )offenders, (ex )drug or alcohol abusers, young and/or single parents, orphans, young people from broken families, \r\n\r\nDescription of Activities\r\n\r\nThe Project will bring together 46 participants especially between the ages of 16-30 from 4 countries (UK, Sweden, Netherland and Finland )  for 10 days of activities including seminars, workshops and discussion based on meetings between young people from participating countries. \r\n\r\nNon-Formal Learning: \r\nThe project will provide young people, the space to interact, debate and ask questions during the entire process. This will give them the opportunity to learn in an environment where their assertions will be challenged in a gentle way while ensuring they can receive information in different channels (debate, one-to-one, presentation) that can suit the informal learning styles of all the young people. \r\n\r\nImpact\r\n\r\nThe project will counter and prevent prejudice and extremist thinking by reflecting on shared values and ideas of how we want to live together and by showing possibilities and means of democratic participation and provide youth workers, both volunteers and employed, with training opportunities for specialisation at this level of prevention. By equipping young people with enhanced life skills and world knowledge will contribute to their democratic resilience and thus strengthen democratic values is a strong aspect of the project activities as it will empower young people to be able to make their own choices and value judgements. The project will increase the self-esteem, confidence and motivation of young people to get involved in local community activities and participate more in local society. The project will promote tolerance, respect, appreciation and development of a multicultural society and will enable participants to cultivate the necessary values such as equality, human dignity will help create a culture of human rights.
