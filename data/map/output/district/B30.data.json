The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.  It is also important to maintain the interest for internationalization at the schools where projects already exist.  \r\n\u2022 Increase the language competence and the interest in foreign languages, for head teachers, teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nIn our project there are eight head teachers and three deputy head teachers from the schools G\u00f6kstensskolan, Hammarg\u00e4rdets skola, \u00c4rstaskolan, Tegelviken, Bj\u00f6rktorpsskolan, Skiftingehus, Fr\u00f6slundaskolan och St\u00e5lforsskolan. All of them will do job shadowing activities in Birmingham, where they will have the opportunity to get inspiration and and ideas which will help them in their strategic quality development of their schools.  They will also be able to establish contacts for international collaboration for head teachers, teachers and pupils.   Furthermore, the job shadowing gives them a chance to improve their English, which will be valuable in their future collaboration.  For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and these job shadowing activities are part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe head teachers (all but one) will also take a course in order to learn more about Erasmus+ and how it can be effective in the strategic development of the school and in the collaboration with teachers and pupils from other countries.  They will learn how to anchor Erasmus+ in the work of the organization and use it as a tool.  The course also gives them a good opportunity to meet others and make connections for future KA1 and KA2 projects, as well as an opportunity to improve their language ability.  \r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the activities will lead to more schools in Eskilstuna having international projects and international collaboration.  Moreover, these projects are expected to lead to increased language ability among head teachers, teachers and pupils, to increased tolerance and understanding of different cultures and to make the pupils prepared for an international labor market.", "http://www.stjosb30.bham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038787_15"]]}}, "3ES": {"cordis": {"data": [[1441065600000, 1567209600000, "Secure Management Platform for Shared Process Resources", "International Synergies Ltd", "To pave the way forward for IS as a solution for more efficient processing and energy systems for the\nprocess industry, we will develop a secure ICT platform (SHAREBOX) for the flexible management of \nshared process resources that will provide plant operations and production managers with the \nrobust and reliable information that they need in real-time in order to effectively and confidently \nshare resources (plant, energy, water, residues, and recycled materials) with other companies in a \nsymbiotic eco-system. \n\nA suite of new analysis and optimisation tools for flexible energy use and material flow integration \nwill be developed for optimising symbiosis among companies.

Yet, for all its dynamism, the sector is also becoming more crowded and ambitious young entrepreneurs are looking upwards and outwards for further growth opportunities.  Viable paths to expansion include moving to fixed premises, manufacturing value added products for retail and franchising mobile units. By growing this way, street food entrepreneurs are able to create more resilient businesses with higher employment and turnover.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, today\u2019s street food entrepreneurs tend to be young, first time business owners and although they have developed useful skills they are often self-taught and lack formal enterprise education. Hence there is a clear argument for providing timely, tailored business training enabling them to overcome the strategic and operational challenges of scaling up. \r\n\r\nThen again, unless food entrepreneurs work in a region conducive to innovation and strategic food marketing, their efforts will be truncated.  Collective action is required: local authorities and economic development stakeholders must also grasp the potential of the street food movement to evolve into a vibrant regional food scene based on high quality, local produce, accessibility and authenticity. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Street Food: Opportunities for Regions aims to deliver high training for street food entrepreneurs to grow their businesses, at the same time as it works with HEIs and business development organizations that provide VET for the food sector, and wider economic development stakeholders to harness food SMEs as a driver of regional growth.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we will: \r\na) Engage 50- 60 high level stakeholder organizations in 5 Regional Alliances. Together they will \r\nstudy the evolution of the street food phenomenon, devise and implement 5 Regional Action Plans to boost the growth of innovative food entrepreneurs and their contribution to economic development and tourism at regional level. \r\nb) Publish a \u201cStreet Food: Opportunities for Regions\u201d Toolkit to facilitate the replication of Regional Alliances of this nature across Europe.\r\nc) Create Street Food Success: What\u2019s Next? a course curriculum and learning materials to help street food entrepreneurs grow their businesses successfully\r\nd) Trial the course with at least 50 street food entrepreneurs in participating countries, and 25 VET trainers, then publish the course, and engage in dissemination activities and events to facilitate its inclusion in mainstream VET provision.\r\n\r\nStreet Food: Opportunities for Regions has been carefully structured to generate impact for current street food entrepreneurs and the VET providers who serve them, as well as creating wider benefits for the HEI-VET community and overall regional economic development. \r\n\r\nAt individual level, street food entrepreneurs who take the course are more likely to grow their businesses, moving into new markets and products with greater confidence and skills for success.  Micro and small enterprises form the cornerstone of local communities and economies and so their success will contribute to a strong local food sector that is an integral part of a healthy and affordable economy.\r\n\r\nAt organizational level, VET providers, especially enterprise centres and business development centres, will benefit from an immediate addition to their portfolio of training services, offering better support for a new and growing group of young entrepreneurs which are currently not catered for. \r\n\r\nThrough the establishment of Regional Alliances, a wide spectrum of other stakeholders will be impacted positively, gaining greater awareness of the potential of street food to evolve into a mature and vibrant food sector and the specific policy tools and operational strategies that will enable them to achieve this. Based on this process and the commitments that each organization makes as part of the Regional Action Plan, high level stakeholders in enterprise training, economic development, tourism marketing will be better able to fulfil their organizational mission and to do so in a cost effective way (by pooling resources) which leads to a real increase in regional food identity, tourism and economic development.\r\n\r\nThe permanency of the Alliance will be cemented through the sense of achievement and strong social capital generated in the project and will become a reliable means of ensuring ongoing, systemic improvements to increasing the relevancy of VET for young food sector entrepreneurs and harnessing their growth as part of overall economic development strategies region by region.", "http://www.ncass.org.uk", "Trade Management Services Ltd", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013678_coordinator"], [2017, "Street Food Opportunit\u00e9s pour la jeunesse", "Trade Management Services Ltd", 149203.0, 6, 7, "SFOFY is designed to enable young people to develop an entrepreneurial skillset through exploring the business opportunities presented by street food, one of the fastest growing areas within the food sector.  Today\u2019s street food stall owners tend to be young and although they are brimming in innovative food business ideas, branding and digital marketing, they are often self-taught and lack formal enterprise education. Street food relies strongly on new ways of doing business which young people are comfortable with - total mobility, high levels of innovation, quality produce and dominance of social media marketing.  All these factors mean that young people are attracted to opportunities within the dynamic sector that can increase youth employment opportunities  central to the EU's employment policy,  Europe 2020. \r\n\r\nIn France  youth unemployment stands at 24% compared to a EU average of 17% (Eurostat, Feb 2017).  In Ireland , UK and Malta, youth under-employment is a concern, as young people fail to find jobs commensurate with their education and talents.   Entrepreneurship is widely recognized as a means to combat youth unemployment and social exclusion and thanks to the Entrepreneurship Action Plan more and more young people now gain access to entrepreneurial experience before leaving school or university.  \r\n\r\nBut what about the young people already outside the education system, and facing unemployment, underemployment or disadvantage in the labour market?    SFOFY is based on the premise that we can \u2013and must\u2013 do more to build entrepreneurial skills among this group of young people with raw talent.  Street food provides the ideal context for  promoting entrepreneurship education for youth as it: -\r\n\u2022 is an accessible entry point and innovation hotbed for low cost /shoestring food entrepreneurship \r\n\u2022 capitalises increasing customer demand for international, cultural diverse specialities opens up business opportunities for young entrepreneurs including migrant communities\r\n\r\nSFOFY will work to: \r\n1) Create Open Educational Resources to teach street food entrepreneurship skills specifically designed for young people \r\n2) Develop a Street food entrepreneur App to provide an accessible and appropriate way for young people to engage directly with the educational tools from their own mobile phone.  \r\n3) Create a Toolkit of Strategies for Markets to adopt a multicultural integration and experiential community for young food entrepreneurs. \r\n4)  Video Showcase Platform will present 24 short inspirational videos\r\n\r\nEach partner has been assigned leadership of the output or activity corresponding to their specific field of expertise and experience, but  all organizations will be involved in all tasks.  On completion, SFOFY will have produced the linkages, the knowledge and the resources to enable enterprise centres, VET and organizations across the youth and migrant services sectors to drastically improve access to and quality of entrepreneurship education for young street food entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\nWe give \r\n- YOUNG PEOPLE who were previously excluded or marginalized in the labour market, will be empowered to unlock their professional and personal capabilities. Some will go on to create street food businesses, many will use their entrepreneurial skillset for other employment or community benefits.  \r\n- ENTERPRISE CENTRES and other VET providers will gain greater awareness regarding the importance of inclusive entrepreneurship education and new and improved resources to cater to the needs of disadvantage groups through the lense of inclusion, diversity and intercultural integration. \r\n- YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS and MIGRANT SERVICES will understand the value of entrepreneurship skills, and will be able to refer beneficiaries to the open, online course as an immediate path for training and career development.\r\n- PROJECT PARTNERS will be the first to benefit from the ability to integrate new approaches to inclusive education and their work in synergy with organizations from other sectors. Staff will appreciate the more modern, professional environment and be more capable of work on high scale international collaborative projects.\r\n- WIDER STAKEHOLDERS from across the youth, food, VET and community services sectors will be exposed to new forms of inclusive entrepreneurship education and be more likely to commit to more practical strategies for improving inclusion and diversity on a wider level.\r\n- COMMUNITIES will see a rise in entrepreneurship and innovation among young people and benefit from the increased social integration and cohesion that comes from enabling young women to play a productive role in the economy and society.", "http://www.ncass.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-FR02-KA205-013673_2"]]}}}}
