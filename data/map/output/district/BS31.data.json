Generally, ICs are difficult to read documents that do not include all stakeholders\u2019 perceptions. Therefore, informative IC should be a process that include needed information under a gender and age perspective, more importantly if these are vulnerable populations. The relationship between science and society should favour the engagement inclusion of citizens in the informed consent process, and this must be done with especial attention to gender and ethics considerations. The IC process should also improve health literacy in the citizens. \nThe I-CONSENT project presents a simple work plan structure with a WP1 aimed to analyze baseline knowledge of IC, WP2 presenting innovative solutions and WP3 proposing new guidelines, disseminated in WP4. For this i-CONSENT consortium  presents a multi-stakeholder community of partners from academia, public health, patient organizations, clinicians and private sector, including pharma and SMEs, and a set of activities that will maximize the collection (workshops) and dissemination (communication plan) of information. \nSpecifically, and to ensure alignment with the Topic scope, the project will use a selection of 3 different vaccines as study frame to improve guidelines for informed consents. These do focus on vulnerable age populations with very special emphasis on gender: Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccines (preadolescent and adolescents), Meningitis (adults) and Respiratory Syncitial Virus (pregnant women). Besides Gender and Ethic issues as centre of the proposal, the project will consider the interaction of age and gender, with its specifics as comprehension of medical information, oral and written language, and availability and use of new technologies will also be considered.", 322011.0, 2691728.0, 4, 8, "I-CONSENT", null, null, null, "h2020_210058_937279767"], [1441065600000, 1535673600000, "New Operational Sensing sYstem", "Synectika Research and Consulting Ltd", "Organized crime investigation can greatly benefit from the availability of very small, concealable sensing devices to monitor, record and communicate criminal activity to remote surveillance stations.

REASON FOR THE APPSKIL PROJECTAppSkil aims to form an ICT Sector Skills Alliance focused on the mobile apps field that will: a) act as a collaboration platform that will link VET providers, sector representatives, and VET authorities, b) identify skills needs & mismatches, and c) develop and deliver an appropriate training programme connected with qualification frameworks. AppSkil faces the challenge to strengthen current and future ICT staff, working or aspiring to work in the mobile apps field, with business & design skills to improve sustainable employment results.B. MAIN APPSKIL RESULTS/OUTPUTS - A validated VET programme and open access learning resources on mobile apps creation skills in 6 EU languages- 1 \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d, 5 on-site and online training seminars, 7 dissemination events- A Memorandum of Understanding for mutual recognition and a Memorandum of Cooperation for the establishment of an EU ICT Skills CouncilC. EXPECTED BENEFITS/IMPACT AppSkil will build a Sector Skills Alliance to match workforce skills in mobile apps creation with labour market needs, improving sustainable employment in the sector. It will develop a VET programme based on the learning outcomes approach, ready to be integrated in NQFs and the EQF, and to promote mutual trust and mobility in ICT. ICT enterprises will be strengthened to identify personnel with sector-specific skills and VET providers will benefit through the availability of a sector-specific VET program ready to be recognised in diverse EU member states. AppSkil will provide ICT professionals with mobile apps creation skills required but missing from the market, enhancing personal development and job performance improvement, facilitating mobility.

The adoption of smart phones in EU is shifting the entire ICT ecosystem towards mobile apps, bringing fast-paced change on job profiles, competence needs and training. Mobile apps entrepreneurs and employees, apart from technical excellence and up-to-date software development skills, require business skills to adapt their ideas to users\u2019 needs, and advanced design skills to make the mobile app attractive and easy to use. The need for job-specific skills such as design and development of advanced services, combined with managerial, customer oriented skills and planning of resources allocation is well documented. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nVET4APPS aims to: \r\n\r\n1. Enhance VET provision for mobile apps entrepreneurs, employees and freelancers to address business and design skills needs, by designing appropriate training courses. \r\n\r\n2. Introduce new training delivery methods, enabling learners to improve and self-assess business and design skills.\r\n\r\n3. Make use and promote European reference tools by linking the designed curriculum with ESCO, EQF, NQFs, to facilitate mutual recognition of VET4APPS learning outcomes across EU.\r\n\r\n4. Offer operationally mature open educational resources based on a tested and evaluated training approach and materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS \r\n\r\nThe VET4APPS partnership brings together five partners with complementary skills, corresponding to the project requirements. UCBL, French University, brings the expertise in mobile apps courses design and development. UL-ICT Academy and GIP FCIP, as large VET providers, carry experience in organising training delivery. EXELIA develops innovative learning methodologies, e.g. MOOC, gamed-based learning. AELP, as a large association of VET providers in UK, will provide guidance on qualifications related issues and promote learning outcomes mutual recognition through its extensive network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES \r\n\r\n- Analysis of workforce training needs in mobile apps field to fine-tune the specifications for a VET programme for mobile apps entrepreneurs, employees and freelancers.\r\n\r\n- Development of learning units and recourses for a VET programme on the basis of the previous analysis.\r\n\r\n- Development and testing of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on mobile apps, promoting the adoption of innovative practices in vocational training.\r\n\r\n- Promotion and assessment of VET4APPS curriculum\u2019s compatibility with the EQF and endorsement of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to facilitate mutual recognition of the VET4APPS learning outcomes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEDAGOGIC METHODOLOGY \r\n\r\nVET4APPS employs innovative, student-centered, and personalized learning pedagogical approaches, putting learners interests first and placing the teacher as a facilitator of learning. Modularization and curriculum design on the principle of learning outcomes will allow learners to choose what units they study dependent on prior knowledge. The VET4APPS MOOC will further facilitate personalized learning approaches and open and flexible learning, as it will allow for studying at home or work, while offering the support of tutors and peers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\n1. A VET programme for mobile apps entrepreneurs, employees and freelancers to tackle business and design skills gap in mobile app field.\r\n\r\n2. Massive open online course to give learners and trainers free access to the VET4APPS learning materials.\r\n\r\n3.

Empowerment of learners with the business and design skills required for employability, through direct participation in play & training workshops and the MOOC.\r\n\r\n2. Increase of the relevance of mobile apps related VET offerings with the labour market.\r\n\r\n3. Mutual recognition of VET4APPS learning outcomes, credit transfer and accumulation among EU VET providers and sectoral enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGER TERM EXPECTED BENEFITS\r\n\r\n1. Mobile apps entrepreneurs and freelancers will improve employment prospects, obtaining a better fit within the fast growing mobile app market. ICT staff already employed in mobile apps field will increase their efficacy and productivity, meeting both current and emerging workplace demands.\r\n\r\n2. VET providers will enhance their offerings through the exploitation of VET4APPS learning materials to improve existing and develop new training programs, and through the adaptation of VET provision to the needs of the labour market, on the basis of data compiled in project.\r\n\r\n3. ICT enterprises will benefit from the anticipated matching of skill supply and demand, resulting in increased productivity and competiveness.\r\n\r\n4. Establishment of the preconditions and momentum for a future VET certification on mobile apps in line with NQFs and EQF standards, promoting labour mobility.", "http://www.aelp.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA202-008702_4"]]}}}}
