The Anticalin is specific for hepcidin which is a central regulator of iron homeostasis, and will be used to antagonize hepcidin for the treatment of \u201canemia of chronic disease\u201d (ACD). Anticalins are genetically modified lipocalins that can target almost any desired molecule. Unlike Immunoglobulins, they can be produced at low cost in microbial expression systems, are expected to be non immunogenic and offer therapeutic advantages where antibody effector functions are not desired. ACD, the most frequent anemia in hospitalized patients, develops in subjects suffering from infections, inflammatory and auto-immune disease, cancer and chronic kidney disease. It is often successfully treated by administering Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents. However, a significant number of patients are hypo- or non-responsive to ESA. Anti-hepcidin therapies, alone or together with ESAs, may improve anemia and the patients\u2019 erythropoietic response and enable the use of no or even much lower ESA doses, avoiding the potential detrimental effects of high doses of ESA. The Consortium has already generated proof-of-concept data in an animal model with early candidates. The project aims at identifying, validating, and developing a specific, high affinity drug candidate based on the lipocalin scaffold as promising alternatives to immunoglobulins and a therapeutic approach based on the neutralization of hepcidin. Animal models will be developed and utilized to characterize pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships, optimize dosing, to determine safety, biomarker responses and potential synergy with ESA\u2019s.

Separation and purification of proteins is usually achieved chromatographically, with all of its disadvantages including high buffer requirements, large footprint, reuse and storage of resin studies as well as costs. Traditional DSP based on batch chromatography contribute ca. 66% of the total production cost of anti-cancer monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Largely contributing to this is the cost of chromatography media; for instance, the cost of 1 L of protein A resin with binding capacity of 20-70 g mAb is about 25000 Eur. By a visionary and ambitious combination of the emerging Continuous Manufacturing Paradigm with innovative Membrane Crystallization Technology and the selective nanotemplate-recognitions directly from the fermentation broth, the AMECRYS Network aims to develop a new Continuous Template-Assisted Membrane Crystallizer in order to revolutionize the DSP platform for mAbs production, thus achieving unprecedented purification and manufacturing efficiencies. Major research challenges will include: i) the synthesis of 3D-nanotemplates with specific molecular recognition ability towards mAbs from complex solutions; ii) the development of tailored macroporous fluoropolymer membranes for advanced control of selective heterogeneous nucleation; iii) the design of multilevel microfluidic devices for high-throughput mAb crystallization screening in a wide range of conditions under continuous flow (\u201cpharma-on-a-chip\u201d concept); iv) technology scale-up to a L-scale continuous prototype designed with recognition of QS/GMP compliance for biopharmaceuticals.
