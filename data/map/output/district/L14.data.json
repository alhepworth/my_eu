The proposed approach promotes a comprehensive model of care including: empowerment of general practitioners and integration of care pathways through the adequate information sharing; remote monitoring of pacemakers; home monitoring of vital signs using wearables, Apps and available innovative devices; patient activation and increases the alignment of objectives among all involved stakeholders (providers, doctors, Hospital managers, patients).\nTo achieve these goals RITMOCORE proposes to move from a conventional purchasing of devices to an innovative service provision able to complement the resources of the public service providers including: support center for remote monitoring of pacemakers, delivering of pre-defined information sets to all stakeholders and professionals involved in the care path, integration and quality labeling of vital signs home monitoring devices and wearables and support for patient activation. The service will be based on a risk sharing model.\nSeveral partners of RITMOCORE are already working together on STOPandGO, a PPI addressing the development of a European Specification Template and a Reference Business Case for innovative ICT-enabled services for elderly people, being validated in 7 procurements. The experience of STOPandGO has been extremely enlightening on the main difficulties in addressing a PPI and the STOPandGO results will be used to shape the Business Case and the High Level Specifications in RITMOCORE.\nRITMOCORE procurers are leading cardiac care hospitals: Sant Pau in Barcelona (Spain), Liverpool Heart and Chest NHS Hospital (UK), Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital (NL) and the Regional Healthcare Trust of the Marche Region, with its hospital in Fermo (IT).", 975567.0, 11456801.0, 4, 9, "RITMOCORE", null, null, null, "h2020_206004_957928448"], [1483228800000, 1640908800000, "Paraplegia Prevention in Aortic Aneurysm Repair by Thoracoabdominal Staging with \u2018Minimally-Invasive Segmental Artery Coil-Embolization\u2019:  A Randomized Controlled Multicentre Trial", "Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Nhs Foundation Trust", "Chronic aortic aneurysms are permanent and localized dilations of the aorta that remain asymptomatic for long periods of time but continue to increase in diameter before they eventually rupture. Left untreated, the patients\u2019 prognosis is dismal, since the internal bleeding of the rupture brings about sudden death. Although successful treatment cures the disease, the risky procedures can result in paraplegia from spinal cord ischaemia or even death, particularly for aneurysms extending from the thoracic to the abdominal aorta and thus involving many segmental arteries to the spinal cord, i.e. thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms of Crawford type II.  Although various strategies have achieved a remarkable decrease in the incidence of paraplegia, it is still no less than 10 to 20%.  However, it has been found that the deliberate occlusion of the segmental arteries to the paraspinous collateral network finally supplying the spinal cord does not increase rates of permanent paraplegia.  A therapeutic option, \u2018minimally invasive segmental artery coil embolization\u2019 has been devised which proceeds in a \u2018staged\u2019 way to occlude groups of arteries under highly controlled conditions after which time must be allowed for arteriogenesis to build a robust collateral blood supply. PAPA-ARTiS is a phase II trial to demonstrate that a staged treatment approach can reduce paraplegia and mortality dramatically. It can be expected to have both a dramatic impact on the individual patient's quality of life if saved from a wheelchair, and also upon financial systems through savings in; 1) lower costs in EU health care; 2) lower pay-outs in disability insurance (est. at 500k in Year 1), and; 3) loss of economic output from unemployment.

The applicants for the international internship are highly motivated students of the 3rd year of the programme. The beneficiaries are carefully selected according to their studying achievements and practical skills and competencies already acquired during their prior field placements in the Czech Republic. The students are sent to well-established partners who have been cooperating with the college for many years and who have proved to comply with the requirements defined by the college as concerns the quality and contents of the student placements. We also emphasize that the particular choice of a placement by a particular student is consistent with the specialization, focus and prior experience of the student with respect to the target group(s) and the type(s) of the social service(s) provided.  \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the submitted project is to mediate to the selected students the unique opportunity to accomplish a part of their practical training for their future profession in a foreign country, which we see as a significant source of not only their professional development but also their personal growth and enrichment. By means of the gained know-how, the students significantly contribute also to the improvement of the quality of the college study programme and after their graduation and entry into the social work practice also to the development and implementation of new processes and methods into social work and social services in the Czech Republic. \r\n\r\nAnother important objective of this project is the maintenance and continuation of the established international partnerships. It is also a way that makes it possible to enrich our international cooperation by establishing contacts with new partners during the monitoring visits. This enables us to create a widest possible offer for the student placements and also to develop a dialogue among professionals from various EU countries, which annually culminates in February in the form of a meeting of experts from the Czech Republic as well as abroad at our college within the so-called Block of Experts. \r\n\r\nThe main expected outcome of the project is the personal and professional development and enrichment of the beneficiaries, who are equipped with new professional knowledge and practical skills and competences, are acquainted with the culture and socio-political situation of the host country. As concerns personal development, the beneficiaries will have gained more independence and flexibility, an open mind and a general detachment. Apart from these professional and personal aspects, the beneficiaries are expected to bring valuable data and documents for their graduation and/or bachelor theses. Highly valued is of course also the improvement in the area of communication and foreign language skills as a crucial tool for developing further international cooperation and/or drawing inspiration and knowledge from abroad in the practice of the social work profession. By implementing knowledge and good practice from abroad during their practice in social services in the Czech Republic and maintaining contact with professionals from other EU countries, the beneficiaries will have acquired a significant tool for development and improvements in social services in the Czech Republic as well as in the priority areas of the social policy within the EU.  \r\n\r\nAnother area we would like to focus on within this project is the introduction and implementation of the European Credit System in Vocational Education and Training (ECVET). It is a totally new area for us and we would like to get acquainted with it and extend our partnerships by this new dimension: the dialogue over the specific individual knowledge, skills and competencies defined for the profession of social worker. We would like to find out to what extent this area is developed and used in the countries of our partners as well as the individual partner organisations and how it is used in the process of vocational education.\r\n\r\nDuration of the project: 1/7/2014 - 30/6/2015\r\nLength of the placements: 8 weeks (56 days)\r\nPlanned period of the placements: 20 October to 14 Decemeber 2014\r\nHost countries: Germany, Slovakia, Ireland, Spain, the United Kingdom", "http://www.brothersofcharity.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-CZ01-KA102-001030_4"]]}}, "9NQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Making Opportunities through Volunteering and Enterprise", "North Huyton Communities Future", 24231.0, 2, 3, "M.O.V.E. provides two exchange activities involving 32 young people in each activity to allow partners in the UK and Romania to deliver non formal learning for young people aged 14-17  in our most deprived areas. It will do this by bringing young people not in employment, education or training (NEET) from different backgrounds together, to support their learning and help them develop their future employment prospects through joint activities delivered to introduce them to the concept of volunteering and social entrepreneurship.  Through a range of group activities, young people will work as a team to understand the value of volunteering for their own development and for society, and will work together to identify new ideas for the development of future volunteering activities in their own neighbourhoods. In doing so, M.O.V.E. also aims to break down existing barriers between young people from different backgrounds, and significantly widen their horizons through a greater understanding of cultural diversity and also the opportunities that exist within Europe outside of their own immediate location. The project works towards the achievement of a number of objectives related to the needs of groups in both partner countries. The project aims to:- bring local young people into contact with others, reducing cultural ignorance and intolerance- give a greater understanding of citizenship, and taking a more active role in local society - thinking about the potential for future volunteering on a personal level and for the communities in which they live- understanding the relationship between volunteering and social entrepreneurship - generate new ideas for supporting community development through new ideas for entrepreneurship including social enterprise- and through the above activities to give a greater sense of personal empowerment and achievement with a view to improving personal improved learning performance and ultimately employment prospects. In addition to longer term organisational impact leading to greater involvement in European cooperation and the development of the partnership with the American International School of Transylvania, specifically with regards to wider volunteering programmes and development of staff, impact on the young people participating in this youth mobility project will be significant and include:- Key competencies delivered through the activities linked to Youthpass - Increased willingness to volunteer and see the benefits of doing so for their own personal development;- Increased confidence to go to a place where English isn\u2019t the first language will impact not only on their own confidence to be more mobile, but also in doing so give them reason to challenge their own beliefs about what it is like to be in a country other than your own, improving local relations;- Inspiration for them to look beyond their current situation and allow comparisons to be made will enable participants to understand that the needs of young people elsewhere are the same as their own;- a change in attitudes and perception of people from different backgrounds- a sense of personal achievement having participated, been listened to and greater willingness to own their own ideas that we will take forward;- better relations and solidarity between young people which has an impact on their own state of mind and outlook.The longer term aim of this initial pilot project will be to scale up the activity for larger and more frequent exchanges, and develop more Strategic Partnership projects through Erasmus+ to achieve greater organisational learning and impact for our target groups.", "http://www.nhcfonline.org.uk", "Castle Cavendish Foundation", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA105-023219_2"]]}}}}
