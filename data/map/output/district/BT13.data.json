\"FABU.LA- Financial And Business Activities Learning\" project intends to engage, motivate and impassion young people of Primary Schools in entrepreneurship and financial literacy, by adopting an interdisciplinary, interactive, teaching model integrated with economic/financial knowledge, able to evolve learning methods, tools, solutions and situations.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on the scope of education, valorising the Primary School, as a key stakeholder to promote young children\u2019s way of thinking and acting proactively and enterprisingly, focusing on entrepreneurship and financial literacy to:\r\n\u2022 cultivate those values, that motivation that will enable them to find information to solve problems and implement \"entrepreneurial\" behaviour\r\n\u2022 help children to approach financial issues, to accompany them on a path that will lead them towards responsible and independent management of their resources.\r\n\r\nThese objectives will be achieved by:\r\na) Open Education Resources designed to facilitate the process of approach and familiarization with the basic elements of the culture of entrepreneurship and financial education, so that they acquire, in a simple and playful way, stories and practical examples that help to fuel economic and financial knowledge that, over the years, will be further fuelled to create the conditions needed for the adult of tomorrow, as an individual in a position to make informed and responsible financial decisions as well as engage in economic activities with awareness, sense of initiative, proactive vision and willingness to change and to take pondered risks.\r\nb) The Financial Educational Game, a financial behaviour and entrepreneurial \u201cgym\u201d, that through contextualized situations to everyday life, creates simple and intuitive learning conditions for users, following the edutainment logic, which will facilitate the understanding of the basic elements of economic and Financial knowledge stimulating direct participation in a recursive process of activation, testing and feedback through the game.\r\nc) \"FABULA STORY\", that, by applying the Storytelling methodology, will contain information, media clips and interviews with testimonials, expression of Stakeholders and students involved in acting, in small sit-coms, to stage the behaviour and rules learnt on the use of money in everyday life (buying goods and services, payment methods, the concept of credit and debt, payment forms).\r\nThe digital book also represents a Hub in which the promotion, communication and dissemination of the evolutionary dynamics of the project converge with the actions carried out, the results achieved and the children\u2019s experiences (the real protagonists of the initiative).\r\n\r\nThe project responds to the following critical issues:\r\n- low Global Competitiveness Index, particularly in primary education \r\n- low rates of entrepreneurship\r\n- low levels of Financial literacy performance.\r\n\r\nThe project will be implemented as follows:\r\n1) Analysis to identify methods to adopt to integrate elements of entrepreneurship and financial literacy in school curricula, identifying the areas perceived as most critical and possible methodological innovations to be implemented to facilitate learning.\r\n2) Development, design and production of OER to allow children to acquire the knowledge to:\r\na) become familiar with the concept of money, spending and saving\r\nb) understand the different sources of money and different uses\r\nc) learn the rules on the use of money in everyday life and the importance of relative adoption of choices in future life\r\nd) develop the main soft skills of entrepreneurial action\r\ne) understand what a business idea is and how to start a business\r\nto offer users in the website and through the Financial Educational Game.\r\n\r\n3) Design and implementation of the Educational Financial Game, in the

vulnerable citizens - people with disabilities; people who face economic obstacles, including young people and the long-term unemployed; people facing cultural obstacles such as migrant workers; people who have health problems; people with social obstacles, such as lone parents; and people who face geographical obstacles. Developed in NI in response to the needs of lone parents, the innovative 'Restart' accredited employability programme combines: group work, individual life coaching, a work placement, practical help with CVs and job applications, with advice on personal finances, childcare and transport issues. Restart has been already been successfully adapted for use with lone parents in 7 EU countries (including Poland and Italy) through the successful implementation and delivery of two separate EU projects funded through the LLP Leonardo da Vinci programme: Restart (2010 -2012) and Restart 2 (2012- 2014).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Restart 3 project will adapt the Restart programme for use with other disadvantaged groups: people with disabilities in NI, people from migrant backgrounds in Poland, young people in Italy and lone parents in Spain, all of whom are at high risk of becoming excluded from education, training, employment and full participation in society. This project seeks to implement the adaptation and evaluation findings from the previous Restart 1 & 2 projects and will follow a similar methodology thus bringing added value to the new project in terms of its evidence base and lead partner Possibilities NI's experience of delivery in Europe using a tested and successful methodology. The project will research the needs of each of the target groups in their respective country contexts, the Restart programme will then be adapted, translated where appropriate, pilot tested with a small group in each country (up to 10) and validated with methodology guidelines and reports created to document each stage of the project. Stakeholder seminars will be held for relevant stakeholders to assist with the programme import, delivery and sustainability of the Restart programme in each partner country. The project will also be evaluated and all of the reports will be combined to form the overall project report and final dissemination event will held in Belfast. A project website and a project film will be created  and all the project outputs will be disseminated widely by all the partners at national and international stakeholders. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will strongly link to the Europe 2020 Strategy (including headline education, employment and poverty targets) by ensuring that the most vulnerable people in society -  young people, migrants, lone parents and people with disabilities do not get left behind or become further socially excluded. The Project relates directly to the Erasmus+ objectives on equity and inclusion by promoting and facilitating access to the labour market, training and mobility opportunities to citizens from disadvantaged backgrounds at high risk of social exclusion and contributes to the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training by linking to ECVET and supporting the adoption of EU transparency and recognition tools such as Europass, EQF and ECVET.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will have a positive impact in respect of employment outcomes and contribution towards local regeneration and will also impact positively on beneficiaries taking part in the pilot in each transfer country by helping them move towards their goal of securing employment and achieving accreditation. The project will also have a positive impact in terms of usefulness for VET providers, employers and agencies working to support each of the target groups and will help reduce the number of unemployed persons within each of the partner countries by encouraging each partner to accredit and mainstream the programme for future and continued use. It will provide an opportunity for VET practitioners and managers to learn and develop new skills sets and areas of expertise with possible adaptation for e-learning and use with other groups.  The transfer and adaptation of the Restart model across Europe will also lead to a reduction in poverty levels among one parent families and the other disadvantaged groups at risk of social exclusion targeted by the project including economically inactive young people, people with disabilities and unemployed migrants. We also anticipate improved access to employment in each geographical area in which it is piloted and this will be assessed using feedback from the Stakeholders Forums in each country.
