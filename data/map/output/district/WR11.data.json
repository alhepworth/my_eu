The best place to spread and bring into force this idea and the recommendations of the UN must be schools, because education and children are the best way to change the world. We will join a trend - the school and local agenda 21 movement- that have been put into practice in some regions all around the world.\r\nThe \u201cAgenda 21\u201d is a concept created by the United Nations in the 1990\u00b4s with the slogan -\u201cthink globally and act locally\u201d. This idea tries to promote sustainable development and environmental protection in our town council, in our region and in our school. Each institution should have an \u201cAgenda 21\u201d to protect environment in a small scale. The European Union has signed recently (March 2013) an agreement in which it is shown the desire to enlarge the awareness of this idea and philosophy.  \r\nOur task or objective is to create a conscience at both local and school level by implementing a final document of AGENDA 21 for our schools. This document will be a model for other schools and  a turning point  in the awarenes and active participation in  the schools and local communities. The document will be included as a formal and official document in all our schools and it will be integrated with other existing normative, guidelines and rules. All the members of the strategic partnership will join the national ECO-SCHOOL association (some of them already belong to them) and   we will   carry out different and practical activities related to the items or issues that eco-schools work with: WASTE, LITTER, WATER, ENERGY, BIODIVERSITY, TRANSPORT,  SCHOOL GROUNDS, HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AND  SUSTANING OUR WORLD. Each one of the partners will lead  the task related with these environmental aspects .  We have focused in the  first 5 issues to design practical activities, but the other remaining items are included in the so called MEDA\u00b4s (MAIN ENVIROMENTAL DIRECT ACTION).  We will try to solve or improve a specific environmental problem in each community and the students will be an active part and they will prepare propossals and ideas to the councils, they  will take part in meetings with local authorithies , etc.  All the actions  will be done in collaboration with local and academic  authorities and will  involve all the members of our scnhool: students, parents, staff, managamenet, caretakers, admission office, etc.\r\nWe will implement  online plataforms (BLOG, E-TWINNING, PHP TOOL)  to work with, to share information and to produce documents and outputs. We will produce our own eco-audits and we will use those of ECO-SCHOOLS and other organizations involved with LOCAL OR SCHOOL AGENDAS 21\r\nWe will have two short term training courses about ECO - SCHOOLS  and PHP implementation, because these are two main aspects of our project. We will have several mobility meetings, one in each country. \r\nThe dissemination and desired impact of our project is very ambitious. We understand this project as an ongoing process that in a continuous and permanent way  incorporates  and change  the philosophy, practices, environmental management and curricula of our schools.  We try to be a model to other schools in the town and in the region.  We already have the support of the Town Council and Regional authorities. They are looking forward to considering our school as a pioneer centre to the implementation of AGENDA 21 in the schools.", "http://www.st-egwins.worcs.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA201-004466_4"]]}}, "7AA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1398902400000, 1530316800000, "Visual Analytics for Sense-making in CRiminal Intelligence analysis", "A E Solutions (Bi) Limited", "'The purpose of Project VALCRI is to create a Visual Analytics-based sense-making capability for criminal intelligence analysis by developing and integrating a number of technologies into a coherent working environment for the analyst we call the Reasoning Workspace. Conceptually, the Reasoning Workspace comprises three areas: (i) a Data Space which will enable an analyst to see what data and themes exist, (ii) an Analysis Space to which data can be brought into to carry out various computational analyses including statistical and text analysis, and (iii) a Hypothesis Space that will enable the analysts to assemble their evidence into coherent arguments that lead to meaningful and valid conclusions.\n\nThe user interface will be rooted in the concepts of Visual Analytics \u2013 the emerging \u201c\u2026 science of analytical reasoning facilitated by visual interactive interfaces' (Thomas and Cook, 2004), and specially designed to support the interactive dynamics (Heer and Shneiderman, 2012) required to enable real-time analytic interaction with data. The design of the user interface will move away from the traditional windows and list of lists views for presenting data, and instead to create information objects that may be directly manipulated and freely organised visuo-spatially by the analysts so that location and spatial groupings have meaning and can be manipulated directly by selection and dragging; or we can initiate Boolean operations on the content of the two or more clusters by dragging one cluster onto another. In addition, the presentation of multiple views of the information objects, in the form of network graphs, timelines, geo-spatial etc. can lead to further insight, especially when interactivity is enabled.

The prototype system will avoid the simulation paradigm where the trainee selects one of a number of pre-set drill oriented choices at a predictable decision point. Instead, using an interactive games paradigm, the trainees will be able to practice situation and cue assessment, problem diagnosis, decision making and action coordination, in real-time in response to a critical incident. Currently, one key problem hindering the maintenance of a high level of preparedness in operational security organizations at airports is the long 2-year wait between major exercises. In CRISIS, we will enable organizations and individuals to train-on-demand, and as frequently as needed due to the innovations, such as end-user re-configurability of training scenarios. This will allow staff to train individually &apos;playing&apos; against the system, as a team within an organization, across organizations, and at different levels of the command hierarchy.
