For this year the Plan predicts 100 mobilities, 80 mobilities for students and 20 mobilities for vocational teachers.In the analysis of application for getting Erasmus+ VET  Mobility Charter it was stated that the planned number is appropriate for the size and experience of our institution. As suggested by our national agency we reduced the predicted number of mobilities for vocational teachers from 20 to 9 and we increased the predicted number of students\u2019 mobilities from 80 to 91. Consequently, we reached the number of 100 planned mobilities. Except for the mobilities financed by EU funds, we plan to organise 8 students\u2019 mobilities with our own funds (zero grant) which also contributes to achieving the goal.\r\nIn the project GBM 2 Gospodarska \u0161kola will cooperate with 13 foreign partners. 6 of the foreign partners are educational institutions and 7 of them are business entities. The cooperation in this project will be continued with the 9 partners we have already worked with and 4 new partners. As for the organisation of the professional practice for students, the focus is still on establishing cooperation with the economic sector. For 83 students the practical training will be taking place in the economic entities and for 8 students the practical training will be held in workshops of partner schools. This will bring our institution closer to the labour market which is one of the priorities of Development Plan and Internationalisation Strategy. Vocational training for 62 students is predicted to last 2 weeks for students of final grades and one month for 29 students who are finishing their education. This brings us closer to reaching the goal set in the Strategy which says that by 2020 all the students of our school will have an opportunity to go on a two-week vocational training during their education or a long term training upon graduation. The professional practice includes students from all the sectors and professions and we are proud to be able to include students with disabilities and special needs in the mobilities.\r\nThis project will not only enable mobilities of the students but also the professional development through mobility for 8 vocational teachers. All the professional developments are related to the field of vocational courses and will take place in reputable partners with Erasmus + VET Mobility Charter and world known university. The professional development of our teachers will be done through participation in the educational process of the receiving institutions and through attending specialised courses related to field of study of teachers and their jobs in our school.

Furthermore the greatest number of mobilities will take place in business organisations. The students\u2019 mobilities include students with disabilities and special needs students and business companies can only receive a few of them at one time. Those are the reasons why it is necessary to send accompanying teachers with our students to their mobilities. We attempt to reduce the number of accompanying teachers or the length of stay for them. Still, we do not want to jeopardise the quality of the mobility.  \r\nBecause of the structure of our students to whom the mobility is almost always  the first time being abroad and the fear of parents for their children not being able to take care of themselves without adults, I believe that the number of accompanying teachers are necessary and justified.", "http://www.arts.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HR01-KA116-035154_10"], [2016, "Achieving and ReTrieving Creativity through European fashion Cultural HERitage Inspiration", "THE UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS LONDON", 132107.0, 4, 5, "The European textile industry has always been keen to preserve representative examples of textile production of the past, either for creative or for educational purposes.

Indeed the failure of businesses and the consequent closure of their warehouses has caused the loss of hundreds of textile samples and designs. In order to avoid breaking the line of continuity which joins past and future textile production - a fundamental feature of European excellence in the fashion sector - it is necessary for museums, cultural institutions and textile companies to protect our textile heritage.The project objective is to both to to contribute to the protection and exploitation of the fashion Cultural Heritage and organize and structure it in vocational training courses for the improvement of EU fashion designers (Fashion designers working in T&A Industries and young fashion designers).

The first week acquaints the participants with London as an economic hub. One key element involves working on case studies in English, presenting results and evaluating the process. This provides additional preparation for investigative company visits in the second week. Working in small groups, the trainees have previously arranged to research a local company in order to conduct interviews and report on a pre-arranged topic relevant to their chosen company. The third week further hones presentation skills as the groups finalize a written report and give a PowerPoint presentation to London teaching staff. The final week culminates in an examination of language skills pertaining to the London imput. The evaluation of the participants' performance (written report, presentation, final exam) provides evidence for themselves and for the project coordinators of the success of the Mobility project. Cooperation with a Finnish Vocational College brings a synergistic effect to the realisation of the project objectives.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, this project serves to enhance commercial relations between Germany and her international trading partners. Furthermore, on completing their apprenticeship, the participants not only have a better chance of being employed by the company where they trained, they have also increased their chances of taking up a position abroad. The risk of their being unemployed is minimized. Their subsequent employers derive the benefit of qualified personnel which heightens their competitiveness.", "http://www.berlitz.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-002039_1"]]}}, "7JZ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Resources for Education in Valuation Standards in Europe", "Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation", 206843.0, 5, 5, "The project is the result of an initiative for joint cooperation between the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers in Ireland in cooperation with the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation (UK), both of which are fully utilising the standards in their training and professional practice. \r\n\r\nThe European Group of Valuers' Associations (TEGoVA) represents 44 Valuer Associations from every country in Europe. It has published European Valuation Standards for a number of years, the seventh edition will be published in September 2015. EVS 2015, or the Blue Book as it is known, will be a professional practice manual which is effectively a summary of the accumulated knowledge and experience of European practice and valuation.  However, it does not provide practical information on how to conduct a property valuation and most certainly does not contain material which could be used in a training context. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to develop learning material which will be used both in a training context and as a guide for professional practice in the industry. It is intended that it will contain \r\n\r\n - Training modules to address the EVS2015 standards\r\n - Training plans\r\n - Training needs analysis tool\r\n - Production material including hard copy, DVD and web based \r\n\r\nThe project will utilise a Prince 2 methodology driven by a series of plenary meetings and working groups. The  following is planned as the result of the application:\r\n\r\n- Development of a general training manual and modules on EVS 2015 based on training modules produced by IRRV and IPAV;\r\n- Support for partner countries to undertake their own modifications to the material to enable it to comply with local standards and requirements;\r\n- Dissemination procedures and training sessions on EVS 2015 using developed training modules and templates.\r\n- The development of an appropriate infrastructure to project the outputs from this project into the future and to ensure that the project is sustainable beyond the period of EU intervention.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the outputs from the project will reach all 44 Valuer Associations across Europe. This will result in a potential audience of over 140,000 individual practitioners. \r\n\r\nIn the short term, it is expected that project will immediately make available to those above a comprehensive training resource pack which will enhance the understanding and the application of the European Valuation Standards.\r\nIn the long term, the product will be embedded in to each of the 44 Valuer Associations.  This will enable the members of those organisations to access the system either manually or electronically.  \r\n\r\nAs well as the impacts outlined above, the outputs from the project will further enhance the understanding of the European Valuation Standards across the whole of Europe and will increase their application in order to meet the various directives on valuation processes. The impact of these standards will also improve the \u201csafety net\u201d which will ensure that appropriate economic indicators are properly considered in all property valuations thus reducing the possibility of the economic chaos which engulfed European countries in 2008.\r\n\r\nThe skills acquired as a result of the resource pack will give participants the knowledge and understanding of the European Valuation Standards which will improve their competence as Valuers and impact on the quality of their valuations.  Consequently this will enhance the status of the individual in the work place and improve there opportunities for the development of their skills and thus offer wider work opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop and enhance the overall understanding and application of the European Valuation Standards across the whole of Europe and the wider use of the standards will be an inevitable outcome of this wider understanding.  This will in turn increase the number of policy areas in which the standards will become influential.  This will be particularly evidenced in the property market where a transnational approach for valuation is important to ensure consistent transacting of properties across borders. \r\n\r\nLooking further ahead the establishment of the standards will provide cross border consistency in the practice and delivery of valuations of land and buildings which will assist the customer of the valuation process.", "http://www.irrv.net", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IE01-KA202-008672_2"], [2015, "Valuer Access to Recognised Vocational Education and Training", "Institute of Revenues, Rating & Valuation", 104206.0, 5, 5, "The purpose of this project is to invest resources in the development of a new Europe wide foundation vocational training and qualifications network based on IRRV's vocational training framework for real estate valuation training in UK.   IRRV is an accrediting awarding body for vocational qualifications in the UK by the main government sponsored national accreditation body, which means that its education department can organise and award its own qualifications.  It is therefore is an excellent position to lead a project to deliver a trans-European vocational qualification in real estate valuer training which has eluded all previous attempts to establish at this level a genuine transparent international qualifications regime in valuation across Europe.  There is a desire by all partners to make this happen because more and more valuation business is becoming international by nature and larger clients are demanding that valuers are appropriately qualified. Whilst most countries have full professional qualifications linked to cognate degrees, the marketplace lacks a foundation vocational qualification for valuation, so that people with lower level qualifications along with groups such as returnees to work and socially disadvantaged have the opportunity obtain training and certification . The aim of the project is to deliver such a qualification using European VET initiatives with an objective to deliver a training and certification which can be recognised across the partners and ultimately across Europe.   No comparable training is currently available in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the consortium that will implement the proposal are that they are six professional bodies in separate countries that are concerned with delivering an effective and ethical expertise in valuation that will serve the economies of each of the countries. Very few of the new Member States, including those which joined in 2004 and 2007, have a sufficiently developed infrastructure to devise and implement a foundation qualification in valuation.  However, change is happening at a very rapid pace and Eastern European associations can now make meaningful contributions to such a project.\r\n     \r\nThe tangible outcome will be the creation of a series of modules which will form the basis of a trans-European training and qualifications regime which will create in each participating partner country the opportunity for people wishing to develop their valuation skills and assist cross border mobility of those with these skills.  The intangible outcomes will be the creation of trans national skills amongst other professionals in related sectors who wish to obtain a foundation level certificate in a key element of the European economy.  The intention is to deliver ultimately a solution to valuation training in all member states, where there is a combined footprint of 145,000 valuers, together with other professionals, such as those working in financial services and local government, who will be impacted by this project. \r\n\r\nThe impact envisages an improvement in basic real estate valuation education and training and the creation of a workforce that will benefit from the application of principles of mutual recignition to deliver a consistent understanding of the foundation principles of real estate valuation.", "http://www.irrv.net", "Institute of Revenues, Rating & Valuation", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013778_coordinator"]]}}, "7QH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Pr\u00e1cticas en Europa Erasmus +, fp grado medio, FCT y titulados.", "FERNANDO SCORNIK GERSTEIN", 63740.0, 4, 11, "We are requesting 14 mobilities for students and graduates of  IVT training degrees  involved in the families of administration, electricity and IT of our institute , they will complete their FCT period or they will do an internships as graduates in companies of UK, France and Italy\r\n  \r\nMOBILITIES QUALITY :\r\n  \r\nAlways there will be only one participant in each company except in the case of students in the electricity companies, they have enough workload and the tutor 's ability to accommodate two students.\r\n  \r\nWe have enough partners host  to ensure maximum utilization and improve the integration of the participant in the company and the destination city and to deal with any unforeseen change   that may arise.\r\n\r\nWe have the experience and infrastructure necessary based on experience from previous years in different European programs to carry out this project , facing any unforeseen problems that might arise during  his development.\r\n\r\n  \r\nApplicant Organization : Public IES Alonso de Avellaneda of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares will manage all aspects of project completely autonomously .\r\n  \r\nHost partners in the UK ( 7) , France (2 ) and Italy ( 1).\r\n  \r\nNEEDS :\r\n \r\n- Improving training for IVT trainees with the completion of the FCT in European companies.\r\n- Increase the employability of these students and graduates of these degrees.\r\n- To enable participants to learn to work in a European business environment.\r\n- Expand their business horizons , self-sufficiency and ability to work in an international team .\r\n- Improve their professional and linguistic skills.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES :\r\n- Increase the possibility of  mobility of  IVT students.\r\n- Raising the quality of the FCT .\r\n- Improving the employability of these students and recent graduates .\r\n- Learn new techniques used by European companies in each of the specialties.\r\n- To facilitate this learning experience to people who otherwise would have no chance , promoting equal opportunities for different types of students.\r\n- Increasing the prestige of the IVT and interest of the general population in order to follow these studies.\r\n- Promote the use of  IT's in IVT and teaching \"on line\"\r\n- Encourage the use of our virtual platform through internet based Moodle \"Pr\u00e1cticas en Europa Erasmus +, fp grado medio FCT y titulados\"\r\n- Expand our network of companies and partners  \r\n\r\nRESULTS : Increasing interest in studying an IVT degree ,learning languages in order to do  FCT's in another country, or doing an internship  as graduates, increasing their motivation , improving the social image of the IVT\r\n  \r\nWHERE : \r\nParticipants will do the internship in companies in the UK, France and Italy\r\n  \r\nWHEN:\r\n- 11 weeks during the regular period of the FCT's : From March to June 2015 for the trainees of Administration, Electricity and IT degrees.\r\n- To graduates will also be 11 weeks , the dates between January and April 2015.\r\n\r\nWe ask two training mobilities of staff, one for UK and one for France, will be prepared and planned carefully with the help of our partners to make them as profitable as possible, for IVT teachers into the  IT, electrical and administration degrees.
