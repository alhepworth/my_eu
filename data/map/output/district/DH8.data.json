Consequently, the participation to the Erasmus+ project is even more effective in helping the school comply with the new requirements and offering the trainees an invaluable experience that might even steer the beneficiary towards specific future working/training choices. \r\nAlthough the work placement is an important stage of the process of personal growth for the participants, a good project does not confine itself to the period of work experience abroad, but preliminarily it offers preparatory activities at school that cover the whole span of the project\u2019s life. \r\nA qualifying feature of the experience is the planning and testing, rich in content and quality, of the Learning Outcomes Units inspired by the ECVET system and of the agreed upon learning objectives with tools such as the MoU and the LA, both with the traditional partners of the CREDCHEM network and with the ones of the educational and tourist fields, with the purpose of acquiring skills that can be transferred to national and international contexts. \r\nIn order to promote this good practice that can be applied in particular in the context of the Technical school of Chemistry, this year more mobilities will be reserved for the students of the Chemistry branch, consistently with the Key Objectives of ET2020 to make science and technology more appealing while improving one\u2019s language skills, strengthening creativity and innovation as key factors of a sustainable economic development. \r\nHigh quality skills and competences for employability, innovation, active citizenship and welfare, together with transparency and competence and qualification recognition, are explicitly recommended among the 6 priorities of the 2016-2020 period.  \r\nThis important goal is reached thanks to work-based learning provided by the work placements, which have the following objectives: \r\n\u2022 For the Chemistry Technical School: acquiring methodologies and procedures in the field of chemical, biological, biotechnological, environmental hygiene and healthcare analysis; interpreting results and writing reports; using instruments; performing qualitative/quantitative analysis with different methodologies;\r\n\u2022 For the Foreign Languages School: developing multilingual communicative skills in the tourist and cultural fields in hotels, tourist offices, libraries, recreation/cultural centres, universities, museums; collaborating in the organization of events, planning itineraries, managing reservations and quotes; collaborating in an educational team by planning activities relevant to the interests of the participants using one\u2019s communicative skills. \r\nThis project supports the teachers involved as tutors in a process of continuous professional development through projects of teacher mobility (ERASMUS+ CLIL O.W.Ne.R.S. 2016-1-IT02-KA101-022762); this opportunity will be taken this year by some of the tutors that have most recently joined the Erasmus+ team, to improve their teaching competence and language skills as teachers of non-language-related subjects.", "http://www.dets.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005740_11"], [2016, "Non-formal And Informal Learning and International Training IN EUROPE", "Derwentside Environmental Testing Services Ltd", 197324.0, 10, 28, "The project called \u201cNon-formal And Informal Learning and International Training IN EUROPE\u201d- NAIL IT IN EUROPE offers 105 students the possibility of a training experience abroad and it counts on the collaboration between IIS Scalcerle and bodies such as Xena (for the monitoring of competences), the town and province administrations of Padova and F\u00f2rema Confindustria (for the training of the applicants concerning entrepreneurship and the soft skills useful in the job market and for the project dissemination in the local socio-economical and manufacturing context).The foreign partners are 27 in 9 different European countries. With some of them there is reciprocity both in the Mobility program and in other LLP and Erasmus+ programs.The foreign network includes various work and/or training organizations: companies, chemical labs, public bodies, training bodies, universities, museums, hotels and others in the tourist, cultural and commercial fields.The new professions will require updated digital skills, entrepreneurship and a sense of initiative; many of the key competences for an active citizenship can be found among the objectives of NAIL IT IN EUROPE.Our ambitious aim is to highlight and promote the development of creativity and problem-solving skills in the working and entrepreneurial fields. These are soft skills that are developed also through non-formal and informal learning, which is particularly significant in the context of a work placement experience abroad managed autonomously in many ways by the beneficiaries.  On a European level, this aim cannot be reached without competence in foreign languages and a deeper awareness of European citizenship.The work placement experience is only one step along this process of growth and awareness and it needs coordinated and solid planning and implementation of preparatory activities that invade the sphere of traditional teaching and modify contents and methodology of the students\u2019 curricula.The beneficiaries of the NAIL IT IN EUROPE project are 105 students of IIS Scalcerle and other schools of the province, selected according to shared criteria which are described in the quality procedures of the school. They are trainees at their initial training stage who will get a High School or Technical School Diploma corresponding to level 4 of EQF. They have concluded the 4th year of their educational training (either the Foreign Languages course or the Chemistry, Materials and Biotechnologies technical course). Immigrant students and an elevated percentage of women are involved. The work placements will last from 2 to 4 weeks.The work placements abroad will be organized, monitored and assessed mainly by using ECVET criteria and will be meant to allow the acquisition of competencies that can be built up in time and acknowledged at a national and an international level in different contexts. With NAIL IT IN EUROPE,  Learning Outcomes and ECVET will be developed further. The content and the quality of the LO and the training objectives will be agreed upon by using tools such as the MoU and LA both with traditional CREDCHEM partners and with partners of other fields.The impact on the school and the staff that manages the project is considerable. More and more teachers have felt the need to be more informed and up to date on the topic in order to support their students more effectively in this experience. The comparison with other educational systems generates an effective cooperation also in the different subject departments, where learning objectives and curricula are updated. In a peer-education context, former trainees are involved to train the new applicants, to act as tutors and to be part of a working team that analyses the fallout and effects of the mobility experience on the future professional or educational life of the students. Besides the focus on soft skills, the project pursues the achievement of the following technical and professional skills in different fields:Chemical-biological:Learning methodologies and procedures in the fields of chemical, biological, biotechnological, environmental and sanitary analysis; interpreting results, writing reports; using instruments; performing a qualitative-quantitative analysis with different methods.Foreign languages, tourism:Developing multi-lingual communicative skills in the tourist, art and culture fields in hotels, tourist offices, libraries, leisure and cultural centres, universities, museums; helping in the organization of events promoting the cultural heritage of an area or exhibitions; planning itineraries; managing reservations and quotes.Child-care and educational services:Developing communicative skills which are not only multi-lingual but also focused on the beneficiary (nursery school children, young people in leisure centres); collaborating in an educational team; planning activities in consideration of the attention span and level of involvement of very young beneficiaries.", "http://www.dets.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA116-004989_1"], [2015, "Entrepreneurship: a gateway to a growing education", "Derwentside Environmental Testing Services Ltd", 193501.0, 10, 26, "The ENGAGED (Entrepreneurship: a gateway to a growing education) project involves the collaboration among IIS Scalcerle, other schools  in the area, Xena  for competence monitoring, City Hall and the Province of Padova, F\u00f2rema from Confindustria.\r\nThe partners are in 9 European countries.With some there is a situation of reciprocity, both in the Mobility and other LLP programs; the foreign network includes business companies, chemistry labs, public administrations, educational institutions, universities, museums, hotels and other partners in the fields of tourism, culture, commerce.\r\nWe aim at consolidating and developing the mobility to keep offering many students the possibility to have temporary work placements abroad (Obj.ve 1 of the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020).\r\nThe work placements abroad will be organized, monitored and evaluated according to ECVET criteria and they will be planned with the aim of acquiring increasing skills that can be acknowledged in several national and international contexts.\r\nThe skills acquired in non-formal contexts can enhance a young person\u2019s professional assets and they will be useful in a labour market that is evolving fast (Europe 2020 on increasing the employment rate).

By its very nature, the surface of a filter is an open structure in which microorganisms can readily settle. Nutrients available in the in-feed enable these to grow. As a result biofilms develop leading to an overall reduction of filtration efficiency of 30-50%, unstable processes and frequent filter change. A multitude of strategies are tried to reduce membrane fouling which in itself demonstrates the urgency of the problem. Current strategies, often used in combination, are: enhanced modules and membranes, cross-flow filtration, low flux, regular back flush, permeate stoppage, scouring, sparging, rinsing cycles, chemical cleaning with soda, caustic or tenside solutions. ConductMem will develop an advanced system that can permanently prevent biofilm formation and surface fouling by the electrolytic production of biocidal oxidising agents on the membrane surface itself. The conductive membrane operates as an anode. The current flow will generate OH-radicals, Ozone and Hydrogen Peroxide on the membrane surface. These oxidizing agents degrade organic matter and disinfect the surface.

Bacteria in hospitals present a major health issue.The effectiveness of cleaning is considerably enhanced on smooth, scratch-free surfaces.Anti-bacterial silver coatings are available; however they are not used in hospitals due to cost, effectiveness and durability.Copper offers a low cost, effective and environmentally friendly solution that could be readily adopted. The challenge is to retain copper nano-particles in a structure that provides antibacterial functionality, but prevents leaching.The CuVito consortium believes that the silsesquioxane structure, formed using Vitolane technology is the answer.\nSilsesquioxanes have the formula RSiO1.5 (where R is an organic ligand), and form cage or ladder structures.They confer hardness and abrasion resistance to coatings and, by selecting appropriate R groups (e.g. acrylate, glycidoxy) can chemically bond to the organic resin in the formulation controlling cross-link density to enhance durability.Hence silsesquioxanes are inherently suited to use in coatings for surfaces which require regular cleaning.Silsesquioxanes have been available for some years but at a prohibitively high cost, due to the complexity of manufacture.Vitolane technology is an alternative, cost effective production route which has been patented and is currently being scaled up commercially.It has a unique processing feature in allowing simple selection of R groups and it is proposed to use this to bond directly to the copper nanoparticles, resolving the issue of leaching.The objectives of the project of the project are:\n1.Develop a copper nano-particle production process\n2.Functionalise silsesquioxanes with copper using Vitolane technology\n3.Produce a commercially acceptable coating\n4.Validate coating in a hospital environment", 61314.0, 1685792.0, 4, 8, "CUVITO", "http://www.cuvito.eu", "http://www.thomas-swan.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/156438.jpg", "fp7_97537_984372103"], [1391212800000, 1485820800000, "Self-repairable Zinc-free Weldable Anti-corrosion Primer for the Steel protection", "Thomas Swan & Co Limited", "The global production of steel is in the range of 1400M tons, worth nearly \u20ac1trillion.

Most of this steel is carbon or mild steel (as opposed to stainless steel) which corrodes at a high rate and although there are a significant number of anticorrosion solutions on the market, protective coating is most widely used, thanks to its low cost and high versatility. Often, an anticorrosion primer is applied just after manufacturing of steel in order to prevent rusting during storage and transportation before fabrication (cut,weld,drill,etc). Most anticorrosion primers last max 6 month due to poor quality or mechanical damage resulting in corrosion. Additionally, these anticorrosion primers are often too thick (~50\u03bcm) preventing weld quality, so time consuming localised grinding is done to remove the primer. If the primer is thin enough (~25\u03bcm) to allow welding, its anticorrosion properties are so limited, not reducing the risk of corrosion. Above all, the increased zinc content in the weldable primer formulation in order to achieve the anti-corrosion property result in health hazards and discomfort during fabrication process as it releases significant amount of zinc fumes. Alternatively, primers are simply not used at all but the expensive and hazardous blast cleaning of steel is carried out before fabrication which may sometimes be too late that it results in huge material waste and cost.
