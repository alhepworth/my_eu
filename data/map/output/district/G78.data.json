It has a current roll of 295.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish Government\u2019s report, \u201cLanguage Learning in Scotland: A 1+2 Approach\u201d means that from 2021, every child will be entitled to learn a first additional language from age 4 in Primary One, and a second by age 8 (Primary Five).\r\n\r\nIn the Autumn of 2017 an audit of proficiency in French was carried out and its findings identified a development need in the area of the teaching of French and the necessity to increase the language skills of our general teaching staff and develop staff confidence in their ability to embed language learning in to daily routines.\r\n\r\nOur 2-year KA1 project seeks to raise proficiency in French of participants in order that they are equipped to deliver high quality, motivating lessons needed to be ready for 2021. The project is named \u2018Language Learning at the Heart of GIRFEC\u2019. GIRFEC is the national approach in Scotland to improving outcomes and supporting the wellbeing of children and young people.  \r\n\r\nEight participants, teaching and non-teaching members of staff, will travel to Carcassonne to attend eight-day structured courses at intervals over the two years.  The participants will engage in a selection of carefully planned and targeted language and cultural activities, each with a particular pre-determined focus. This will enable participants to increase language proficiency and develop their confidence in using French, leading to increased use of the target language in their lessons on their return to the UK.\r\n\r\nExperiencing stimulating opportunities for language learning in an inclusive and accessible way will equip participants with valuable life-skills and broaden cultural horizons. On their return, participants will share their learning with 31 colleagues across the campus, enhancing and enriching the school\u2019s curriculum.  The experience will give participants a bank of effective and engaging ideas to encourage active learning and facilitate excellence in the primary languages classroom.\r\n\r\nOur \u2018Language Learning at the Heart of GIRFEC\u2019 project supports the ethos of Erasmus+. Language and literacy development in French, cognitive skills and intercultural awareness will all be enhanced for pupils, and the wider community as the project progresses and is disseminated across the campus and beyond.  \r\n\r\nThe school is highly committed to raising its European profile and is an active eTwinning School. Raising attainment in Modern Languages will become a key driver in the School Improvement Plan.  Valid and reliable evidence will be provided by participants at all stages in the project.\r\n\r\nThe potential longer-term benefits of the project will be increased links between British and French teachers with a view to developing future eTwinning projects and potential Exchange visits between schools.  The school has aspirations to become a \u2018Centre of Excellence\u2019 for modern languages, and this project will assist in achieving this goal.  This will have long-lasting benefits for all stakeholders, increasing intercultural awareness for pupils, and the wider community as the project progresses and is disseminated across the campus and beyond.", "http://www.neilston.e-renfrew.sch.uk", "Neilston Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047276_coordinator"]]}}}}
