If making existing infrastructure \u201csmarter\u201d is achieved by making it more complex, would it also make it more vulnerable? Would this affect resilience of an SCI as its ability to anticipate, prepare for, adapt and withstand, respond to, and recover?\nThese are the main questions tackled by this proposal.\nThe proposal envisages answering the above questions in several steps. (#1) By identifying existing indicators suitable for assessing resilience of SCIs. (#2) By identifying new \u201csmart\u201d resilience indicators (RIs) \u2013 including those from Big Data. (#3) By developing a new advanced resilience assessment methodology (TRL4) based on smart RIs (\u201cresilience indicators cube\u201d, including the resilience matrix). (#4) By developing the interactive \u201cSCI Dashboard\u201d tool. (#5) By applying the methodology/tools in 8 case studies, integrated under one virtual, smart-city-like, European case study. The SCIs considered (in 8 European countries!) deal with energy, transportation, health, water\u2026\nResults #2, #3, #4 and #5 are a breakthrough innovation.\nThis approach will allow benchmarking the best-practice solutions and identifying the early warnings, improving resilience of SCIs against new threats and cascading and ripple effects.

The community host organisations will also be responsible for engagement for one of the hardest-to-reach groups at most risk of social exclusion.  The project is based on a successful pilot carried out by a group of London Local Education Authorities in 2012/3 and was inspired by the US Brooklyn Library model http://www.bklynpubliclibrary.org/only-bpl/literacy/english-classes.   It is scalable, replicable and based in the heart of local communities.WELCOME targets those people who have only basic or no skills at all in their host country language who need to improve their host language to acquire information, services, employability and digital skills and, to integrate with the wider community.  Some of these may be refugees traumatised through conflict and dangerous journeys to Europe, some recently arrived economic migrants unable to access the information and services they need and others may have lived in their host country for many years but only have a poor command of the language \u2013 for example, many older women do not leave their community.
