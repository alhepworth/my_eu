The project will present its activities and products mainly in 2017, which is declared a European year of Entrepreneurship. We want to give our pupils the best possibilities for developing their social entrepreneurship skills but also to make them face  the social realities  motivating them for doing voluntary work. We will put efforts in cultivating self- awareness towards different people, empathy towards the ones that suffer and a desire to share the value to help each other. That is why volunteering is the second important point that will be present in our project. If a person is surrounded with models which express an urge for helping others, the chances to adopt these models are really great. This is a project which will encourage the study of English language in the sphere of entrepreneurship by writing a handbook \u201cSuccessful steps in entrepreneurship\u201d and the use of English language as a working base with the students from the partner countries. The main aim of the project, which includes 5 schools from 5 different countries, is to establish the criteria for successful implementation of an entrepreneurial idea on the European market.To achieve the goal of the project, the following activities will be organized: a competition, called \u201cEntrepreneurs of Future\u201d on a given topic in every country; \u201cEntrepreneurship\u201d- when students meet and they will also be supported by mentors, PTA representatives and NGOs. The final product will be a handbook \u201cSuccessful steps in Entrepreneurship\u201d. This handbook will present all mandatory stages that every entrepreneurial idea goes through from its origin to its fulfillment. We are 5 primary schools from different countries and we have planned to make two training meetings in the middle of each year. At these meetings the participating teachers and students will discuss the criteria and features that every successful entrepreneurial idea should conform to. During these training meetings voluntary initiatives, aiming at solving both a social and ecological issue, will also be organized. The voluntary initiative with eco focus will be \u201cPlant a tree, save the Earth\u201d- cleaning a particular region, collecting waste, planting trees and from the waste collected- making an art product. The voluntary initiative solving a social issue will be called \u201cDance with me\u201d- a dance lesson in SOS children\u2019s villages/ family-type accommodation centers/ nursing homes.The ideas, participating in \u201cEntrepreneurship\u201d, will be presented to business representatives, other students and educational institutions, too. Thus, the participants in the project will become part of global education, aimed at performing the goals of sustainable development. These goals will definitely be a priority in the next 15 years. Entrepreneurship and initiative, one of the key competences mentioned in the European Framework of Reference, can solve one of the global problems. Project activities will be based on what present skills requires and that is flexibility. That is why, students will combine knowledge in ICT, foreign languages, entrepreneurship, business research, geography and even psychology. Good practices and innovation will also be applied in the curriculum. We will cooperate with non-governmental organizations, local formal and informal institutions, similar schools and schools in the region to distribute products and project results. This synergy is shown in the fact that the project unites students with different interests, coming from different socio-economic environments. Our aim is to define common points of interest and create products which will be a symbol of cross-border cooperation through entrepreneurial skills. One of the best activities will be the organization of voluntary initiatives. The best art products will be awarded and long-lasting dissemination will be ensured.We will achieve project sustainability by making films for each stage on CDs. The handbook \u201cSuccessful steps in Entrepreneurship \u201c will be presented to each partner country on paper and uploaded online on project\u2019s page.Partners will prepare and publish two issues of magazines.
