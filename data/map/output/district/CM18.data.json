To realise this ambition we, as an education group, always have three fundamental standing points, namely connecting worlds, being relevant and exceeding expectations. Lentiz | Floracollege is a small-scale school, where small steady teams work together to provide fitting en continuing education for our pupils, by staying with them their whole school carrier in the school. One experiences the school as healthy, clean and safe. The school provides education for pupils with VMBO level. Indicated pupils can receive extra support in the school. \r\n\r\nTo match the expectations of the companies in the international context of our school, where our pupils will end up, we organize many international activities. This means exchanges, emailprojects and explaining different cultures in the school. For this reason the school has the need to professionalize teachers in the field of languagecourses and jobshadowing in England. Three teachers of the lower level classes will participate in a language course and one teacher, related to the BizNizclass (special class for pupils with affinity with business) will do jobshadowing in England. \r\n\r\nThe most important activities and methods are:\r\nPreparation phase\r\nThere will be three internal meetings where the starting level of the teachers are measured and to compose the learning agreements for the teachers. \r\n\r\nExecutive phase \r\nIn this phase the teachers will participate in the language course in Malta en go jobshadowing in England. \r\n\r\nReflecting phase \r\nTeachers will use this phase of six weeks after the course to reflect on their learning goals and how they\u2019re going to disseminate their knowledge. \r\n\r\nDisseminating phase\r\nDissemination is done through meetings of the teachers from the same subject, organizationdays and Lentiz meetings for all schools. \r\n\r\nLong term effects\r\nThere are multiple long term effects:\r\n- The quality of the lessons in the upper level classes are heightened, which is ensured in the sections of the subjects. \r\n- The Lentiz education group vision regarding internationalisation is strengthened. \r\n- Other Lentiz schools are inspired to professionalize their own staff so they can raise the bar of their quality of education\r\n- More teachers who are able to give English lessons in the lower level classes\r\n- English culture in the lessons of the BizNizclass to prepare them for future business relationships.", "http://www.passmoresacademy.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NL01-KA101-000456_1"]]}}, "7PS": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "INCLUSIVE LEARNING FOR STUDENTS", "Kingsmoor Academy", 92665.0, 5, 5, "This project includes five primary schools from UK,IT,PL,GR,TR. It will be applied with the pupils aged between 7-15. \r\nThe project focuses on the problem of social exclusion (in terms of basic skills lack). In order to reach this goal of inclusion we will practice new strategies and methods of teaching cooperatively and inclusively at schools and during leisure time activities.\r\n\r\nThis application refers to the particular needs of students according to the needs analysis which took place at all the partner schools. As the project group, we discussed and defined 4 issues which prevent the school success.(1-Lack of social inclusions; 2-lack of basic skills; 3-Lack of parental support; 4-Lack of socio-economical needs ). The needs analysis has been done in five schools by taking the observation of the teachers\u2019 view, taking consultant teachers\u2019  ideas into account, applying basic survey which evaluates those four obstacles. We came to the following conclusions: in UK, it seems they have no problem with 1 and 3 but they need to increase the level of basic skills and help some students who have problems with number 4. Other schools have problems mainly with number 4 obstacle. In Polish and Italian schools, \u201clack of social inclusion and basic skills \u201d of the students  are seen as the most important problems which prevent students from adapting an academic success. In Turkish and Greek schools \u201clack of basic skills, lack of parental support, lack of socio-economic needs\u201d stands for the first reason for failure. \r\n\r\nBesides,  each school has different good practices in their school curriculum (see related sections). They will be observed and followed by the teachers and transferred after evaluation. \r\n\r\nThe strategies and methods which we agreed upon to apply embody plenty of ideas which stand for a real alternative to solve these four problems. \r\n\r\nBefore creating this project we had a pre-work period about the new strategies and defined 5 new ones to use in our project. Every partner will apply one of these methods in its school environment, observe and evaluate the outcomes. During the meetings these outcomes will be discussed by all the partners and will be transferred to one another. At the end of 2 year time, 5 strategies will have been applied and evaluated. According to the observation and results of success the partners will continue to use these strategies and methods at their schools. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n-to promote the inclusion of excluded students, the ones with lack of basic skills, the risk of dropping out, with special needs by helping to promote their integration into the mainstream education and society. \r\n-to apply new strategies for overcoming social exclusion, lack of basic skills and school drop out\r\n-to conduct new methods in the field of social and emotional child development as part of students with special educational needs' practical curriculum. \r\n-to give teachers different methods of education and share the good practices\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF THE PARTICIPANTS\r\nStudents/teenagers: The project will take excluded  students in the centre, so 180 in total will take part actively in the project activities. Approximately 1200 students/teenagers will be indirectly affected. \r\nTeachers/Adults: there will be teams of 5 teachers at each partner organisation so 30 in total will take an active part in the project. There will be a teacher of English, Maths Teacher, a Counselor, an ICT teacher and a PE teacher/trainer. Approximately 150 teachers/adults will be indirectly affected.\r\nAdministrative staff: The head teacher/chairman and a deputy head will take part in the project, approximately 36 administrative staff will be indirectly affected.\r\nFamilies: The number of the family members will be 300 in total and they will contribute to introduce the host country\u2019s culture, tradition and to prepare traditional food for an international evening. \r\nLocal community: Local community including local press, municipality, directorate of national education and PTA will help to disseminate the project to a wider community.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACTS\r\nThrough our project the five partners intend to create both short-term and long-term tangible and intangible results and to achieve the biggest possible impact on future projects and policy processes such as leading students to overcome lack of self-esteem, setting up the project website in order to provide continuous access to the general information of the project activities, progress and results, writing newspaper reports and creating on-site panels or leaflets to inform other people about the project\u2019s background and main results, arranging a multiplier event, communication, and cognitive skills of students at risk, cultivating effective partnerships between trainers, educators, and community organizations.", "http://www.kingsmooracademy.attrust.org.uk", "Kingsmoor Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036552_coordinator"]]}}}}
