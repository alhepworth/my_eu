At present, the school strives to provide opportunities for all pupils to learn French as a second language from Primaries 1 to 7.  Currently, none of the staff members are confident or trained in the delivery of Spanish.  Attendance at the course would allow the school's language coordinator to acquire the essential skills and knowledge to facilitate the training and development of all teaching staff within our two schools.\r\n\r\nThe delivery of Spanish is a future priority within our School Improvement Plan and an Action Plan will be generated by the Headteacher and school's Language Coordinator.  Part of this work will involve establishing a progressive programme of skills that takes account of the children's ongoing cross-curricular experiences.\r\n\r\nAn evaluation of the Action Plan and the learning and teaching experiences will take place, using formal and informal monitoring procedures.

According to the European Recovery Plan one of the actions that needs to be taken to tackle the current crisis, is investing in energy efficiency. Historic urban buildings consume 4% of all energy and are responsible for 3% of CO2 emissions. Therefore, improving energy efficiency in historic buildings and historic districts is essential.\n\nNevertheless, most of the current developments in energy efficiency address new construction without dealing with the unique problems of historic structures. A number of technologies and products have been developed, however many of the solutions are not acceptable for historic structures due to the necessity of preserving integrity and authenticity.\n\nTherefore, the main goal of EFFESUS is to develop and demonstrate, through case studies a methodology for assessing and selecting energy efficiency interventions, based on existing and new technologies that are compatible with heritage values.  A Decision Support System will be a primary deliverable. The environment in historic buildings and urban districts is controlled differently from modern cities and accordingly the project will also develop a multi-scale data model for the management of energy. In addition, new non-invasive, reversible yet cost-effective technologies for significantly improving thermal properties will also be developed. Finally, existing regulations and building policies may not fit cultural heritage specificities so the EFFESUS project will also address these non-technical barriers.\n\nThese outcomes will be achieved through 10 work packages, performed by an interdisciplinary consortium of 23 partners from 13 countries.

We feel that we have made a very good start to embedding modern language learning in our school and with an increase in general staff confidence, we can ensure further immersion across our curriculum.\r\nThe participants named in this application have varying requirements and objectives for attending a course in France or Spain. We are all in agreement that by visiting these countries and being fully immersed in a programme of study in French or Spanish and experiencing the culture first hand, would be a most valuable and memorable way of inspiring our learners  in the classroom. The other members of staff in Melrose Primary School will also benefit from their experiences and be inspired to engage more fully with language learning. This will have a positive impact on our children across the school as their enthusiasm for, and progress in modern language learning increases. The probationers will be able to disseminate their skills in other Scottish schools.\r\nThe immersion programme fully embraces the key principles of Curriculum for Excellence and so the experiences and knowledge gained by our participants will ensure that our French and Spanish learning programmes will reflect the seven principles of curriculum design. Teachers who have previously attended a course found the materials provided were relevant, accessible and easily utilised.  Consequently pupil engagement, enjoyment and enthusiasm for modern language learning has significantly increased. \r\nThrough native speakers leading these courses, cultural awareness and new ways of teaching modern languages through a variety of media are experienced, in particular through ICT. All participants receive a pen drive which contains the course contents including resources and ideas for exciting and engaging learning activities. These courses also offer invaluable training in the teaching of modern languages to young learners through observing and participating in modelled activities. Another incentive of attending a course is the opportunity to network with colleagues from across Scotland, England and Ireland as well as the host country.

In addition to this the application includes 2 regional Development Officers, with primary and secondary backgrounds,  to take part in Immersion experiences to support developing similar models for training teachers across the Scottish Borders. \r\nThe course activities will include speaking in the target language with native speakers, cross curricular approaches to teaching languages, developing cultural awareness of the countries in which the language is spoken and using ICT to support engaging teaching methods. The selected courses also offer in depth support and training in the teaching of European languages to young learners. Language skills developed will be French and Spanish and used to implement the national, local and school plans to address the Languages 1+2 recommendations from the Scottish Government. \r\nIt is anticipated that the results of this project will improve staff ability and confidence in the teaching of French and Spanish, enhance the learning experience of pupils involved in learning languages, ensuring learners access languages from an earlier stage in their primary schooling and develop capacity in the use of ICT to support linguistic development. The increased skill set of the two development officers will ensure that local opportunities for career long professional learning  is offered to other teachers/schools in the area of language development. \r\nUltimately the longer term benefits will be for learners to raise their attainment in languages, increase the uptake of languages at formally assessed levels in the Scottish Borders and to ensure that Scottish Borders young people are able to access the best opportunities for movement within and across Europe in the future.", "http://www.melroseprimaryschool.org.uk", "Melrose Grammar School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002256_coordinator"]]}}}}
