Each was a pilot school in inGenious, and each has challenging and specific targets that will be fulfilled in this project.  Fairfield High School for Girls is an outstanding school which is developing its international links: currently it is a Go-Lab pilot school and a partner in a Comenius project. IES David Bujan in Spain has a huge experience working with students in virtual and remote laboratories, as well as improving the science learning process through Inquiry Based Science Education method.  Gymnasium \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice is a selective grammar school in the Czech Republic with a focus on the gifted and talented students and has a long experience in video conferencing. IIS Galileo Galilei in Jesi, Italy, has an immense experience in international projects particularly those aimed to develop the students' multilingual skills. A proportion of their students are from low-medium income families and ethnic minority groups. Whereas Orde Chopela in Prilep, Macedonia is a high school that offers academic and vocational study programmes using modern technologies to enhance the curriculum. The participants from all the schools involved will benefit from intercultural peer to peer support, they will develop tolerance and understanding of other cultures and they will develop their scientific and multilingual competences. For this partnership, we have planned an ambitious and challenging project but we believe that it will help to unlock the potential in everyone involved and the activities will stretch their competences and creativity beyond their expectations. Two transnational meetings and five short-term exchange visits are planned for this project. The organisations involved will provide a favourable environment through the European mobility to challenge and extend the more-able students to raise their attainment, empower the students with opportunities to raise their aspirations and overcome economic and social barriers, motivate all stakeholders to engage actively with education and gain cultural, vocational and linguistic benefits and improve their employment outlook in the future.We have chosen the history of the textile industry as a context for this project because the home of each participant shares a common heritage that is still influencing our societies. We believe that we should understand our history to build a better future.Within this context we have planned visits to first class educational and industrial experiences and highly motivating cross-curricular teaching and learning activities with innovative methodologies and effective use of ICT and digital tools . Science inquiry-based learning activity packs will be developed and piloted during the lifetime of the project. The activities will tackle the history of textiles, pollution, recycling, designing products, collecting and recording data, communicating ideas and results effectively using correct language.  Over two years, the participants will continuously work on various tasks in a well structured plan to achieve the results of the project. The outcomes include: a smart material kit, online multilingual voice dictionary, garments made from recycled or reused materials, packs of information cards about pollution and interactive activities and experiments to be used by children at museums. Two intellectual outputs are planned for this project; an illustrated book presenting the results of the activities undertaken and an inquiry-based learning activity pack with accompanying teachers\u2019 guidelines and training DVD. Both products will be disseminated at the final seminar and through channels such as the schools\u2019 and the project websites, eTwinning and Erasmus+ dissemination platform. To maintain sustainability we will continue to offer these products to reach a wider audience outside the partnership through free open access after the project ends. For a good quality of dissemination and exploitation of the project we will monitor the implementation and the impact of the project\u2019s outcomes very closely. The activities will have measurable and realistic objectives and all must adhere to a timetable and the deadlines.  We will use and record qualitative and quantitative indicators to monitor all aspects of the project. We will use pupils, teachers, and families\u2019 voice through feedback questionnaires and reviews of stakeholders. In the framework of the project we plan to embed a clear timetable for physical and virtual meetings between the project coordinators and among the core teams of participants at local level where impact can be monitored. Also, the required official reports and post mobility progress report will inform the management team on the course of action to maximise the visibility of the project and enhance the quality of dissemination and exploitation of the results.", "http://www.fairfieldhigh.tameside.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-CZ01-KA219-023981_1"]]}}, "6AF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Embrassant Fran\u00e7ais en Masse/ Embracing French on Mass", "Fairfield Road Primary School", 7444.0, 1, 1, "This project relates to a larger than average primary school in the North West of England.

This has resulted in a mutually beneficial project which aims to improve and develop teaching in both settings. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to develop teachers understanding of the customs and culture in our partner school in order to enhance our delivery of Spanish as a Modern Foreign Language. The involvement of our MFL coordinator in conjunction with our International Coordinator and a Strategic International Group will ensure a long term impact on the curriculum. \r\n\r\nWe also hope to observe the creative use of performing arts to enhance the curriculum in order to inspire pupils. These methods will be analysed to see if they would have an impact on the curriculum delivery at Moorside.\r\n\r\nIn return, our Spanish partners hope to observe how we at Moorside use ICT to enhance and support the curriculum. They are also interested in the way we gain pupil attention and generate calm learning environments. This will enable our participants to develop their coaching skills by sharing methods with their Spanish colleagues. \r\n\r\nWe intend to involve 8 members of staff in traveling to our partner school. However, presuming our partner school are also successful, many more staff will become involved in the project as a whole due to Moorside hosting Spanish staff and working alongside them.

Furthermore we want to integrate the cooperation with European partner organizations as a permanent part into our school concept and to push forward the internationalization process of our institution.\r\nOur aim is to establish in our everyday school life alternative forms of judging pupils\u00b4 performances as well as discussions about the progress of each child. This year we had such kind of discussions for the first time, whereas other European countries are already used to that. The two selected partner schools in Great Britain and South Tyrol already possess a profound knowledge in this field. During a job shadowing we want to benefit of their experience and gain a profound insight into judging pupils\u00b4 performances and discussions about learning progress, which we later can use to improve our own system. In order to be able to communicate competently and purposefully during the job shadowing visit and also with future European partners, the visit of language courses is intended. \r\nTo strengthen and not to overstrain the capacities of the involved organizations we confine ourselves to 5 mobilities and 4 participants (headmistress and 3 colleagues). The colleague taking part in job shadowing like the headmistress, is on the one hand the coordinator of our current Comenius- and the planned Erasmus+ activities. On the other hand she is representative of the new curriculum and spokeswoman of the 1st/2nd class teachers and therefore actively involved in our school development work. The two other participants were selected due to their high motivation and willingness to transfer their gained experience to the staff.\r\nWhile job shadowing in South Tyrol the headmistress will get an overview on school management level about the local school development policy and modern ways of judging pupils\u00b4 performances as well as the organization and realization of meetings with children and their parents to discuss about each child\u00b4s progress. The colleague job shadowing in Great Britain will study the same aspects from a teacher\u00b4s point of view. In order to be able to communicate competently with the English colleagues and to follow the lessons and the conversations with children and parents effortlessly, she will attend a special language course for teachers in advance.\r\nAs a follow up of the two job shadowing visits the staff of our school will be informed in detail about the new experiences and will be actively integrated into the school development process. Together we want to develop and to put into practice alternative forms       of observing pupils and their performance and establish regular meetings with children and their parents to discuss about each child\u00b4s individual progress. On the occasion of a professional exchange with colleagues of other schools in the framework of network meetings of the curriculum representatives, the colleagues of schools in our neighbourhood will also benefit from our experiences abroad and the resulting practice of observing pupils and their performance and of meeting with children and parents to discuss about individual progress. \r\nThe two other colleagues will attend language courses in Great Britain and then transfer their knowledge to the staff within a teacher training. One teacher will focus on the communication with European partners and thus motivate our colleagues to take part in our Comenius- and Erasmus+ activities. The other teacher will emphasize the methodology of teaching English to young learners and thus enhance the professionalization of the English teachers and their lessons at our school. This should contribute to motivate the pupils and to enable them to communicate in English with children at our European partner schools. \r\nThese are our aspired results and effects and the long-term benefits of the present project:\r\nOur school development plan should be affected positively in a sustainable manner. For this purpose we want to establish, on the basis of the knowledge gained abroad, modern forms of observing pupils and their performance and conduct regular meetings with the children and their parents to discuss about pupils\u00b4 progress, basing strongly on the children and including individual learning and development targets. Beside the teachers especially the children and their parents should therefore profit from the project. The increased language skills of the involved teachers will have long-term effects on the professionalization of the English lessons at our school and the further communication with future Erasmus+ partners.
