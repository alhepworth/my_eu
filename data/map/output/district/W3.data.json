It is important for the main social actors, in charge of young people\u2019s professional training, to create new educational paths more targeted and flexible towards modern needs, adaptable to the definition of new matching mechanisms with the labour market. \r\n\r\nT.R.E.N.D. -Targeting Regognition of compEtences and qualificatioNs for inDustry 4.0,was mold out of this context. Its main aim is to reduce the progressive skills mismatch registered within the local sector of the industry 4.0. Beginning from a mobility action , the project aims at achieving important specific objectives, such as: \r\n1. promoting a better matching between education and professional training;\r\n2. encouraging local youth employability and spreading the right competencies required from the industry 4.0;\r\n3. experimenting a learning methodology based on work (WBL);\r\n4. supporting knowledge acquisition along with technical-professional competencies and transversal skills in the reference sector; \r\n5. Promoting transparency and equal recognition of all the competencies acquired through the application of ECVET methodologies and tools.\r\n\r\nT.R.E.N.D. is open to 100 recent graduates (graduated in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018) from Campania region. The ideal candidates would come from Vocational Institutes where they studied informatics, telecommunications, mechanics and ,mechatronics, electrics/ electronics and/or other types of high schools which might have held similar training paths.  The project will give them the opportunity to carry out a professional internship of 180 days (6 months) in foreign companies related to the abovementioned economic sectors and in the following countries: United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Malta and Netherlands, which are pioneering countries in the project main sectors, protagonist of the transformation process above described. \r\nIn order to achieve the previously defined purposes, Glocal, in quality of coordinator, built a national Consortium made up of those main social stakeholders that play an important role within the interconnection process between education and productive system: Regione Campania, Ufficio Scolastico Regionale (USR) together with 10 vocational institues, Federmanager, Confindustria campania, trade unions organizations such as CGIL, CISL E UIL, Fondazione Carisal, in cooperation with foreign receiving organizations and host companies operating  in the industry 4.0.  For its duration, T.R.E.N.D. may produce an important impact at many levels: local, regional and national at the same time, due to the connection between public/private bodies from education and professional training and the representatives of the labour market. They would be connected in a profitable exchange of ideas and best practices, in a debate on possible modalities and promotion strategies as regards the theme of youth employability. After their mobility abroad, the project\u2019s participants will be given a new opportunity of internship at some Italian companies, which already showed availability in hosting the candidates that acquired the most specific skills during their experience abroad. \r\nThe entire local Campania territory will benefit from the growth of its human resources\u2019 abilities and skills. These young resources will be open-minded towards a more European perspective, but at the same time they will contribute to the competitiveness of the local productive system and will feed the innovation power that lies within their territory.  During the follow-up, the general evaluation will measure the impact on the participants in terms of their increased job opportunities (considering the number of job proposals that the participants will receive abroad , that are expected to reach the 25%, and the number of internships/job opportunities they will find at their return within the 6 months following the end of the project, which are expected to reach the 35%).

Despite this, the school has a significant position among the largest schools of the Ostrava region and continues to maintain a high standard of education, as is evidenced by the above-average results its pupils get in national benchmarking tests, which are taken by all of our pupils without exemption, because our goal is an open school that is truly for all children without exception, a totally universal school covering all of the traditional and latest educational and societal demands. \r\nThe \"Green for Europe\" project has built upon the successfully implemented Erasmus+ project from 2014-2016, which was focused mainly on the development of English teaching methods.

Everyone has actively collaborated on past EU projects. They were pre-selected on the basis of their expertise, proven long-term reliability, the results of their work, and their personal initiatives in clearly defining their objectives in accordance with the objectives of the school and of selecting a particular course. They are all active in creating their own digital teaching materials and are interested in participating in the further development of the school and disseminating their acquired knowledge among pupils and the pedagogical public. The selected educators are also actively involved in the development of modern methodology and in the school's inclusive education. Specifically, there is 1 teacher from the lower level, 1 lower-level English teacher, 1 upper-level English teacher, 1 teacher of civic education and history, 1 teacher of computer science and ICT methodology, and 1 representative of the school management, who is also the project manager responsible for communication with foreign organizations.\r\nThe project has been coordinated from the start by the project manager, who is responsible for managing the process of training teachers: from the organization of the project to the final report.

In recent years, the EU has demonstrated strong commitment to sustainable development and its successful incorporation into many of the union policies. Climate change prevention policy and energy policy of the EU are proof of the importance of sustainable development. As regards young people, the idea of \u200b\u200bsustainability implies that economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection must go together and complement each other. The ongoing global economic and financial crisis has shown that sustainable development is crucial to Europe's future. Restoring confidence in the financial system and the stability of the economy is a top priority for reversing the recession and paving the way for sustainable development where employment, social inclusion, investment in skills and technologies are fostered to boost economic growth, achieve long-term prosperity and environmental protection - all the goals of sustainable development in the long run. Current crises represent an opportunity for Bulgaria to move towards an environmentally efficient economy characterized by low carbon emissions and resource efficiency based on sustainable production in all sectors and a more sustainable lifestyle. This will improve the well-being of all citizens while reducing energy consumption and natural resources and minimizing negative impacts on health and the environment, in particular regarding ecosystems and climate change. Based on these identified needs, we define as a priority the role of young people in realizing the above-mentioned goals and opportunities. Taking into account the fact that many young people have great difficulty in integrating professionally because they do not have the social competences required in the work environment, the Sustainable European Future project directs partner organizations to a very serious and worrying problem among young people - social exclusion. In order to limit these risks, we are focusing on developing the \"soft\" skills required by employers.\r\nThe project has three main objectives that are directly related to the three pillars of sustainable development - economic, social and environmental:\r\n1. Economic development - The project aims to increase the competitiveness of young people, including those with fewer opportunities on the European labor market.\r\n2. Social development - The project aims to stimulate intercultural dialogue. It is aimed at building common values \u200b\u200brelated to respect for human rights, respect for other cultures, religions, customs and lifestyles through learning amongst equal partners.\r\n3. Environmental development - The project aims to increase the commitment of young people to the problems related to the conservation of natural resources.\r\nDuring the Sustainable European Future project, 53 young people aged 18-25 will work together to implement the principles of sustainable development, with 28 young people from Bulgaria and 25 from the UK.\r\nThe project will include project management activities, implementation of youth exchanges and dissemination and reporting of project results. The methodology used is based on organizational, management, non-formal learning methods and accounting and analytical methods.\r\nThe main results of the project are related to the defined objectives and are expressed in:\r\n1. Expanding youth employment by increasing the competitiveness of project participants, based on the development of soft skills and the enhancement of key competences in English.\r\n2. Mediating intercultural dialogue through the integration of young people of different nationalities during the exchange and building friendships and solidarity among them.\r\n3. Increasing the commitment of young people to the principles of sustainable development.\r\nThe impact of the project will promote young people's professional development, cultural diversity and mediate tolerance and intercultural exchange, which in turn will help address the social exclusion problems of specific youth groups. The Sustainable European Future project will increase young people's commitment to sustainable development. They will be able to successfully integrate into society and take an active role in the labor market. Collaboration between project partners allows the exchange of good practices.

With reference to this management the focus is on language attitudes and emotions and this for two main reasons:- Multilingual families play a significant and important role in the language learning of the family members and this for all languages concerned (minority languages, heritage languages, languages of integration). Attitudes and emotions influence motivation and the learning of these languages.- Language use in the multilingual family influences the wellbeing of the family members. Multilingual families should be supported to create an optimal environment for language learning and wellbeing. They should create an open atmosphere in which decisions on language maintenance /shift are considered and debatable. They should reinforce the mutual understanding between different generations and a positive approach to anguage learning. This means that they have to become aware of language attitudes and emotions from the different family members. They should be able to handle negative attitudes and reinforce the positive ones. This is a family matter for each multilingual family.Professionals (educators, social/medical workers, teachers etc.) working with multilingual families are confronted with family members who sometimes struggle with the multilingual context that they are living in or who express negative connotations towards the home language and/or language of integration. The negative attitudes influence their wellbeing and/or language learning. These professionals need tools to help clients to express the attitudes and bend them in a more positive direction and this supported by the family. The central tool is an interactive application (app). The app will provide the possibility to the family members (from 6 years on) to input their emotions and ideas concerning the language use at home. Professionals will introduce the use of the tool in the family and support the communication about the outcome. To develop this app the chosen approach is \u201cUser Centered Design\u201d; this means that the stakeholders (families and professionals) will be strongly involved in the process of development. To support the correct use of the app a user guide and short film will be provided.In line with this, a training course for professionals will be developed.

A decline in the interest in democratic processes and institutions among young persons is evident, as well as increased discrimination, racism, political and religious extremism. Furthermore the educational systems across Europe have common problems with absenteeism and drop-out.   \r\nThere is a growing sense of frustration amongst teachers and youth workers concerning the low level of youth participation in democratic processes, as well as young people\u2019s lack of trust in democratic institutions and values. The youth professionals worry about these perceived democratic deficits and the consequences it has for the youngsters and for society in general, which is particularly concerning when it comes to vulnerable youth at risk of being marginalised in society. \r\nAll partner organisations have identified organisational shortcomings concerning youth participation on several levels, both structural and cultural. This leads to a perception amongst youth of not having a say in the decision making, not even on their own personal level at school or in other situations, which in turn leads to distrust and disinterest in partaking in activities organised by established organisations and in democratic processes. The feeling of being marginalised puts the youngsters at risk of actually becoming excluded, and is conductive to discrimination, racism, political and religious extremism, school absenteeism, and drop-out, from school, work or youth programmes.\r\nThe professionals working with young persons between 16 and 25, in particular teachers and youth workers can be perceived as carriers of structures and cultures that perpetuate the identified shortcomings of the organisations. They need new methods and tools to improve their capacity to communicate with youth in a more participatory way, and to understand the importance and impact that their attitude has. There is also a need for structures, methods and tools that will support the democratic institutions ability to reach the concerned youth groups.\r\nThis project aims to provide a basis for an improved culture amongst professionals as well as structures that will support democratic dialogue and youth involvement in order to promote civic participation, create participatory mechanisms, thus preventing marginalisation and its negative effects on individuals and society. \r\nThe objectives are to identify and develop existing methods and tools for youth professionals, design new ones, at least ten altogether, as well as develop two online courses. A further objective is to find possible structural revisions that will facilitate youth participation, such as structures for meetings with decision makers and/or other political arenas. The relevant methods, tools and training tools will be collected and made available in a database that will provide a \u201cPlatform for sharing of good practice in the field of promoting democratic dialogue and youth civic participation\u201d.

The GET THERE project will use two extant programmes to help deliver these outcomes, taking the ASDAN Employability Curriculum from existing qualification units and teaching these through Europeace Youth's innovative Mentoring methodology. This will be carried out in line with research results in each country which will establish which skills are most in demand in each country and, accordingly, which modules to include in GET THERE training programme.\r\nObjects of Project\r\nTo create high-quality Employability training programmes in each partner country; to deliver pilottraining to at least 90 learners across partner countries; to disseminate project content and methodology at local, national and international level.\r\nMethodology\r\nThe methodology for GET THERE is based around two innovative programmes: ASDAN's Employability curriculum and EPY's Youth Mentor Training Course. \r\n\u2022 2 innovative methodologies and tools, Employability Activities  and Mentoring programme, focused on developing real skills for work and business and empowerment competencies development, will be transferred by ASDAN and Europeace Youth. While Employability activities  bring an innovative curriculum on employability skills, Europeace Youth brings a Mentoring model;\r\n\u2022 target groups that will be fit: (i) first the GET THERE project will equip (transfer workshop - learning activity) VET providers with methodologies, tools and competences in order to be the future employability educators and thus speed up employability skills learning among unemployed, in particular those less qualified; (ii) second, end users (the ones to address in the national pilots) will be unemployed people - young or less young - and employed people.\r\n\u2022 1 Competences Matrix for GET THERE training course - which infuse ASDAN's curriculum with EPY's peer mentoring methodology - developed in a learning outcomes approach to clearly define knowledge, skills and competences a trainee should achieve by undertaking the training. This will allow a greater transparency about the qualification and is aligned with ECVET, emphasizing the importance in building mutual understanding and trust between partners and thus improving the quality of mobilites at an European level.\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the GET THERE project is to support the development of employability skills which will equip people for the modern workplace and address EU key competence in the end users defined above, equipping VET providers with methodologies, tools and competences in order to be the future employability educators (i.e., VET teachers/trainers/professional) and thus speed up employability learning among people of a working age in all partners\u2019 countries.\r\n\r\nSome of the main activities will be: Initial meeting and research objectives; a common transfer workshop - learning activitys; national pilot training of about 3; partners meetings; final conference.\r\nIntellectual Outputs\r\n01 - Survey and Assessment of Employability needs - from 2 different perspectives - in each partner country \r\n02 - GET THERE handbook with background, rationale, partner information, project content\r\n03 - Competencies Matrix - Production of matrix detailing learning outcomes with regard to knowledge, skills and competences, to facilitate criteria, assessment, recognition of learner outcomes\r\n04 - Guideline to successfully implement Get There project results in other organisations.\r\nParticipant Profile\r\nThe GET THERE project consortium includes 6 partners that work VET, ISQ (PT), IEKEP (EL) and ASDAN (UK), INFODEF (ES), CARDET (CY) and EPY (UK), all of whom have worked on European projects. Each partner organisation will look to deliver training to unemployed people or people that have a job but want to improve their skills - those who are need of employability training but also those in danger of becoming unemployed or already in this category.\r\nResults & Impact Envisaged\r\nBesides the 90 pilot training participants, it is expected to have 240 people participating in the initial survey and at least 125 in the multiplier event.\r\nPotential benefits\r\nEach partner country will have access to high quality curriculum material and an effective learning methodology which can be accessed freely by other national organisations and delivered to large numbers of people looking to develop real employability skills. Our choice of innovative learning materials ensures that the programme is engaging and informative for future learners and will allow them to access training which will aid their journey into employment.\r\nFinal report & Summary\r\nAll work completed during the programme and full evaluation work will be completed as part of a comprehensive final project report and summary.", "http://www.europeaceyouth.org", "ASDAN", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013608_1"]]}}, "8DG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Well mind in a well body", "London Borough of Ealing (Bollo Brook Youth Centre)", 13154.0, 4, 4, "Project \"Well mind in a well body\" brings together youngsters from Estonia, Romania, England and Portugal.

Fault is defined as any deterioration of the functional profile of informational system, the volumetric profile, and  the security profile<br/>- Support for a reconfiguration as an efficient system<br/>The primary objective of GEMOM is to research, develop and deploy a prototype of a messaging platform that is evolutionary, self-organising, self healing, scalable and secure. GEMOM will be resilient and be able to utilise redundant modules (hot-swap or switchover) instantly without information loss. These resilience features will allow specialist, independent system actors, viz. watch-dogs, security and situation monitors, routers, and other optimisers, to remove or replace compromised nodes from the broader network instantly without compromising higher level functionality.<br/>GEMOM considers the Publish-Subscribe variant of Message Oriented Middleware to be the predominant one and will focus on issues surrounding that kind of messaging. For completeness GEMOM would provide a synchronous Request and Reply overlay as well. <br/>The advances that GEMOM proposes to make to the area of messaging revolve around the notion of a 'fault'.
