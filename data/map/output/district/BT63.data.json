The aim of the project is to contribute towards the development of solutions for issues related to e.g. youth unemployment and living in unsafe communities that young people deal with internationally. The underlying assumption is that young people need a safe, inclusive and enabling environment to realize their full potential  (and be the future drivers of positive change within their communities). Herein the project specifically focusses on central role of community sport coaches.  The general objective of the project is to create a safe, inclusive and enabling environment for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds through high-quality training of community sport coaches, focusing on sport as a tool to manage conflict, acquire lifeskills and facilitate entrepreneurship. More specifically the objective is to develop an internationally recognised standard for community sport coaches, 'sport for community building, youth development & entrepreneurship', and the development of a strategic partnership wherein a variety of organisations participate and jointly work together initiating new tools and techniques that community sport coaches can use in their current and future work. Characteristic is the holistic approach, with the community sport coach positioned at the centre. It is the community sport coach that works on a daily basis with disadvantaged youth. Additionally, they possess a unique tool \u2013 sport \u2013 \u2018that can unite people in a way that little else does\u2019. However, thus far, many community sport coaches are not yet able to make use of the full potential that sport has (as a tool). As a result of the project internationally recognised and relevant curriculum will be developed and community coaches will receive high-quality training (including practical tools and techniques) about the instrumental role sport can play within their communities. The strategic partnership is formed by a variety of experts ISA, Oikos, Unify Solutions, University of Bedfordshire. Through different workshop and training settings the strategic partnership develops a curriculum for community sport coaches focusing on three themes: a) Sport & Life skills, b) Sport & Conflict management, c) Sport & Entrepreneurship. Curriculum will be developed both for the training of community sport leaders as well for the training of youth. Based on the developed curriculum three different trainings will be organized for 20 community sport coaches. Wherein each training will focus on a different theme. During the final phase of the project several multiplier events will be organised to disseminate the developed expertise and present the new curriculum. The most important result of the project is the development of curriculum that community sport coaches can use when organising structural activities for disadvantaged youth.

Firstly, chronic  EU obesity figures (OECD) show that more than half (52%) of the adult population in the EU is overweight or obese.  Secondly, food poverty is on the rise in Europe.  2013 statistics show that 116 million Europeans are now at risk of poverty or social exclusion and 40 million are suffering from severe material deprivation. It is acknowledged that the cheapest food is the unhealthiest food.  These 2 clear challenges represent enterprise opportunities for Food SMEs across the EU to innovate to develop healthier, affordable food and new food distribution channels.   However, these SMEs have been slow to respond as they report they do not have the professional capacity or skills base to innovate/orchestrate change in the entrepreneurship, development, production & marketing of \u201chealthier food\u201d.  \r\n  \r\nThus DECREE has 3 clear and simple objectives:\r\n\r\n1. To develop a toolkit to assist & train regional stakeholders to create a Healthy Food Regional Partnership. This toolkit is called the \"Healthy Food Partnership Toolkit\" and will comprise a programme of learning actions and guidance on how to create a healthy food region.\r\n\r\n2. To create a set of open educational resources to be delivered via an online course for Food SME Owners & Employees. This course is called \u201cCreative ways to produce, market and distribute healthy food\u201d and will focus on teaching Owners and employees how to implement greater innovation and creativity in their business.\r\n\r\n3. To test an innovative industry based employability training module with a cohort of young unemployed.  This will be industry based learning delivered by Food SME Owners through providing practical placements for learners who will acquire new skills for new employment/self employment. \r\n\r\nThe main focus of the project is to provide innovative, easily accessible and career-oriented continuing VET (C-VET) for employees, employers, independent Food entrepreneurs.   However, to provide applied knowledge to the partnership one adult education strand is included providing an opportunity for unemployed young people in competence development.  We focus specifically on how a VET response can be applied in a regional food sector economy.   Why a regional approach? A creative entrepreneurial regional food economy can have profound implications for sustainable economic development. Healthy foods with low food miles represent a very tangible economic opportunity which could reward rural agricultural communities and food firms that can produce healthy, affordable and accessible food products.\r\n\r\nAs a result of our project, the 150 learners (100 Employees in Food SMEs and 50 unemployed young people) who participate in the  'Creative Ways to Produce, Market & Distribute Healthy Foods' course and the \u201cApplied industry learning opportunities\u201d will grow confident in their understanding and application of creativity and innovation as relevant to the Food Businesses and will improve the competitiveness of the Business or become self-employed entrepreneurs or gain employment within the food Industry, because their skills and knowledge are more suited. \r\n\r\nA particularly innovative aspect of our proposal is the creation of five Healthy & Creative Food Region Partnerships. This new strategy involves bringing together stakeholders in the food sector, enterprise support, education and economic development - such as VET providers, universities & colleges, food representative bodies, enterprise development agencies and local authorities) - to jointly explore the structural issues behind improving levels creativity and innovation in Food SMEs, inventory existing resources and commit to collaborative actions to address these issues in a DECREE  Action Plan.

Currently, at least 70 clinical trials are underway to test several different IGF-IR kinase inhibitors and blocking antibodies.
