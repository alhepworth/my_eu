The sector employs over two million people. However, England has the greatest share of the sector\u2019s workforce (83%).  This sector employs a young workforce with 13% of staff aged 16-19 and a further 18% aged 20-24. In the various core occupations of the industry such as kitchen assistance, chefs , hotel managers, travel guides to name a few there is a skills shortage.17 % of the sector establishments report having vacancies, 22 % of which are hard to fill. 66 % of these vacancies are hard-to-fill because applicants lack the required skills. 50 % of employers report that applicants lack customer handling skills, 47% say team working skills are lacking, 43% oral communication skills and 39 % believe applicants lack problem solving skills. Labour turnover for the whole sector stands at around 31%.Based on average expenditure on recruitment and initial training this costs the sector around \u00a333.4m per year .11 % of the workforce do not hold any qualifications, 7% of hotel and accommodation managers and 7% of restaurant managers have no qualifications at all. At the skilled trade level, 10% of chefs have no qualifications. 26 % of businesses in the sector report they have staff who are not fully proficient to meet the needs of their business. Employers most commonly offer informal training to their staff with introductory/induction training also frequently available. Large operators are much more likely to provide training. Training is infrequent and not consistent. This project will help potential employers with preparation of the future workforce training. A residential study visit is often the highlight of the course for learners. It presents them with the opportunity to study travel and tourism outside the classroom in a real-life situation. Working and learning within  a hotel organisation will give the students the skills they need to prepare them for employment in the travel and tourism industry.  As well as giving students the chance to experience the subject first hand and to build on knowledge gained during delivery of other units, it promotes team building and independent living. For some students, this may be their first experience of traveling without their family or close friends, especially as the study visit will take place outside the UK. The work experience unit is linked closely to the student\u2019s programme of study and as such incorporates ECVET and Europass learning principles. The number of students this project will impact on will be a total of 45. Students will identify roles, duties and responsibilities of different categories of holiday representatives-Social skills e.g. creating rapport, providing a welcome; and providing a helpful and friendly service. They will demonstrate Customer service skills e.g. meeting customer needs, dealing with queries, providing information for handling complaints and finding solutions. They will communicate with groups and individuals e.g.. using visual aids and body language. Other situations that students will be part of include: handling complaints e.g. over-bookings, standard of accommodation etc. All the information will be collected with the aid of a personal Logbook that students will have and also it will form part of their Europass Mobility record of achievement and ECVET. Finally, learners will undertake an evaluation of the success of the study visit including their own contribution and present to the school and their peers. This information will then be disseminated to all staff and to the wider district via the Local Education Authority. The impact of this project will mean that students will acquire the necessary skills needed to work in the travel industry and thus close the skills gap the industry current has. It will give them the training and knowledge to become an effective employee and team player in a business organisation. Furthermore, the experience will be accredited which means the students will have a qualification that not only recognizes their experience but also the new found skills gained .

During the placements, contact will be held by Etwinnings but also email and telephone are possible means of communication to be able to act quickly and be able to react spontaneously in cases of emergencies.  Extremely important for the success of a mobility is its preparation. These are going to be mainly proceeded by the employees of the vocational school in Oldenburg. A special focus here lies on language and communication skills of the trainees because these are fundamental for the concerned persons to get along easily in a foreign country and to feel well there.   The short-, middle- and long-term results are going to be most fundamental for the concerned trainees. Through the vast extension of social and professional competences as well as the development of further language and cultural skills this is going to have a huge direct and long-lasting impact on many aspects of their future personal and professional lives. The experiences made will also result in an enormously high additional value for the concerned institutions which is going to have consequences which reach far into the future and will give the opportunity to many more apprentices to collect experiences in foreign countries for being more open for Europe and to gain better career opportunities on the European labour market.", "http://www.sbsj.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-002098_2"]]}}, "4SA": {"creative": {"data": [[1414800000000, 1490918400000, "Crossing The Line", "MIND THE GAP", 155815.0, 3, 3, "We have created Crossing The Line to a) learn from each other and strengthen our own practice, and b) share the assets of this experience and learning with others, including organisations who work with learning disabled artists, at earlier stages in their development.

MeDALL (Mechanisms of the Development of Allergy) aims at generating novel knowledge on mechanisms of allergy initiation, in particular in childhood. To understand how a complex network of genetic and environmental factors leads to complex allergic phenotypes, a novel stepwise, large and integrative translational approach is needed. MeDALL includes experts in allergy, epidemiology, genetics, immunology, biology, animal models, biochemistry and systems biology combining strengths of ongoing EU projects. Classical phenotypes (expert-based) and novel phenotypes of allergy (hypothesis-free statistical modelling) are compared.  Population-based data are collected from a cross-sectional study (Karelia) and existing birth-cohorts followed using a common protocol. IgE to foods and inhalants are tested using component-resolved diagnosis across Europe in populations. Biomarker profiles (\u201cfingerprints\u201d) are extensively assessed using epigenetics, targeted proteomics and unbiased transcriptomics in a subsample of the study population.

It is expected to be revolutionised by the widespread introduction of LED solid state technology. However, LED technology has some major problems to overcome on the delivered efficiency of multi-LED lights, cost, and the quality of the light colour produced.\n\nHERCULES will produce solutions for LED lighting for a range of applications. It will build on a successfully demonstrated concept that combines the light from different LED sources to produce near perfect colour rendition at colour temperatures as low as 2500K. HERCULES will provide the normal benefits of LED lighting \u2013 high electrical energy to light conversion efficiency (reducing energy consumption), instant start-up and efficient dimmability, but will also allow tuneable colour rendering for applications such as food retailing.\n\nIt is essential that light sources produce high quality colour rendition, which has proved critical to the health and productivity of workers. High efficiency LEDs have very poor colour rendering and current approaches use multiple phosphors on each LED to generate a poor typically \u201cblue rich\u201d approximation to natural light. These phosphors can seriously reduce the efficiency of the LED, so more LEDs are required to achieve the light ouput. In a compact light source this has the effect of increasing the temperature of the LEDs, which has a very negative feedback as their efficiency decreases rapidly with temperature.
