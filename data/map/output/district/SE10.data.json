In the specification phase, we perform a wide meta-analysis of both user needs and existing technological solutions, coupled with case-studies of needs and technologies for four targeted use cases. In the innovation phase, we develop the modular design concept; combining theoretical approaches, cross-fertilisation of methods from other industries (mostly rail and automotive), deep maritime experience in the relevant areas (including hull design, propulsion and electric power systems) and heavy involvement by operators (including three as consortium partners). The concept is applied to, and refined through, four demonstrators: Two ferries, a workboat and a vessel for goods traffic on inland waterways. At least one of the demonstrators will be physically built, co-financed by Rogaland County Council and its transport subsidiary Kolumbus, and used to operate a multi-stop commuter route into Stavanger. It will be a fully electric fast passenger ferry, operating in a region that is a substantial exporter of hydropower. In the replication phase, we will further validate the concept through five additional demonstrators (planning and simulation level) together with operators that did not participate in the details of the first two phases.

The content and length of the Mobility Placements has been designed to meet the career development aims of our Level 3 learners in these sectors, the majority of whom will have completed a Level 2 qualification and have some experience in entry level roles but are looking to move into more senior and better paid roles within their chosen field.\r\n\r\nThe ERASMUS+ project will also deliver the following complementary objectives that support the overall aim of enhancing the employability of our Level 3 learners within the target sectors:\r\n\r\nSUPPORTING CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC DEVELOPMENT: In addition to developing their vocational and workplace skills, Mobility Placements offer a transformational life experience for our learners, many of whom will have had limited opportunities to travel abroad and may not have had the experience of living and working in another country. Learners placed in Spain and Portugal will benefit from supported language development in these placements.\r\n\r\nENHANCING OUR VOCATIONAL PROVISION: Integration of Mobility Placements within our vocational courses will enhance our provision for the target sectors. In particular, working with employers in Spain, Portugal and Ireland will help to introduce European dimensions within the curricula of the courses linked to Mobility Placements and will broaden the perspectives of both tutors and learners.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPING OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH EMPLOYERS: Twin already has excellent links with local and regional employers and the work undertaken in developing this application has already enabled us to establish partnerships with employers within the hospitality industry in Spain, Portugal and Ireland.\r\n\r\nLEARNERS\r\nProject learners will be VET learners currently undertaking, or having recently completed, Level 3 vocational qualifications related to the hospitality sector and the specific courses where we propose to offer mobility opportunities to learners are:\r\n\r\n- ILM Level 3 Certificate in Principles of Leadership and Management\r\n- City & Guilds Level 3 Award in Principles of Website Creation and Optimisation\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nThe core activities that the ERASMUS+ project will deliver will be 105 mobility work placements within the hospitality sector in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The 105 placements will be split with 48 travelling to Spain, 12 to Portugal and 45 to Ireland. \r\n\r\nThe project will work with 36 Host Employers, which will facilitate effective matching of mobility work placement opportunities with the learning aims and career development aspirations of our learners. In addition to providing work experience for the learners, Host Employers will contribute to other key functions, including recruitment and selection, preparation and post placement support. \r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe methodologies adopted by the ERASMUS+ project will focus on working in partnership with Host Employers in the destination countries that have the experience, expertise, organisational capacity and range of business activities that will support our learners in developing experience-acquired skills for their vocational area by working alongside established professionals in their chosen field. Working with such a broad range of Host Employers will mean that no two placements will be exactly the same but they have been designed to both enable learners to put the skills learned during their VET courses into practice and to take on additional responsibility and adapt to more senior roles within the workplace.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT\r\nThe project will deliver major impacts for the learners in terms of job outcomes and career development. We expect that 73% will enter employment within 3 months of completing their mobility and, of those, 81% will sustain employment for at least 6 months. We also expect the project to benefit the labour market mobility of learners and expect at least 11% to take up jobs in other EU countries. \r\n\r\nThe project will build the capacity of partners to participate in transnational activities in general and the Erasmus+ programme in particular.

The aim of the project is to strengthen intercultural competence and to further develop linguistic skills. Furthermore, personal, social and professional skills should be developed. As a result of globalization, such skills have become essential for future employees to be able to compete on the European market. A total of 600 participants will travel to the UK in groups of at least 10. The project consists of prior preparation in Germany and a three-week learning period in Great Britain. Participants are provided with a cultural and work-related introduction in the UK. Participants complete industrial internships in small and medium-sized enterprises in England. In all internships, participants are given the opportunity to interact with customers allowing for targeted use and improvement of their language skills. Participants also have the chance to take part in cultural activities outside of the internship.

This should improve their employment outlook and initiate an interest in international mobility at the beginning of their professional career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject A5:\r\n\r\nThis project is designed for thirty graduates from hotel and catering traineeships. Participants will undertake a four-month learning period abroad consisting of a specialist internship and an introductory course in the UK.

On another level we intend to improve the social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migrant background or are disadvantaged learners.\r\n\r\nThe following are the two MAIN activities we will offer the youths mentioned above:\r\n\r\n- internships abroad\r\n\r\n- project work abroad related to participants' vocational field \r\n\r\nMost of the participating youths will be from the following fields: clerical occupations, media, hotel, gastronomy, carpenters/joiners.\r\n\r\nThese main activities will supported by the following FLANKING activities offered to professionals  from vocational training centers in Berlin: \r\n\r\n- Preparatory Visits abroad (e. g. to prepare mobility flows)\r\n\r\n- Training for professionals covering the topics \r\n\r\no \u201eThe European Job Market \u2013 a challenge for local vocational training centers?\u201c \r\n\r\n(also for professionals with a lower foreign language proficiency level, 4 day course)\r\n\r\no \u201eEuropean Training and Instructing Traditions - Learning from the Best in the Field\u201c (for professionals with a higher foreign language proficiency level, 7 day course)\r\n\r\nFurther FLANKING activities will be offered to student teachers in Berlin:\r\n\r\n- \u201eImproving the European and Mobility competence in teacher training\u201c (7-day course)\r\n\r\nOur GoEurope mobility network encompasses 40 different partner organizations in 17 EU countries  plus Turkey. All of our partners are specialized in the professional execution of Erasmus+ (formerly Leonardo-da-Vinci)-funded internship and project-work stays abroad . Most of them can draw on a network of hundreds or more internship companies. They are well connected with the vocational training centers and political institutions  in their respective regions. \r\n\r\nAs soon as the decisive parameters of a mobility flow have been defined together with the local training institution the project is actively promoted to the defined target group. As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. \r\n\r\nThe desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migration background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development. Furthermore, we intend to create excitement for the European Union in general amongst satisfied participants! All of them can be instrumental in internationalizing their educational institutions. Particularly by helping to create a functional network between the body responsible for the project and local partner organizations. \r\n\r\nOur network has been growing for nine years now and the long-term effects of our steady growth in terms of quality and numbers of participants are becoming ever more evident. By now 15 Berlin vocational training centers have already appointed an EU-Affairs Representative to manage their collaboration with us. Two vocational training centers now even offer vocational training courses with integrated mobility stays abroad. For our EUROPASS mobility ceremonies we are often honored to have undersecretaries of state personally handing over the certificates to our proud young participants.\r\n\r\nA development towards an innovation and internationalization cluster including our local, national and international partners is becoming ever more visible. Junior and Senior Management as well as EU-Affairs Representatives are exchanging experiences and inspiring each other in their efforts towards enhanced employability of the youth.\r\n\r\nLast but not least close to 500 youths come back home - excited about their mobility experience abroad.

The content and length of the Mobility Placements has been designed to meet the career development aims of our Level 3 learners in these sectors, the majority of whom will have completed a Level 2 qualification and have some experience in entry level roles but are looking to move into more senior and better paid roles within their chosen field.\r\n\r\nThe EMCD project will also deliver the following complementary objectives that support the overall aim of enhancing the employability of our Level 3 learners within the target sectors:\r\n\r\nSUPPORTING CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC DEVELOPMENT: In addition to developing their vocational and workplace skills, Mobility Placements will offer a transformational life experience for our learners, many of whom will have had limited opportunities to travel abroad and certainly will not have lived and worked in another country.\r\n\r\nENHANCING OUR VOCATIONAL PROVISION: Integration of Mobility Placements within our vocational courses will enhance our provision for the target sectors. In particular, working with employers in Spain and Ireland will help to introduce European dimensions within the curricula of the courses linked to Mobility Placements and will broaden the perspectives of both tutors and learners.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPING OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH EMPLOYERS: Twin already has excellent links with local and regional employers and the work undertaken in developing this application has already enabled us to establish partnerships with employers within the target sectors in Spain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nProject participants will be VET learners currently undertaking or having recently completed Level 3 vocational qualifications related to the hospitality and language teaching sectors and the specific courses where we propose to offer mobility opportunities to learners are:\r\n\r\n-  ILM Level 3 Certificate in Principles of Leadership and Management\r\n-  City & Guilds Level 3 Award in Principles of Website Creation and Optimisation\r\n-  LRN Level 3 Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nThe core activities that the EMCD project will deliver will be 90 mobility work placements within the hospitality and language teaching sectors in Spain and Ireland.  We intend to deliver the 90 mobilities in the 3 groups of 30, with each group being broken down as follows: 14 Leadership and Management (8 to Spain, 6 to Ireland), 8 Digital Media to Spain and 8 TEFL to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe project will work with 27 Host Employers, which will facilitate effective matching of mobility work placement opportunities with the learning aims and career development aspirations of our participants. In addition to providing work experience for the participants, Host Employers will contribute to other key functions, including recruitment and selection, preparation and post placement support.  \r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe methodologies adopted by the EMCD project will focus on working in partnership with Host Employers in the destination countries that have the experience, expertise, organisational capacity and range of business activities that will support our learners in developing experience-acquired skills for their vocational area by working alongside established professionals in their chosen field.  Working in different sectors and with such a broad range of Host Employers will mean that no two mobilities will be exactly the same but they have been designed to both enable participants to put the skills learned during their VET courses into practice and take on additional responsibility and adapt to more senior roles within the workplace.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT\r\nThe project will deliver major impacts for the participants in terms of job outcomes and career development.

In this way, we ensure that the internships will form a natural part of the students\u2019 HTX training in accordance with the legal requirement: BEK nr. 740 af 23/06/2010 \u00a729 which requires some teaching to be provided in a work place context.  These study programmes are GLOBALTECH, MEDIATECH, Experience Design and Emergency Services. The partners in the project will complete a Learning Agreement before the student\u2019s departure. The students participate in three- or four-week internships in London or Barcelona depending on the study line  during 2nd or 3rd Year. London and Barcelona have been chosen because of the opportunities to add to the profile of the study lines a new and innovative approach to the subject\u2019s traditions and teaching environments with communication, IT and Design as well as improving the students\u2019 English language skills. In Barcelona English will also be the work language for most internships. The objectives for the students are:\r\n\u2022 That they develop their professional, intercultural and personal skills in such a way that they can be part of a globalized labor- and educational market later in their education.\r\n\u2022 That students become familiar with and gain an understanding of the requirements for the individual working in a globalized labor market.\r\n\u2022 That students upon their return can provide new and innovative approaches to subjects taught at AATG.\r\nGenerally, we assess the skills of HTX students as being adequate for a course of this character and length, the students are between 17 and 19 years old. We will carry out a three-part assessment to ensure the best implementation and placement in a company and host family. Based on previous experience, we expect to send off about 90-95% of the students in the classes, which are part of the project. \r\nTeacher mobility. The objective for employee/ teacher mobility is:\r\n- That the teachers develop their knowledge and pedagogic approach within their own subject through observation and participation in work placement with companies and job shadowing at education institutions in language teaching, design, technology and communication technical study lines.\r\n- That the teachers develop their own knowledge and understanding of what is required of the students in a globalized labor market.\r\n- That the teachers upon their return may add to the study lines new and innovative approaches to the subjects. \r\nThe participants in this project are students and teachers from study lines, which have an increased focus on both internationalization, the global labor market and interaction with companies.\r\nThe purpose of the mobility project is therefore aimed at several levels: special academic development and fulfillment of targets, practical experience and knowledge of companies, development of personal, linguistic and intercultural skills for student/ teacher and fulfillment of the College\u2019s strategic internationalization strategy.  \r\nIt has been agreed that the distribution of responsibility and roles among the participants in the project is as follows: \r\nAATG: Project management, practical and educational planning. Completing assessment. Organizing stays and transport. TWIN-UK/ Venga Travel: Participate in assessment for internships. Responsible for contracts with companies. Arrange accommodation including food, local transport, supervision and teaching in English/ Spanish.\r\nThe project will be implemented two times with each time lasting one year and with a total of ten student flows. At the same time, nine teacher flows will take place.Throughout the project the following management documents will be used: Contract, Learning Agreement, Europass CV, Language Europass as well as Europass Mobility certificate. The students use Online Language Assessment and a Europass Mobility Certificate will be issued for students at end of their internship.", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA116-034115_2"], [2018, "From education to the labour market 4", "Twin Training International Ltd", 261101.0, 11, 20, "It is the declared goal for Mercantec to give as many students as possible an international experience in the course of their edcation. Mercantec is working continuesly to improve the mobilities in order to give the students the best possible experiences and a strenghting of their education. Mercantec has kept the partners from the application submitted in 2017 but also bringing in new partners to broaden the selection of educations and to include as many departments as possible. Among these new partner there is a spanish partner M.E.P. Europrojects Granada for our IT students and IES Cotes Baixes for our EUX students and this partner will also send students to Mercantec.\r\nMercantec sends students from every department of the school. Higher Business Gymnasium sends a class to Malaga for work placements and language courses. From the hotel and restaunt school, mercantec sends students to Malloca, Hungary, Hennef, rakvere and Cypres. The students come from GF2 and the practice center. House of Technology sends students from the practice center for IT supporter and Data technician to Granada and Neum\u00fcnster. HOT has a cooperation with Grundfos, LEGO and B&O where students from these companies are sent to ABB and Neum\u00fcnster. Auto Technical Center sends students from the practice center to Neum\u00fcnster, Troisdorf, mallorca, Westport and Rakvere. Metalcraft sends students form the practice center to Neum\u00fcnster, Mallorca and Ireland. Higher Technical Gymnasium will have visitors from Galway Ireland and also visit the irish school, with the intent build a mobility relationship for Game design. The construction school sends carpeters, painters and concrete workers to Hennef, Mallorca, Iceland and P\u00e4rnuu. These students come from the practice center, GF2 and main courses. The Business School sends students from the practice center and EUX to London, Mallorca, Ireland and we are working on a futur cooperation with two school from Ireland (Galway and Kerry), as well as sending students from the practice center to Portugal.\r\nErasmus+ mobilities is the corner stone for Mercnatec's international work. The program enable us to give the most number of students an international scope on their education. Our experience is that our students come home with many positive experiences from their mobilities and they are willing to participate in new mobilities. Our experience is that more and more students are asking about the danish PIU (Pratice abroad) programme. \r\nWe expect that there will be an introduction fase and we are palnning to visit the new partners before sending students. Mercantec has a goal to develop Erasmus+ mobilities which are longer than 3 weeks, and a new partner in Portugal has this oppotunity. This partner has a cooperation with two companies, which would be able to host business students for 7 weeks. We know that we might have a challenge with finding the students but nevertheless  we know that the students would like these longer lasting placements.\r\nWe plan to visit our German partners in June 2018. This visit is to improve our relationship and explore possible future areas of cooperation. The participants on this trip is the heads of educations from the individual departments as well as the head of the international department and the international coordinator. Another goal for the trip is to explore the possiblity of finding PIU placemnts for Danish students in Germany. The focus is on VET and EUX students. A visit to the Xarxa partner Munich is also palnned for 2018.\r\nMercnatec is a member of the Xarxa FP which is a cooperation between cities in Europa and their VET schools. We are working on a cooperation with Alcoi in Spain for both KA1 an KA2. The cooperation with Alcoi has resulted in two PIU placements, in which Danish students are doing work experience in Spanish companies. Mercantec is already welcoming students from Xarxa partners and therefore there is a big future potential in developing Mercantec's Erasmus+ mobilities. \r\nWe are sending a teacher along on mobilities due to the fact that most of our students are coming from the practice centers and these students are not the most ressourcefull students. A lot of them has never travelled for longer periods before. It therefore nessesary to send a teacher along to secure the success for the student in order to make future international experiences possible. This is in line woith our international strategy to send 30 students per year on PIU work placements.\r\nMercantec applies for 6 mobilities in ErasmusPRO. We plan to offer these mobilities to students who finish their education and thereby give them the oppotunity to add an international dimension to their education.

As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.  The project is therefore the result of co-operation between the consortium and its partners, and its design and structure reflect this co-operation in terms of the organisation and management of the project, in terms of the selection and preparation of the participants, the supervision of the mobilities, the evaluation, certification and validation of the skills acquired, and the dissemination of the results.

Our experience is that more and more students are asking about the danish PIU (Pratice abroad) programme. \r\nWe have, to optimize our selection of partners and thereby educations, been to a contact seminar in Dublin with the danish NA, where we were able to amke some very good new contacts. these new contacts/partners have been added to this application. We expect that there will be an introduction fase and we are palnning to visit the new partners before sending students. Mercantec has a goal to develop Erasmus+ mobilities which are longer than 3 weeks, and a new partner in Portugal has this oppotunity. the partner has a cooperation with two companies, which would be able to host business students for 7 weeks. We know that we might have a challenge with finding the students but nevertheless  we know that the students would like these longer lasting placements.\r\nWe plan to visit our German partners in February/March. This visit is to improve our relationship and explore possible future areas of cooperation. The participants on this trip is the heads of educations from the individual departments as well as the head of the international department and the international coordinator.

The Humpis-Schule itself wants to be perceived as a competent partner for companies in the field of international commitments and improve its attractiveness accordingly. The participating training companies aim to get more competent and mature employees. The students should be strengthened in their attitudes to European society and should be prepared to be mature and responsible citizens. These qualifications and competences, especially in form of the Europass Mobility should help them with their career. Overall, the stay of young people in other European countries should give insights into all areas of life and thus advance the European integration and, in particular, to ensure peace in the long term.\r\nThe planning, preparation, implementation, evaluation, documentation and support of the project are carried out by the international team of the Humpis-Schule Ravensburg in cooperation with experienced partner institutions. Therefore, a concept has been worked out: participant preparation, evaluation of results, a continuous process of change and improvement. Additionally the interested public will be continuously informed about the activities. The Humpis-Schule and its project partners shall be perceived as competent and future-oriented partners in training questions. Erasmus+ and the European Union as their supporters shall be shown positively. Besides, the dual system of education is to be strengthened as foreign training periods strengthen the attractiveness of the vocational education and show it as an attractive alternative to University training.\r\nIn addition, 10 teachers of the Humpis-Schule will, by means of a short stay, combined with visits of companies and discussions with education experts, take an international view into their lessons, as multipliers will also help other teachers make these findings available, help to formulate learning outcomes (ECVET) and improve their own linguistic proficiency.", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003608_1"], [2018, "Explore Europe 2018-2019", "Twin Training International Ltd", 116607.0, 7, 9, "The project \"Explore Europe 2018- 2019\" enables young people during or immediately after the end of their training to do an internship.

The aims of the project for the students comprise the following aspects: Deepening and expanding practical and theoretical skills gained in the apprenticeships and at vocational school / professional school by applying them in an English company. Acquiring knowledge about British economy and in particular about the sector of the internship company. Getting to know the English culture and way of life. Gaining an insight into regional economic developments and their history in the London area or the Devon region, respectively.

Proof of intercultural skills and experiences are gaining increasingly importance for the successful transfer into employment. This is especially true for the service sector and skilled craft and trade related sector as well - which are the occupations of our target group. But in cause of the socio-economic situation of our target group  those young people do face considerable obstacles when it comes to the acquisition of work experience abroad. There is considerable danger for them that this lack of opportunity and hence experience and key skills will result in a life defining disadvantage and / or exclusion regarding future job chances.In most cases, a stay abroad holds especially for young people with precarious socio-economic background the first opportunity to try and develop an indipendent lifestyle out of the framework of their family and social structures. Following the feedback of those who benefit from work related international exchange programmes, those youg people experience considerable personal growth, feel more empowered and more purposeful in regard of their vocational perspective than they felt before their departure. At the same time they felt more intercultural tolerant and more affirmative towards the European Project.

In last years a not correct management of emergencies often created critical situations. In the happening of a catastrophic event, it is human behaviour-- and often human behaviour alone--that determines the speed and efficacy of the crisis management efforts. Frequently speed and efficacy do not stem from the ignorance of procedures, but from the difficulty to operate in contexts where consistent damages are occurring, for the difficulty of managing emotional aspects. Training plays an important function to the preparation of the crisis manager. Currently two main modalities for training purpose are two: table top exercise and real world simulation exercise. Table top exercises are low cost and can be easily and frequently organized, but it cannot recreate the real atmosphere, (e.g. stress, confusion) and need to keep critical decisions in very little time. On the other hand, crisis managers trained through simulation exercises on the field can be very effective, but such a simulations are very expensive and cannot be easily and quickly organized. PANDORA will bridge the gap between table-top exercises and real world simulation exercises, providing a near-real training environment at affordable cost.

The most efficient commercial photovoltaic solar cells are based on silicon. While the reuse of feedstock is a severe concern of the photovoltaic industry, up to 50% of the valuable resource is lost into sawdust during wafering. Presently, the majority of silicon ingots are sliced in thin wafers by LAS (loose abrasive sawing) using slurry of abrasive silicon carbide particles. The silicon carbide is not separable from the silicon dust in an economical way. The newer FAS (fixed abrasive sawing) uses diamond particles fixed to the cutting wire. It is expected that FAS will replace LAS almost completely by 2020 for poly/mono-crystalline wafering. The intention of the proposed project is to recycle the FAS loss aiming at a sustainable solution. The main problem is the large surface to volume ratio of micron size silicon particles in the kerf loss, leading to formation of SiO2 having a detrimental effect on the crystallisation.

Overheating the silicon melt locally in combination with optimised electromagnetic stirring provides the means to remove SiO2.

Technological advances to reduce packaging costs are therefore of pivotal importance to maintain the competitive edge of assembly companies.

Due to the higher level of integration and signifcantly shorter cycle times this new technology will give European packaging companies a clear competitive advantage particularly over their US competitors. Quality of the bonds will be improved as well due to better selectivity and special designed materials as well as the precisely adaptable frequency of the microwave.

In 2015, the EU-28 employment rate of recent male graduates (78.6 %) was somewhat higher than the rate recorded among recent female graduates (75.3 %) (EUROSTAT, 2016). Recent male graduates in the EU were more likely to find work than their female counterparts.  Some of these gender differences may be explained by the nature of studies (fields) that are typically followed by the two sexes (for example, a higher proportion of science and technology students tend to be male) and by differences in labor market demand for graduates with different skills (EUROSTAT, 2015). Furthermore, in OECD economies, one in ten employed women is self-employed, almost half the rate of self-employed men (18%) (\u201cGender differences in self-employment rates\u201d, in Entrepreneurship at a Glance 2016, OECD Publishing, Paris).\r\nOBJECTIVE. \r\nHillary wants to develop an innovative entrepreneurial learning model to foster female entrepreneurship and gender friendly initiatives by female university students attending universities in humanities and arts, education and social science. \r\nTARGET GROUP. \r\nHillary wants to inspire and support female students close to graduation attending universities in humanities and arts, educational and social science who face serious difficulties in the transition from university to work to develop an entrepreneurial mind-set and attitude.

They are an opportunity both for the public sector and for the markets, so that the products and services better satisfy individual but also collective aspirations. But this inventiveness needs to be directed and guided towards market-relevant initiatives, to become social businesses, i.e. enterprises with a positive social impact.\r\nWho ca offer this guidance and facilitation service? \r\nThe European ESII, a professional in virtual incubation, that provides expert consulting and tailored workshops to help social entrepreneurs and innovators build the skills, strategies and networks they need to succeed. \r\nIn different contexts in Europe, there are some consultants dealing with social innovation incubation, although a common training path is missing and the profession of ESII is not recognized. This hinders the transparency of competences and creates barriers in the mobility of individuals within the European labour market. In addition, the lack of a recognised profession in this field, means a shortage of competent and qualified experts able to unleash the potential of emerging ideas and initiatives, allowing the creation of social changes and social businesses.\r\nOrganisations working as consultants, training providers, incubators for traditional business, should get prepared to also support social entrepreneurship and scale up social innovation initiatives, in light of the primary role that social business plays in the economy and in society.\r\nHence, in order to favour mutual recognition and transparency of competences, the project will develop:\r\n1. The ECVET competence profile of the European ESII\r\n2. The curriculum of a training course for ESII\r\n3. A procedure for the recognition of competences \r\n4. Guidelines for the accreditation of organizations carrying out training addressed to ESII\r\n5.

The curriculum will enable students to acquire expert knowledge and skills, as well as entrepreneurial and transversal skills highly valued by employers, thereby providing them with a competitive advantage on the labour market. The curriculum will be implemented using innovative didactic techniques, which will improve the teaching skills of the HE teachers.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS: The AQU@TEACH consortium comprises five partners from four countries (SI, CH, ES, UK). High international quality and a proven track record of successful cooperation between the partners will ensure the quality and sustainability of the project results. \r\n\r\nACTIVITIES: In line with the trend of integrating economics into study programmes, the students will attend a summer school combining aquaponics expertise with entrepreneurial skills.
