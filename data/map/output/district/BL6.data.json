The students can decide in which year of the training their internship takes place and most of them acquire their internships in the European regions covered by ERASMUS+ autononomously. Further partners of the project are local companies, our European twin schools in France, Spain and Poland as well as our twin towns Scarborough (UK) and Ostroda (Poland).  The aim of this project is to meet the  increasing demand of trainees with work experience abroad. Not only can the students learn the theoretical aspects of their training but also can they experience the real working life abroad. Furthermore both the language and the intercultural skills which require openness and empathy towards different living and working conditions abroad are of special importance.\r\n\r\nBy doing an internship in the EU our trainees will have a competitive advantage in German companies  and thus concerning their professional competency. As a lot of them are forced to leave our structually weak region after their traineeship this is of particular relevance. Just as all of our projects since the year 2000 this project is aiming both at sustainability and at encouraging the willingness to mobility. Since the 2008 flow local companies have tended to be interested in arranging their trainees\u2019 internship within their company structure and they have taken on less interns from other companies. This is why the twin towns Scarborough and Ostroda and the twin schools of the Leonardo da Vinci Mobility Project play an important part in putting the trainees in contact with companies abroad.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities take place in the Easter, summer and autumn holidays. First the applicants have to hand in a motivational letter and a Europass CV. After intense interviews we implement an intercultural training block course individually matched to the participants in order to prepare the mobility. Before the departure there is a meeting where the learning contract and the Europass mobility are set up. While being abroad the trainees are required to send short status reports to the project managers via email. The quality management is effected by means of reflection and evaluation sheets. Additionally the realised internships are assessed by a presentation at school in the vocational classes and a report published on our homepage. Non-satisfactory aspects of the internship are examined and improved in the next travel period.\r\n\r\nMoreover we enable our trainees to adapt their professional and social skills so as to attune them to Europe as a potential workplace. Concerning their academic performance the participants are predominantly good or very good students. We therefore expect them, above all, to act independently regarding the acquisition of the internship as well as the organization of accommodation, departure and arrival. The local companies support their trainees very well. What is more, there is a regular coordination with the project managers Ms V\u00f6lkel-Wipke and Ms Wertheim. This was the basis for the development of a network between our school, the local companies and the partner companies within the European Union. Last but not least there will be long-term synergy effects for the cooperation with our twin towns Scarborough and Ostroda and for the consolidation of the relationship with our European twin schools.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004818_10"]]}}, "6TL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Structured Training Course", "St. Monica's R.C.High School and Sixth Form Centre", 2652.0, 1, 1, "Having recently been appointed as Head of Modern Foreign Languages at St. Monica's R.C. High School, I was eager to expand the range of languages that were offered on the curriculum. Having been successful in previous applications for funding under the Comenius scheme, I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to acquire a third modern foreign language, Italian following an Italian Language, Culture and Methodology Course at Centro Fiorenza in Florence, Italy. \r\nHaving started as an absolute beginner, I have worked hard to maintain, develop and practice language that I learnt during my time at Centro Fiorenza and have funded several trips myself, to the same institution, in order to establish a strong sense of continuity in my learning. \r\nThe opportunity to return to Centro Fiorenza, motivates me enormously and in this way, I have been able to rapidly improve my language ability, due to the preparatory work that I complete throughout the year and the intensity of the programme and experience that I immerse myself in.\r\nI am now proud to say that I teach French, Spanish and Italian to GCSE level. In a school where modern foreign languages is a core subject, I am delighted that I am able to offer pupils the opportunity to study all three languages. With a significant community of pupils of Italian origin, the language has proved very popular. I am constantly seeking to expand my Italian vocabulary, communicate more fluently and have an understanding of increasingly complex grammar. It is for this reason that I aim to return to Centro Fiorenza, as I am confident that my learning is hugely accelerated in these conditions. \r\nThe experience alters my teaching. As well as studying various areas of teaching methodology, I find that my experience as the learner is absolutely invaluable. I frequently refer to my recent/current language learning experiences to demonstrate to my pupils that I am in tune with the frustrations, challenges and successes that they feel during their foreign language journey. I think that I am a positive role model and a live example to the pupils in my charge, that the desire to learn more, accomplish more and experience more, adds to the diversity of life and should be a life long objective.\r\nAs the only teacher of Italian in the school, my project proposal is for myself, but the impact of my training will expand beyond myself, to the pupils I teach, the members of my department, the staff at my school, the colleagues I network with from other\r\nschools in the Local Education Authority and the regional staff  with whom I am connected during the facilitation programmes that I  deliver.\r\nI would develop my teaching and learning skills even more by participating in a 2 week x 5 day course: \"Italian Language, Culture and Methodology Course\" in August 2014.
