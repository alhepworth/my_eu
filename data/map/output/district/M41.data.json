We wish to improve the way we teach , introducing more languages, improved methodology and resources, new innovative ideas and establishing school as a source of support for others within our area.\r\n\r\nWe are a large school with a large staff team. We work closely with our local authority language adviser and we are fully aware of the importance of developing a sustainable model of language provision that will be resistant to changes in staffing and of the importance of embedding language learning across our curriculum and within the life of our school. We are determined to work together as a whole school to achieve the best possible model of language provision and to become a beacon of good practice and a source of support for other schools. \r\n\r\nThrough this project we want to develop the teaching and learning of languages in our school and to offer our staff high quality opportunities for CPD. We want all our staff to be involved in the teaching of languages from early years to year six, allowing us to build a sustainable model of language provision.\r\n\r\nWe want to increase the number of languages taught in our school, introducing Spanish and increasing our provision of French, improve our teaching methods and increase creativity. We want languages and intercultural understanding to become embedded into every part of our school life and to continue to find innovative ways to extend our children\u2019s learning. We also want to introduce more ICT to support the teaching of languages. Another aim is to develop international links.\r\n\r\nWe want to improve attainment from our pupils and will particularly focus on our Pupil Premium children through offering them a range of language learning opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe plan to involve parents more in the life of our school and increase links with local cluster schools and secondary schools.\r\n\r\nWe plan to achieve these aims through a two-year project involving training courses in France and Spain. These courses will make a great contribution to our staff\u2019s ability to teach languages confidently throughout the primary years. We will involve our senior Management Team in this initiative. Language teaching will be built into every aspect of our school life. \r\n\r\nThe training will develop new teaching strategies and allow us to gather authentic resources to improve the way we teach languages in our school and allow us to be more creative in our curriculum. We will also establish links with schools in France and Spain and share our innovative approaches to learning with partner schools through joint projects. \r\n\r\nThe staff involved in the visits will then take part in dissemination and training of other staff to pass on the benefits. All staff will receive training during this project through our follow-up, dissemination and training activities.\r\n\r\nThe impact on our school would include:\r\nstaff better trained and more confident to teach or support the teaching of French or Spanish to any level within primary; \r\nimproved teaching and learning and \r\nan extension of provision leading  to better opportunities for our learners. \r\n\r\nChildren will have the opportunity to learn two languages or more and from this will further their understanding of how languages work, leading to better attainment in English. They will have more opportunities for enrichment activities as there will be an extension in provision of French and Spanish clubs, and languages will be embedded into other extracurricular activities. We will also have more celebration events in our school based on skills and knowledge acquired during this project. \r\n\r\nWe will have improved resources, and our teaching will be more creative and active. The children will also have the benefit of developing  further links with the schools in France and Spain. \r\n\r\nIncreased parental involvement will also impact on our children\u2019s learning, and the links we hope to develop with our secondary schools will lead to better transition arrangements and a better, more coherent language learning experience for our children in the long term. We particularly hope to have an impact on the learning and attainment of our Pupil Premium children. \r\n\r\nOur curriculum will be broad and balanced and we will embed languages and intercultural understanding in the daily life of our school. \r\n\r\nOur school will act as a hub for MFL for other schools in our area.

This has been invaluable in providing a cultural awareness and learning language skills from a native speaker. Each class, from Reception to Year 6, receives a 30/40 minute session a week. \r\n\r\nThis will be our second Erasmus + project.  From our first project we now have six members of staff who, with our FLA, have taken a much more active role in teaching Spanish, and supporting the rest of our staff with this. We need these staff to have a further boost to cement their skills and allow them to offer more support to colleagues, and build the skills of other colleagues to feel confident in their language abilities to deliver MFL, thus creating a more sustainable model for language learning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members of staff involved in our first project have shared their knowledge and resources with the rest of the staff in school and are confident to deliver in small sessions throughout the week and not just during our time with our FLA. These   gained so much knowledge and passion for the teaching of MFL in primary school that we are keen for this to continue. \r\n\r\nDuring our first courses , we made a link with a Spanish Primary School and both schools are enthusiastic  to embed our links further.\r\nFor our second project 6 further  members of staff will take part in immersion training in Spain. This is by far the most effective way to achieve our professional development aims. We have demonstrated thatiImmersion in the country, culture and language will lead to major increases in confidence and skills.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will build on the work started with our first Erasmus project. We greatly appreciate the input of FLAs to our languages teaching. However, we believe that to ensure we have a sustainable model of provision, we need to move away from reliance on them and plan strategically for languages to ensure that teaching is planned, monitored and assessed in the same way as other curriculum subjects. We have made great strides towards this goal from our previous project and a second project will help us to continue towards our goal. Our previous courses motivated our staff to seek out Spanish lessons outside of school and we want to support them in their MFL learning, enthuse and motivate those who did not get the chance to participate on the first project and cement the skills of repeating staff and the MFL coordinator so that they are better able to support others.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities will be just one part of the language learning involved in the project. All participants will take part in linguistic preparation and will be encouraged to continue their Spanish with self-study, evening classes etc. We intend to introduce formal recognition and validation of learning using Europass tools.\r\n\r\nReturning participants need to develop more confidence and update their knowledge of current language and culture to make their teaching more relevant and appealing to pupils.\r\n\r\nThree of the original participants will return for a follow-up course to further their skills and equip them to offer better support. New members of staff will take part in a beginner\u2019s course.\r\n\r\nBuilding on our first project there will be positive impacts on the structure of language teaching in our school, our direct participants, members of staff who do not attend the Spanish immersion courses, our MFL coordinator, available materials and training packages, our pupils, our link school. our parents and our local community. our 7 local secondary schools. and on other schools in the Trafford network\r\n\r\nAll participants will take an active role in dissemination and we have already begun to plan this process.

We want to give our staff the chance to rapidly improve their knowledge and understanding of languages, culture and teaching methodology in order to feel confident enough to begin to teach languages in their own class. We want to also focus on developing the skills of our MFL coordinator so that she is in a position to continue to support colleagues.The courses we would like to attend in Spain will allow staff to focus on improving their language, cultural knowledge and teaching skills and will also give them the chance to spend time in a Spanish primary school, observing good practice, developing links and establishing joint projects.We want to use this opportunity to develop really strong links with our Spanish link school that will lead to the establishment of regular communication and effective joint working on curriculum projects. This will greatly motivate pupils in both schools and give them an insight into each other\u2019s lives, leading to lasting friendships.

Six members of staff will take part in immersion training in Spain. We want Spanish to be embedded throughout the school day rather than simply during the children\u2019s weekly Spanish session. The resulting increase in skills and knowledge will mean that members of staff are able to gradually take over teaching of languages from the FLA. This will not only result in a more sustainable model of language provision in our school but will mean that our pupils get a better learning experience. The course will allow us to find fun and engaging ways to teach languages to all our pupils and to ensure that everybody is achieving their full potential.Working on joint cross curricular projects with the Spanish school will help us to embed Spanish across our school. Participants will be able to work together as a team to evaluate resources and to gather authentic resources that reflect current language and culture in Spain.The course also has a focus on improving transition from primary to secondary school with opportunities to share experiences and discuss issues.
