New membranes with improved chemical stability in a wide range of solvents, and better controlled cutoff properties and commercially viable membranes with high selectivity and flux for gas separations will be developed. The overall scientific and technical aim of the IMeTI project is to make important paradigm shifts in organic solvent nanofiltration and high temperature gas separation/purification, using cutting edge technologies based on membranes. The project involves the integration of the invention of new membranes and applications in the University/ Research Institute Partners with the subsequent development of the necessary membrane technology up to processing scale by the SMEs. A key feature of this project will be the interdisciplinary nature of the Partners, and the fact that they bring inter-sectorial competence to the network. We aim to create widely applicable, scalable, high performance process techniques and technologies.  The knowledge transfer and training programme involves Early Stage Researchers (ESR), at both university and industrial partners, each of whom gain high quality experience through combination of local and network wide research experience. Experienced Researchers (ER) will provide in depth knowledge, and will assist in mentoring the ESR. Visiting scientists will provide expertise from outside the network. In addition to their individual research, ESR and ER will increase their research capacity and knowledge through attendance of high level research conferences and workshops.

The catalysts will be constructed using components at the nano-scale in a bottom-up approach. Hereby, catalytically active metal complexes will be linked with nanoparticles such as polymeric microgels, hyperbranched polymers or hybrid systems consisting of silsesquioxanes attached to hyperbranched polymers. Further hierarchical organisation of HiCat catalysts will be accomplished by interconnected networks formed from the assemblies of catalytic nanoparticles using end-functional T-responsive polymers that can interact with functionalities on the surface of the nanoparticles as binding agents. Recycling of the catalyst-nanoparticle entities in multi-batch operation will be studied utilizing the change of solubility of the polymer supported catalysts by external stimuli. Based on polymer-nanoparticles linked by T-responsive polymers, new types of films and membranes with graded porosity can be prepared by varying the size of the nanoparticles and the length of T-sensitive polymers. This opens new opportunities for integration of catalytic steps and separation within the hierarchically structured system and, hence for continuous reactor operation. The proposal combines the superiority of homogeneous metal-organic catalysts often possessing nearly 100 % selectivity with the advantage of efficient separation by grabbing a new concept for building up hierarchically organised catalytic systems. Structural principles of tailor-made ligands will be transferred into tailor-made functional surfaces of nanoparticles. For proof of principle of the concept, three types of reactions will be studied: olefin metathesis, CX coupling and enantioselective hydrogenation.", 187589.0, 3359216.0, 6, 9, "HICAT", null, "http://duramem.evonik.com", "/docs/results/images/2010-12/55653.jpg", "fp7_88894_999730210"], [1220227200000, 1346371200000, "New Molecular Purification Technology for Pharmaceutical Production", "Evonik Membrane Extraction Technology Limited", "The NEMOPUR Initial Training Network will focus on creating a new generation of molecular purification technologies for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) manufacture, with a particular focus on removal of organic impurities from API production.
