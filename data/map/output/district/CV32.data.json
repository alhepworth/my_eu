A recent assessment of international school pairings in the Acad\u00e9mie shows 10 times less pairings in vocational schools than in other schools. Although these pairings do not necessarily lead to mobilities, it shows how difficult it is for vocational schools to work on European projects. Educators told us they find it hard to include Erasmus + projects in their practice.Many students still choose vocational studies because they dislike studies or they lack a professional project not because they are motivated. These studies therefore suffer from a poor reputation and are not attractive. Besides there is a high level of truancy, a high drop-out rate. Most students come from deprived families with little to no access to mobility and few students are motivated to go on to higher education. As teaching is challenging in these schools, teachers are used to working in teams on interdisciplinary projects to give the opportunity to students to succeed.These teams are innovative and highly motivated by Erasmus + projects but the level of technicality and availability necessary to prepare a candidacy, administrative aspects of the project makes it harder for them to start such projects.

As a result we have an increasing number of young people with a sense of exclusion, apathy and a disbelief in democratic principles.\r\n\r\nYoung people under 25 are underrepresented in the work force and as active citizens, decision-makers and problem solvers. Yet research shows that youth are in a unique situation to solve problems if they are given the opportunity. They are more likely to be risk-takers, innovative thinkers and to respond to peer teaching than adults.\r\n\r\nIn order to address unemployment and exclusion, young people need support in working with organisations and stakeholders to identify, design and implement projects that will encourage entrepreneurship, skill acquisition, community enhancement, peer networking and sustainability.  They need mentors and job search assistance and they need to know how to access this support. \r\n\r\nOur partner organisations plan to address these issues in this multi-leg Mobility project, which is in line with the EU Youth Strategy tackling the fields of social inclusion, education & training, employment & entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nWe will use a peer to peer approach to encourage the active participation of young people, particularly those from ethnic minority backgrounds, to become contributors to their local, regional, national and international communities on the issues of employability by setting examples of good practice, encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship, direct participation in policy drafting, sharing experiences, volunteerism, active mentorship and networking for a common result.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the Mobility project are:\r\n- facilitation of the inter- sectorial (NGOs, private businesses) networking process among participants and partner organisations\r\n- understanding the big picture of \u201cyouth employability\u201d and the potential of Erasmus+ programme and to motivate youth to become project multipliers and entrepreneurs\r\n- exchanging ideas and practices of youth participation and youth empowerment in a non formal way to support  grass-root initiatives, volunteering, networking of youth from ethnic minority backgrounds \r\n- exchanging local project experiences\r\n - exploring the skills and competences gained during the project\r\n- introducing participants to an array of new methods to create replicable presentations that will promote the values/concept of active citizenship through grass-root initiatives as an alternative to unemployment and social exclusion\r\n- create a base from which entrepreneurial projects can be developed, sustained and promoted and providing mentorship and resources\r\n\r\nParticipants: \r\n-  Youth Exchange (YE) 1 in Bulgaria: 28 young people (from the UK, Portugal, Latvia, Bulgaria) + 8 group leaders will present profiles, share experience and brainstorm on ideas on the project theme.\r\n - YE 2 in Latvia: 28 young people (ethnic minority background) + 8 group leaders, with some interest or experience in the topic and the desire to sustain and disseminate the topic.\r\n- YE 3 in Portugal: 36 young people motivated to act as Multipliers of the projects' achievements.\r\n\r\nThe working methods that will be used: research, interactive presentations, peer education techniques, simulation exercises, role play games and exercises on Inclusion techniques; workshops on Project management, best practice on employability and entrepreneurship opportunities, community involvement, skill acquisition, Erasmus+ Programme potential to motivate young activists to become project multipliers, inspiration visits and meetings with invited experts (employment and youth sector as well as representatives of private business structures), youth workers and researchers of different levels including European.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the Mobility project we will have a European group of motivated peer leaders and trained multipliers with necessary skills and competences to promote active citizenship, grass-root initiatives, entrepreneurship and facilitate employment skills and motivation of their peers.\r\n\r\nWe plan  to further spread our findings and knowledge to other youth organisations active with the issues of promoting social inclusion and supporting employment opportunities through entrepreneurial support of young people from ethnic minority backgrounds.

Immigrants and refugees are some of the most vulnerable members of society and many lack the digital skills and host- country language skills that are needed to fully participate in our modern society. This creates a gap that needs to be bridged in order for immigrants and refugees to \"plug in\" to the digital world and be fully participatory socially, economically and politically.  Developing digital competence is key for Life Long Learning and is becoming an ever more essential part of necessary employment skills as well as part of our everyday lives. Our partners have been working with refugee and immigrant youth in previous projects and have seen the need for increased digital competence among these young people in order for them to fully embrace all society has to offer including research and information management, increased employment skills, social networking, engagement with businesses and governments and the potential to develop a greater expanse of related competences. Digital competence is a transversal competence that enables the acquisition of other key competences (communication, civic responsibility, cultural awareness, creativity, entrepreneurship).  We wish to address these needs through a 2 leg Mobility Project that applies digital competence in a community volunteer setting as a means to deal with unemployment, lack of digital skills and social exclusion among refugee and immigrant youth.    The Project will be split into stages: preparation, implementation (2 legs Youth Exchanges), dissemination and follow up.The two legs of the implementation stage: Leg 1: The opening Youth Exchange in Lithuania will host participants including youth peer leaders interested in working with refugee & immigrant youth in their communities dealing with the issues of social and civic participation, youth employability, community volunteering and enhancement of digital skills. During the event the participants will prepare an Action Plan to be realised  at the next practice oriented activity of the Project. There will be 8 participants and a group leader from each of the participating partner countries. This event will be followed by the research in partner countries locally on the theme of the Project that will be looking at best practices of community volunteering and the best ways to approach the existing unemployment and social exclusion of young people using IT skills. Leg 2: The Youth Exchange in Portugal will be composed of youth from the first youth exchange as well as young refugee and immigrants who are highly motivated to participate in this project and to continue to \"pay it forward\" through peer to peer teaching and volunteer projects after the Youth exchange is over.  There will be 11 young people and 2 youth leaders from each participating partner country. During the second Youth Exchange, the ideas developed during the first youth exchange will be further developed and will generate a community volunteer project put together by the participants.  The main objectives of the Mobility project are:- facilitation of inter-sectorial networking processes among participants and partner organisations- promoting the concept and the values of community volunteering as a way to deal with unemployment and social exclusion- raising the awareness of the potential of Erasmus+ programmes to motivate youth to become project multipliers and entrepreneurs- increasing the digital competences of the participants- exchanging ideas and practices of youth participation/youth empowerment in a non formal way to support  grass-root initiatives, volunteering, civic participation and networking of youth from refugee and immigrant backgrounds - exchanging local project experiences- creating a base from which entrepreneurial projects can be developed, sustained and propagated- to develop a group of young motivated peer leaders and educators with the necessary skills and competences to promote the acquisition of digital skills and employment related skills and the ability and support to carry through with similar projects - to empower participants to share their knowledge and competences with their peersThe working methods that will be used: research, interactive presentations, peer education techniques, simulation exercises, workshops on inclusion/ digital skills/ project management, role play games, mentorship, a volunteer project designed and executed by the participants, information on the Erasmus+ Programme potential to motivate young activists to become project multipliers, inspirational visits to community centres, evaluation and feedback.

Youth from ethnic minority backgrounds are especially hard hit. Not only do they have higher rates of unemployment but they also often lack the skills they need to procure the jobs that are available and the resources to obtain those skills. As a result we have an increasing number of young people with a sense of exclusion, disbelief in democratic institutions, apathy and disenfranchisement. The segment of population under 25 is underrepresented in the work force and as active citizens, decision-makers and problem solvers. Yet the research shows that youth are in a unique situation to solve problems if they are given the opportunity. They are more likely to be risk-takers, innovative thinkers and to respond to peer teaching than adults.Young people, to combat unemployment, need support in working with organisations and stakeholders to identify, design and implement projects that will encourage entrepreneurship, skill acquisition, community enhancement, peer networking and sustainability.

The fact is that some regions of Belarus have been exposed to it due to the prevailing winds from that direction after it happened. We will be able to experience the life stories of people living there and get to know the Belarusian state and international programmes of support which are provided for the people (especially children) exposed to radiation.

They need to have a sense of belonging to the community and a sense of identity.  They also need the skills and competences that will help them begin to affect change in their communities.   Addressing these needs with effective and innovative solutions has become even more critical than before. \r\n\r\nSeveral factors need to be addressed to develop an effective program that will help young people from deprived areas.   Some of these include lack of education and skill due to early school drops-outs, inadequate training, lack of opportunity to develop experience, insufficient access to labour markets, lack of mentoring programs for entrepreneurs,  unawareness of opportunities, migrant status, and lack of inclusion. \r\n\r\nOur partner organizations plan to address these issues via the youth exchange process with the goal of facilitating a project where youth can come together in a multilateral, tolerant, inclusive environment and develop the skills they need to increase their employability as well as empowering them to develop the skills they need to fully participate in all levels of society (social inclusion).  This will be done with an eye towards developing entrepreneurial skills, community volunteering and innovative approaches to unemployment and other problems affecting youth from deprived urban areas.   \r\n\r\nThis exchange will bring together young people and youth leaders from the UK, Portugal, Moldova, and Belarus.  The participants for the exchange will be chosen by the participating partner countries and will be representatives of youth from deprived urban areas who face a higher than average chance of being unemployed, disenfranchised, poor, undereducated, or from migrant backgrounds.    Our youth leaders will meet the criteria of being peer leaders, youth activists, and having some experience in working with youth on a international level as well as involvement in community councils or forums.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project will be to bring together youth leaders and youth at risk to work on the issues that will help resolve and remediate the issues that affect youth from deprived urban areas focusing on innovative solutions, entrepreneurship and building key competences and skills.

The skills learned in this exchange are not only applicable to promoting gender equality/freedom from gender based violence but can be expanded to form a broader base for life learning experiences allowing for improvement in knowledge, skills, thought processes, engagement in active citizenship, volunteering, intercultural dialogue, intercultural tolerance, and increased communication skills.

What is more, a work experience in England has already been achieved in 2013, it concerned students in NVQ level 2 and WARWICKSHIRE COLLEGE, our partner in the U.K. was involved.

Their low weight, along with their inherent resistance to corrosion and fatigue, enables more fuel efficient and sustainable transport structures. However, for many applications, the biggest factor currently preventing the more widespread use of light high-performance polymer matrix composites is their poor fire performance. This is due to the organic matrices, which first soften on heating, causing a loss of mechanical properties and then, at higher temperatures, decompose. Decomposition results in the production of smoke and toxic or flammable decomposition products. These products are not only hazardous in terms of lack of visibility and toxicity; they can also burn, releasing heat, which can lead to flame spread and exacerbate the fire. Furthermore, loaded composite structures often collapse in a fire within a period of minutes, depending on the magnitude of the load and heat flux. The overall aim of the project is to develop novel, cost-effective, high-performance, lightweight polymer matrix composites with a step-change improvement in fire behaviour. FIRE-RESIST will achieve this by carefully targeted research in five key areas: 1. Micro-layered structural materials that are designed to delaminate extensively when exposed to heat, thereby generating a multiplicity of internal interfaces that provide a fire barrier of exceptionally low thermal conductivity. 2. Hybrid thermoset composites that are polymeric at normal temperature, but which decompose under fire to provide highly protective ceramic char phases. 3. High char polymer matrix composites derived from sustainable, naturally-sourced materials. 4.

The proposed project aims to extend the applicability of composite moulds into the more demanding regime of RTM production, as well as to extend the application of the open mould and light RTM techniques in the field of advanced resin systems, where elevated temperature is required. Most important Innovations are: i. embedded heating elements, based on the carbon reinforcement of the mould, close to the mould-part interface demanding less energy. ii. Incorporation of flow, temperature and cure sensors that will enable full automatic control of the process. iii. Layout of a cooling system consisting of a conformal (following the contour of the part) tubing network. iv. Use of piezoceramic film actuators which will induce micro-vibrations and thus assist resin flow inside the cavity. Such actuators on the edges, can be used for demoulding thus reducing tool complexity and demoulding time. Integration of these functionalities into a single \u201csmart\u201d mould is anticipated to impart a significant advancement of the composite and plastics manufacturing industry. It is obvious that by lowering the cost of the moulds the application of high end composites into the sectors of aerospace and automotive industry widens, serving weight reduction and the greening of the transport sector while extending the use of composites in other industrial sectors such as leisure and sport, the energy sector etc. Managing to develop composite moulds for the demanding RTM field, would automatically make them available for other manufacturing processes for engineering plastics and composites (RIM, Transfer moulding, Resin Infusion).

These goals are very challenging and are more demanding. Due to the increasing need for carrying heavier PL, the mass of the Rovers has increased considerably. The trend is an increase in the total rover\u2019s launch mass.\nTherefore, mass is a major issue for interplanetary missions as each additional kilogram influences the cost of the mission and it requires more fuel to be carried (the trajectory is very long).

The versatility of polymer composites means that they provide an ideal opportunity to develop novel multifunctional materials which can store the electrical energy required to power systems, whilst meeting the demands of the mechanical loading.

But due to organic nature of polymeric matrix component, composite materials are electrically and thermally bad conductors and they tend to burn easily, emitting toxic gases and smoke. For that, they require affordable, effective and certifiable protection systems against atmospheric hazards such as icing, as well as fire and burning in case of accidents.  Moreover, improved in field inspection techniques are required with the increased use of composite materials. Current technologies address those issues separately; ice protection is usually performed by mean of a metal mesh or foil incorporated into the outer ply of fabric on the skin of the structure, fire protection is performed with thermal barrier coatings on the structures and life monitoring is performed with embedded sensors.
