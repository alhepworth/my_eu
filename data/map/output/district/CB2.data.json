The 1st targeted therapy based on the DDR is inhibition of PARP by olaparib, which induces synthetic lethality in cancer cells with a specific DDR defect. Our members discovered olaparib, which is currently in Phase II trials. Its use in DDR deficient cancers represents a truly personalised healthcare approach. Due to the complexity of the DDR more therapeutically exploitable cases of synthetic lethality are to be discovered, which may be applied to specific tumours and patients. To this end our objectives include: To determine key differences in the DDR between cancer and normal cells, because they constitute important targets for directed individual therapy; establish the roles of DDR mechanisms as these relate to damage induced by anti-cancer therapies to explain inter-individual variation in therapy response; define how different DDR pathways compensate for one another, because this may suggest how targeting one DDR component with a drug could have marked cytotoxic effects on a cancer but not on normal cells; develop and validate markers for functionality of the DDR in fresh tumour biopsies, directly from the clinic, for selection of patients for personalised treatment.\nCollectively, this consortium has an unrivalled depth and breadth of expertise.

This is not possible without taking part in this project. Except providing the legal minimum, that means teaching at least three vocational subjects in English, our teachers are ready and willing to teach also other vocational and general subjects in English language.Aims of the project: The main aim of this project is to ensure the quality of bilingual education at school. Our school wants to become a prestigious school within the \u017dilina region and keep its proficiency by having qualified teachers with enough skills, competences, new ideas and experiences to ensure the  success of this field of study. Promotion, publicity and dissemination of the project achievements belong to the essential targets.Participants\u00b4profiles and their number: 11 teachers of both general and vocational subjects will take part in various courses enabling them to teach such subjects expertly. The selection of the courses has been done effectively and logigaly so as to set up the education in bilingual section with the greatest effort. The course \"Teaching business English\" is important mainly because of ensuring the way how to teach business English; the course \"Collegiality across Clil\" is necessary especially besause it is crucial to set up the cooperation among the English teachers and the teachers of theroretical and practical vocational subjects; the course \"CLIL is necessary because we have to cover the education of other general subjects in English language; the cources \"Teachers of English in vocational schools and Teachers in vocational schools\" are important for teaching English for vocational purposes and finally the course \"School development and quality evaluation \" give the principalship the ability to participate actively on the project. Methodology: particular activities of the project are planned in a logical order, chronologically, in accordance with the realisation of the courses; beginning with the selection of the participants upon pre-set criteria. Intercultural preparation will be ensured by the coordinator with the cooperation with an English lecturer. Organisational preparation will be managed by the coordinator with thecooperation with the partners. Monitoring of the project is its crucial part.Activities: Taking part in mobilities would give the teachers a great opportunity to use new  technologies for teaching English, make use of the software program Moodle, blended learning, create presentations, adopt business phrases, plan their lessons effectively, analyse and classify individual tasks, bring new study materials, exchange their experiences with other teachers. The project will help to set up the cooperation between the teachers of vocational subjects and general subjects in the bilingual section. The teachers as well as the principalship will have the opportunity to participate and observe relevant teaching lessons. The comparison between the Slovak and English educational systems could be  a great challenge for all the teachers to bring new methods, imagination and creativity into the teaching process. For the the teachers of English language it is a way how to become effective English teachers with using new methods, techniques, presentations, new words and phrases and how to motivate students by using various interesting activities. For the teachers of  vocational subjects it is a way how  to learn to teach English for the vocational purposes. For the principalship this project could be an opportuninty to exchange experiences and develop relations with directors from other European countries, practice their communication skills, get a different view how to solve various problematic situations at school.

We need to support the motivation (both of teachers and students) to study English, to initiate new creative teaching methods, to learn more about CLIL and British culture.  Moreover, we intend to focus on our students with special needs because they seem to struggle with the foreign language the most. \r\n We chose 7 out of 20 teachers involved in teaching English using the following criteria: high motivation, choice of the course suitable for the diversity of the project, personal and professional competency.  The selected participants have to show their enthusiasm to learn and share with others and they have to prove their determination to cooperate. The special teacher is included to the team to help with teaching students with special educational needs.\r\nTo promote creativity in our classrooms we selected a participant who will learn how to use drama, music, storytelling and role-play in teaching.\r\nTo refresh the methodology we chose two participants (one for young and one for secondary learners) who will improve their confidence and competence in English and update their skills in the class management and practical teaching techniques. \r\nTo teach cross-cultural awareness in the classroom we've got a participant who will explore different aspects of modern British life and culture.\r\nOne of our participants  is to develop her language skills and one is to learn more about the CLIL methodology.

The course content is CLIL methodological workshop led by experienced teachers with focus on science subjects, discussions of different approaches to CLIL in primary children education, many practical demonstrations, activities, advices and tips. This course will be held in Portsmouth 7.10.  - 15.10. 2017.\r\nFor another two lower primary teachers we plan a course named \u201cLanguage & Practical Methodology: Creativity in the Classroom\u201c, focused  on developing practical skills and gaining many new ideas for working with pupils aged 3-11 years, improving language competences, with the view to primary education in the UK, the opportunity to share their experiences, establish contacts with teachers for this age group in other European countries, obtaining knowledge of the culture and life in the UK, a picture of the everyday lives of children at home and at school.\r\nThe next course \u201cBringing British Culture to Life\u201c, is planned for one lower primary teacher together with one upper primary teacher. This course aims to improve knowledge of the language and culture in Britain, which are reflected in teaching intercultural awareness. The course will enable teachers to explore different aspects of modern life and culture in Britain; it will help to explore different ways to teach intercultural awareness as it also includes visits with commentary in major places in Cambridge.\r\nThe last course an upper primary teacher from our school would like to take part is in German language, as it is planned for a German teacher. The course \u201cMethods & Language\u201d takes place in Regensburg and informs about the current teaching trends, develops the skills for communication-oriented teaching. It also updates and enhances knowledge of the country, and gives the opportunity to establish contacts with teachers for this age group in other European countries.\r\nIn preparing the logistics ensuring of the educational stay, we will cooperate with the partner organization International Study Programmes. The participation of teachers would increase the practical skills, language self-esteem, valuable insight into trends and enthusiasm to apply them in everyday school practice.

Based on the previous needs, we have outlined the European Development Plan which includes six European mobility projects within four professional development courses.\r\nWith regard to enhancing international cooperation, we have chosen two courses \"How to make your school more international ? \" proposed by Euneos ,  How to become a teacher trainer \" , by Cambridge Bell.\r\nSpecifically, \"How to make your school more international \" Euneos clearly meets the need for development and integration of the international dimension in the curriculum, by creating both tangible results ( drafts of international development plan, concluding (bi)multilateral partnerships) as well as development of key competences of a good international coordinator, able to develop a  school vision and long-term policy plan on internationalisation. \r\nThe course \"How to become a teacher trainer\" organized by Bell Cambridge, with a world-wide reputation in the academic excellence, addresses our school\u2019s need of a highly-qualified English teacher trainer able to design, implement and run 20 bimonthly workshops throughout the year to facilitate linguistic preparation for our colleagues keen to develop and involve in international partnership projects.\r\nGiven that technology plays a vital role in today's society and students are incredibly receptive to digital technology, it becomes imperative to adapt ourselves to and adopt the new technologies in education. Therefore, the course \" How to use tablets in education\" meets our school\u2019s needs to specialize two teachers from different subject areas in digital education, to acquire the didactic and digital competences needed to successfully implement by 2016 pilot projects of tablet use  in students\u2019 learning program to facilitate the transition to digital education. Moreover, we need to learn from and be inspired by the efficiency of Finnish educational system by sending two teachers (at least one person from the Board members) to attend  Best Practices Benchmarking in order to improve both our school management and to set up a qualified team of promoters of innovation in the school responsible with improving the quality of teaching and learning through the development of innovative digital learning methods and tools ( blended learning, flipped classroom ) .\r\nIn conclusion, the six European mobilities for teacher training proposed within our school project are appropriate to achieve the two strategic objectives for institutional development. Moreover, once these strategic priorities are achieved, they trigger a major impact both on organizational level, as well as on individual beneficiaries and local community level.\r\n At macro - institutional level, the short and medium-term impact is visible in the following concrete outcomes :\r\n\u2022 workshop at school level based on planning, implementing and evaluating European partnership projects\r\n\u2022 at least one multilateral strategic partnership project grant \r\n\u2022 training course materials for the workshop English for International Cooperation Project\r\n\u2022 bimonthly workshops throughout one year to develop English language competences of staff willing to participate in future international projects\r\n\u2022 a guide for parents and teachers on How to use tablets in classroom (advantages / impact of using tablet applications in learning)\r\n\u2022 trainings for school staff on the use of tablets in teaching and learning\r\n\u2022 teacher\u2019s portfolio of digital resources with lesson plans integrating technology (plus a DVD with interactive lessons )\r\nThe long-term  impact is quantified by defining and successfully implementing :\r\n\u2022 a policy, strategy and vision of the school to promote international dimension and innovative methods in curriculum\r\n\u2022 pilot-projects based on the use of tablets in classroom to facilitate the transition to digital learning\r\n\u2022 a more international and innovative oriented curriculum ( how students learn Finnish ) by integrating  iPad applications in lessons", "http://www.bellenglish.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-RO01-KA101-001218_2"], [2017, "In\u0161pirujme seba kv\u00f4li ostatn\u00fdm - zmeny zhora znamenaj\u00fa systematick\u00e9 zlep\u0161enia", "Bell Educational Services Ltd", 8761.0, 5, 7, "Project \"LET'S GET INSPIRED TO INSPIRE - CHANGES FROM ABOVE MEAN SYSTEMATIC IMPROVEMENTS\" is a project of English Bilingual Gymn\u00e1zium of St. Edita Stein based on the idea that those who are responsible for management and leadership (regardless lead group of students or teachers) have to grow and get inspired in order to inspire others.

The principal objective of Fortissimo is to enable European manufacturing, particularly small to medium enterprises (SMEs), to benefit from the efficiency and competitive advantage inherent in the use of simulation.

Generally, large companies, which have a greater pool of skills and resources, find access to advanced simulation easier than SMEs which can neither afford expensive High Performance Computing equipment nor the licensing cost for the relevant tools. This means that SMEs are not able to take advantage of advanced simulation, even though it can clearly make them more competitive. The goal of Fortissimo is to overcome this impasse through the provision of simulation services running on a cloud infrastructure making use of High Performance Computing systems also making appropriate skills and tools available in a distributed, internet-based environment.<br/>Fortissimo will make advanced simulation more easily accessible, particularly to SMEs, through the realisation of a 'one-stop shop' where hardware, expertise, applications, visualisation and tools will be easily available and affordable on a pay-per-use basis. In doing this it will create and demonstrate a sustainable commercial ecosystem where actors at all levels in the value chain can realise sufficient commercial benefit to enable that ecosystem to persist independently of EU funding and continue to provide affordable services to manufacturing industry, particularly SMEs.<br/>Fortissimo will be driven by end-user requirements where (~50) business-relevant application experiments will be used to develop, test and demonstrate both the infrastructure and the 'one-stop pay-per-use shop'.

Due to their exceptionally long spin lifetimes, these carbon-based materials could also have an important impact on spintronics, where carrier spins, rather than charges, play a key role in transmitting, processing and storing information. However, to exploit this potential, a method for direct conversion of spin information into an electric signal is indispensable. Spin-charge conversion in inorganic semiconductors and metals has mainly relied on the spin-orbit interaction, a fundamental relativistic effect which couples the motion of electrons to their spins. The spin-orbit interaction causes a flow of spins, a spin current, to induce an electric field perpendicular to both the spin polarization and the flow direction of the spin current. This is called the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). We have very recently been able to observe for the first time the inverse spin-Hall effect in an organic conductor. This breakthrough raises important questions for our understanding of spin-charge conversion in materials with intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling. It also expands dramatically the range of materials and structures available to address some currently not well understood scientific questions in spintronics and opens opportunities for realising novel spintronic devices for spin-based information processing and spin caloritronic energy harvesting that make use of unique properties of hybrid, organic-inorganic structures.

The research aims to extend the range of glassy states and to explore the consequences of unusual states, particularly for mechanical properties and for phase stability/crystallization. One possible limit to rejuvenation is the onset of fast crystallization.

The central idea is to organise the parameters of Universal Grammar into hierarchies, which define the ways in which properties of individually variant categories may act in concert; this creates macroparametric effects from the combined action of many microparameters. The highest position in a hierarchy defines a macroparameter, a major typological property, lower positions define successively more local properties. Parameter-setting in language acquisition starts at the highest position as this is the simplest choice; acquirers will 'move down the hierarchy' when confronted with primary linguistic data incompatible with a high setting. Hence the hierarchies simultaneously define learning paths and typological properties. The main task of the project, and  most of the time of the research team working on it, will be devoted to attempting to work out on the basis of cross-linguistic data the precise form of major parts of the hierarchies, thus subjecting the theoretical predictions to rigorous empirical testing. This will be done on the basis of secondary data from grammars, from on-line databases (The World Atlas of Languages Structures, WALS, and the Syntactic Structures of the World\u2019s Languages, SSWL), and, where feasible, from native-speaker consultants. The form of the hierarchies makes predictions concerning acquisition, markedness and language change.

More empirical studies are needed because few radiations have been examined from many different perspectives (including in insects).

Each human cell receives tens-of-thousands of DNA lesions per day. These lesions can block genome replication and transcription, and if not repaired or repaired incorrectly, they lead to mutations or wider genome aberrations that threaten cell viability. To counter such threats, life has evolved the DNA-damage response (DDR), to detect DNA damage, signal its presence and mediate its repair. DDR events impact on many cellular processes and, crucially, prevent diverse human diseases that include cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, immune-deficiencies and premature ageing. While much progress has been made in identifying DDR proteins, much remains to be learned about the molecular and cellular functions that they control. Furthermore, the frequent reporting of new DDR proteins in the literature suggests that many others await identification. The main goals for the proposed research are to: identify important new DDR-proteins and DDR-modulators, particularly those responding to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs); provide mechanistic insights into how these proteins function; and determine how DDR events are affected by chromatin structure, by molecular chaperones and components of the Ubiquitin and Sumo systems. To achieve these ends, we will use molecular biology, biochemical, cell-biology and molecular genetics approaches, including synthetic-lethal and phenotypic-suppression screening methods in human cells and in the nematode worm.

An excellent example is shoot branching, where the body plan of the shoot system conferred by one genotype can range from a single unbranched stem, to a highly ramified bush, depending on the growth conditions. In recent years we have investigated the hormonal network that allows environmentally sensitive changes in shoot branching in Arabidopsis. Through the analysis of a set of monogenic mutants with clear effects on both the number of shoot branches produced and on its responsiveness to environmental inputs, we have developed a model for shoot branching control involving interactions between three systemically transported plant hormones. In collaboration with Prusinkiewicz (Calgary), we have built a computational implementation of this model, which captures the phenotypes of wild-type plants and, through the manipulation of single biologically plausible model parameters, our mutant phenotypes. While there is still much to learn about individual network components, the mechanistic framework we have established is sufficiently well developed to allow network-level investigation. We therefore propose an ambitious project to use natural allelic variation in shoot branching and its environmental sensitivity as in vivo differently parameterized versions of the shoot branching regulatory network, which can be compared with parameter space exploration in our computational model. By investigating the properties of shoot branching in diverse genotypes and in the computational model parameter space, we will identify trait correlations that will contribute to understanding the architecture of the regulatory network.

These axons survive throughout the lifetime of an organism, often many years in mammals, yet how axons are maintained is not fully understood. Recently, we provided in vivo evidence that local mRNA translation in mature axons is required for their maintenance. This new finding, along with in vitro work from other groups, indicates that promoting axonal protein synthesis is a key mechanism by which trophic factors act to prevent axon degeneration. Here we propose a program of research to investigate the importance of ribosomal proteins (RPs) in axon maintenance and degeneration. The rationale for this is fourfold. First, recent genome-wide studies of axonal transcriptomes have revealed that protein synthesis (including RP mRNAs) is the highest functional category in several neuronal types. Second, some RPs have evolved extra-ribosomal functions that include signalling, such as 67LR which acts both as a cell surface receptor for laminin and as a RP. Third, mutations in different RPs in vertebrates cause unexpectedly specific defects, such as the loss of optic axons. Fourth, preliminary results show that RP mRNAs are translated in optic axons in response to trophic factors. Collectively these findings lead us to propose that locally synthesized RPs play a role in axon maintenance through either ribosomal or extra-ribosomal function. To pursue this proposal, we will perform unbiased screens and functional assays using an array of experimental approaches and animal models. By gaining an understanding of how local RP synthesis contributes to axon survival, our studies have the potential to provide novel insights into how components conventionally associated with a housekeeping role (translation) are linked to axon degeneration.

Moreover, research shows that interventions at primary schools supporting children who are at risk have stronger effects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this context, this project aims to support primary schools in socially disadvantaged areas to use an evidence-based and theory-driven approach to promote students\u2019 basic skills in mathematics. Schools in four countries are supported to develop their own strategies and actions by using a dynamic approach to school improvement, taking into account their context and the specific problems/challenges they face. The proposed approach draws on a dynamic theory on educational effectiveness which has been systematically tested through national and international studies. This theory draws attention to the actions taken at the school and classroom level in order to improve the school learning environment and the quality of teaching. It also refers to quantitative and qualitative characteristics of these factors by giving special attention to the differentiation dimension. Differentiation is not only seen as an aspect of effective teaching, but also as a dimension that should be taken into account in defining school policy for teaching and school policy for improving the school learning environment. Thus, this project draws on experiences of previous studies which show that these factors are associated with student learning and their learning outcomes and aims to promote quality and equity at school level. Schools in socially disadvantaged areas are, therefore, encouraged to identify intermediate objectives concerned with the improvement of school learning environment and school policy for teaching that can contribute to the improvement of learning outcomes in mathematics. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically, academic institutions in four countries with an expertise in research on school effectiveness and school improvement will collaborate with about 70 primary schools in socially disadvantaged areas to use the dynamic approach to promote student learning and learning outcomes in mathematics. Schools are supported to establish school evaluation mechanisms to measure school factors and students basic skills in numeracy and identify their improvement priorities. Schools also receive training on the dynamic theory and its use for promoting quality and equity in education. Support to design their improvement strategies and action plans will be provided. In addition, attention will be given to the development of internal mechanisms to monitor the implementation of the intervention in order to continuously adapt their action plans. Finally, a value-added approach will be used to evaluate the impact of the dynamic approach on: a) improving the school learning environment, b) improving school policy for teaching, c) developing students\u2019 basic skills in mathematics, and d) reducing unjustifiable differences in student achievement. Beyond measuring the impact of each strategy, we also investigate the conditions under which the use of an evidence-based and theory-driven approach to promote quality and equity will be effective, in relation to the achievement of basic skills in mathematics in socially disadvantaged areas. Finally, the project will draw implications for improving regional and national policy on promoting equity in education and search for possibilities to expand this approach in other areas in education and other countries.", "http://www.cam.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-CY01-KA200-000281_6"], [2016, "Multilingual early childhood education and care for young refugee children", "THE CHANCELLOR MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE", 134106.0, 4, 4, "Many children in Europe grow up with a home language other than the official or majority language of the country they live in. Especially now that in the past few months a lot of refugee families have come to Europe, there is an urgent need to provide a first shelter to these families, not only in terms of housing and food, but also in terms of safety, care and education. There is a strong need for a humanitarian and sustainable approach of the refugee issue, not only because of the high numbers of refigees, but also because we know this will not be a temporary challenge. Refugee children between 0 and 5 are particularly vulnerable, and high quality ECEC is essential to alleviate childhood trauma and levels of toxic stress.We believe in the power of language and communication: respect for and attention to the first language of young children is key to emotional safety, while the second language provides opportunities for an optimal development in the receiving country. Therefore, the use of multiple languages, hence multilingualism, plays a central role in the first reception of young refugee children.We also believe in the added value of high quality ECEC with respect to processing traumatic experiences, because it provides children with a safe, relaxing, playful, pedagogically sound environment where they can meet and play with peers.ObjectivesThe overall objective of the proposed project is to enhance the quality of Early Childhood Education and Care for young refugee children (age 0-4) by providing tools to educators, child care professionals and policy makers. Ultimately, not only the participating countries, but other countries as well, benefit from a well organised system of ECEC and language learning, since that will ensure refugee children to be better prepared for their future in the receiving country.The project purpose is:\u2022 to collect examples from four different countries of how Early Childhood Education and Care for young refugee children is organised, both with respect to the legislation as well as to the practices (conditions, involvement of the children, perceived effectiveness)\u2022 to analyse and categorize these examples\u2022 to implement the activities in different settings\u2022 to evaluate these activities\u2022 to develop a toolbox for ECEC professionals working specifically with young refugee childrenThere is a need in many European countries for both legislation as well as concrete implementation tools for ECEC practices (conditions, involvement of the children, perceived effectiveness) directed towards young refugee children. For example, in the Netherlands, Sardes investigated the need in 42 municipalities. Whereas 16 of these provided some form of professional ECEC, almost all municipalities stated in the interviews that they felt a clear need for legal guidelines as well as guidelines about what types of pedagogical and didactic approaches are the most effective when working with young refugee children. At this moment, there is no budget, no national legislation, and in general there seems to be a lack of attention for this particular group. Of the 2.500 children in refugee centres in the Netherlands, 33% is currently receiving some form of ECEC, depending on the local policy of the municipality. In most cases, however, young refugee children have no access at all to high-quality ECEC services, they start their school career without the skills they need to succeed.", "http://www.cam.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NL01-KA201-023024_1"], [2016, "Relaci\u00f3n entre la calidad tonal percibida del viol\u00edn y las caracter\u00edsticas intr\u00ednsecas, geom\u00e9tricas y ac\u00fasticas de los materiales de la caja arm\u00f3nica.", "THE CHANCELLOR, MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE", 48115.0, 3, 3, "BACKGROUNDWhat is taught in different violin making schools and has reached to our times comes from a few treaties, documents, measurements made in the nineteenth century in the best instruments and some molds made by those who were the biggest Cremonese violin makers of the XVI-XVIII centuries. Thanks to the new technology and the efforts of luthiers interested in science and scientists fully involved in violin making, today many of the \"secrets\" of these instruments has emerged, with respect to its tonal quality. Still, there are some mysteries to be discovered in order to build with considerable control high quality instruments. One of the least investigated  topics is the direct correlation between the properties of materials, the perceived tonal quality and performance characteristics. While the sound radiation is the result of vibration of the structure this can be used directly (?) The perfect coupling properties of the top and bottom woods has not yet been investigated although this is one of the crucial questions that violin makers ask themeselves. The excellent sound of some instruments depends on the first three or four vibration modes of the complete box, in wich the bottom, with top and garlands, fully conditions the formation of these modes.Jesus Alonso Moral made a first investigation in 1984, in Sweden, as part of his PhD, combining three different tops with three different ribs and three different backs -soft, normal and stiff- to try to understand the interaction between them related to the tonal quality of the instrument. Today precision in measurements is greater. The theories about the behavior of the violin are more accurate and a we have a more rigorous perceptual evaluation protocol based on the psychology of perception. Andrea Ortona conducted a similar experiment along with 20 students in Cremona but it was no possible to control correctly the parameters.OBJECTIVESThe key objective is double: on the one hand the control of the violin maker on the construction parameters, so that the demands of performers and listeners on the tonal quality of the instruments are satisfied, and on the other hand the implementation in the Study Plan (Curriculum) of a methodology to widen the capabilities of the students and also increase the prestige of the school, increasing in this way the employability of the students attending the studies.PARTICIPANTSThe members have been selected by their experience in each of the different phases of the project: Roberto Jard\u00f3n Rico for his experience in handling CNC, George Stoppani for his experience in the creation of the revolutionary modal analysis method and subsequent interpretation. Andrea Ortona for his experience in managing a similar educational project in Cremona school, and finally Claudia Fritz for her experience in the assessment of the perceptual quality.DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIESFive Violins will be built, using woods with carefully selected properties. First, three violins with identical tops and different backs and later two violins with different tops on three identical backs will be made. Both tops and backs will be built by CNC to a pre-selected form to accurately control this variable. Then they will be tuned and measured in different stages: thicknesses, frequencies and masses, in the Violin Making school of Bilbao by the students, with supervision and collaboration of the project members. Finally a double-blind perceptual quality test will be performed with the collaboration of professional musicians and specialized audience. Once this phase is finished the intellectual products and their dissemination will be created.PLANNED IMPACTIf the results are conclusive and they respond to the working hypothesis, the impact on the violin maker community will be very important regarding to the control and quality level of the products that will be obtained.Also, the skills acquired by the students and by future generations will increase their employability and the quality of their products. Moreover, the Study Plan (Curriculum) will be adapted to the new teaching methods.LONG TERM BENEFITS-Increase of the skills in the (Curriculum) Study Plan.-Better training of the students.-More prestige for the school with a consequent increase  of the students employability.-More Control of materials and processes, and better quality products made by violin makers.-Satisfaction of the music sector.", "http://www.cam.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA202-025638_1"], [2018, "Kompetensh\u00f6jning f\u00f6r musikl\u00e4rare", "THE CHANCELLOR MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE", 24703.0, 2, 2, "The KA-1 project \"Competence Development for Music Teachers\" has been initiated based on the needs for improving the quality of music education in the music classes at Hagaskolan in Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of music classes in Sweden goes back to 1939. As the second municipality in Sweden, Norrk\u00f6ping started their music classes in 1960. Teaching is performed in large classes focusing on choir singing as the main in music teachers tool for musical knowledge development. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, there have been many changes among the staff teaching music at Hagaskolan, and the knowledge and experience of classroom teaching varies greatly between music teachers. Meanwhile the number of pupils has and the groups are  more heterogeneous today than ever before. All in all, this means that the quality of classroom teaching and the level of concerts and performances does not meet the same high standards as in previous decades.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to increase the participants' professional skills through the planned activities, which is expected to affect the quality of classroom of music teaching. The objectives of the projects are:\r\n\r\n- Teachers have learned new methods of teaching choir singing\r\n- students' results in music theory have improved\r\n- the singing ability in all classes have improved, regardless of profile\r\n- Improvement of the school organization in terms of benefiting more of the music profile\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the goals, 5 music teachers and 1 principal will job shadow teachers and principals The Choir of St John's, Cambridge and at Saint John's College School, which is expected to give the teachers role models in driver's internship with advanced-level driving and The principal is expected to gain knowledge and experience that can contribute to the development of Hagaskolan's organization. The same music teachers will also attend courses focusing on methodology, choir singing, vocal development of young voices as well as the Kodaly methodology. The courses are given in the UK, Denmark and England. Through continuous dialogue and evaluation, collegial learning is expected to grow among all participating teachers. The 16 mobilities will take place over a period of 2  years and will be monitored, evaluated and disseminatied on a continuous basis.\r\n\r\nThe project will include the following measuring tools:\r\n- Theoretical musical test based on the local goals for Norrk\u00f6ping's music classes before implementing new methods.

The Mathilde-Weber Vocational College in T\u00fcbingen promotes the said project and has been engaged in annually implementing occupational mobility since 2003. The aim is to improve the quality of early childhood education and care through gaining insight into settings in other countries.  The promotion of social  skills and competence is a key subject in educational work with children. The project theme is put into practice  through observation within the allocated setting, conversation and discussion with the trained staff there and  activities specifically designed to promote social skills in those taking part. Participants are involved in all aspects of  procedure within the partner setting and take on responsibility for their own  personal activities and for tasks within the group.\r\n\r\nThe project is planned to comprise 46 participants who in September/October 2015 or September/October 2016 will travel abroad as members of two separate groups.

Immersion in a foreign cultural environment  strengthens the receptiveness for new things and tolerance of anything different. Personal experience of being foreign makes the participant more sensitive to children and families with a history of migration and qualifies him or her for educational work within a diversely ethnic society. \r\nImproved language skills and an understanding of educational settings in other European countries encourage European thought and strengthen solidarity within Europe. \r\n \r\nThe comparison of individual experiences gained within diverse settings in different countries leads to a recognition of  and reflection on differences and similarities; personal attitude is  examined and the approach to the profession strengthened. \r\nParticipants are prepared for their work placement abroad over a one-year period.
