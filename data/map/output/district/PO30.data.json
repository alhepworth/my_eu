Life for young people today is highly stressful with pressure to look a certain way and to be ever present online. This is having an impact on their health due to inactivity, unhealthy diet and substance abuse in order to fit in and also to help them either lose weight or look fitter quickly. This in turn can lead to a lack of motivation to learn and early school leaving. The 6 partners from Norway, Poland, Lithuania, Greece, Germany and the UK all have a common interest in healthy diet and sport. Sport participation has been proven to increase activity, improve mood and combat obesity and diabetes, but it is often difficult to convince young people of the benefits as it involves more effort on their part. Our objevtives therefore are to create an eBook designed by young people, which will help teachers to motivate their students to improve their lifestyle through relaxation, diet and active sport. We also aim to create and train student ambassadors who can become actively involved in motivating their peers to change their lifestyle. In doing so they will also improve their own motivation to study and their opportunities to succeed in their chosen career, which in turn will benefit educational establishments and employers as they will have access to a healthier workforce.The training will be delivered via 5 student/teacher learning/training activities involving 2 teachers and 2 students. Initially students will survey their peers about their lifestyles and then present their findings in a powerpoint. This will establish what they need to learn and encourage them to find solutions through the training they receive in diet, relaxation techiniques, anti-doping and sports activities. At each training event they will learn new sports and training methods and about the diet of the partner country they are visiting and how healthy this is. They will use this information to create healthy but appealing recipes and training sessions. In addition in Greece they will learn about the Olympic movement and fairplay in sport and develop an ethical code, in Germany they will learn about relaxation techniques, and in Norway they will learn about anti-doping and disability in sport. In Lithuania they will learn how to create a balanced diet and participate in a cookfest. From these training activites they will then propose recommendations on how to combat the issues affecting  young people's lifestyles as identified in their initial survey and develop an eBook and film resources. They will then be trained as ambassadors to spread the message and encourage their peers to be come involved in sport, eat more healthily and turn their lives around. In this way they will achieve more and get better jobs.The project partners will also create a five-language digital application \u2013 audiovisual guide for smartphones about the ancient Stadium and the Palaestra which will be donated to the Greek Ministry of Culture in order to be uploaded onto the site of ancient Messene; a project website, an eTwinning platform and a Facebook page. At each stage of the project they will test the content of the eBook, including at a a teacher conference in Poland and a schools dissemination event in the UK.We envisage that a wide range of stakeholders, including 300 students and teachers of which 20% are participants with fewer opportunities, will benefit from the results of our project as young people become more healthy and motivated to learn. This, along with the opportunity for them to work alongside their European peers will help them better understand the common and different issues each partner country faces and so make them more aware European citizens.

This strategy goal will be achieved with own resources of the College and supported by Erasmus+ Mobility project, international project of European Comission as well as by education export project financed by ESR.\r\nErasmus+ mobility periods are regarded as a practical tool for internationalizing the college, working against racism and improving the language skills and life coping skills. These are especially important in our small town, Savonlinna, where there are not many possibilities to meet foreigners and practice language skills in natural situations in winter. In summers the town is an international tourist attraction. Hopefully some of the students stay in this region to improve the international knowledge of the companies. However, most of the students end up in bigger cities, where the international relations are part of everyday life and international know-how is a requirement for employment.\r\nIn SAMIedu we constantly work for equality. In addition to the principle to divide the mobility grants among all fields of vocational education evenly we want to offer exchange periods to students, who haven\u2019t had any previous possibility to travel. Students who get income support are also supported with a 350\u20ac grant of our college. Also students studying in preparatory education are sent with their teacher to a familiarization period abroad. In this project we intend to send more male students by laing more emphasis on marketing and using efficiently the new network partnerships, which have been gained through our previous logistics, forestry, metal and vehicle technology projects. Several foreign student groups of these fields will work in the workshops of SAMIedu college in the school year 2018-2019. We\u2019ll also send students studying competence-based vocational qualifications to exchange periods, e.g. datanomes, masseurs and restaurant cooks. These students are mainy adults with families, that\u2019s why we offer them also short exchange periods of 32 days.\r\n\r\nFurther we are starting co-operation with the apprentices of Savonlinna Works Company. They can get acquainted with the tasks of an assembler in the factories of the partnership network in Europe for 2 months. This co-operation has been planned on the need of the company.\r\nIn this project a large variety of digital equipment is used. Students will report their experiences in the blog www.moprosamiedu.blogsport.fi and they will be mentored in WhatsApp by teachers. In this project we\u2019ll further put effort into developing the coaching and the students will collect video material for marketing of exchange periods and our college. From this material we\u2019ll make augmented reality using Thinglink and 360' cameras.

The partners for Euroskill Network 2- project have been chosen according to the needs of economic life in order to enable the growth of international skills of each participant. During the first KA1- project of our institution (Euroskill Network between 2016-2018), vehicle technology and logistics departments have started a very successful co-working relationship with the Spanish VET- school IES Virgen de la Paz, Madrid. New themes of Euroskill Network 2- project are related to pedagogical development and increasing the opportunities of vehicle technology and logistics students to join VET-training in Spain and in Finland. Also vehicle businesses from Forssa, Finland are joining the mobility activities of this project. Hotel-, restaurant and catering department is aiming to increase the opportunities to participate VET- training at companies in England, Italy, Czech Republic and Slovenia. ECVET-possibilities are negotiated with Isle of Wight College in England and later with other partners as well. Business and administration students need more suitable VET-training companies, especially in England and Spain. For these reasons there will be more staff training and small group visits, especially the aforementioned countries. \r\nThe project includes mobilities for short-term mobility of VET-learners, staff training and teaching/training assignments abroad. Short-term mobility of VET-learners is divided into VET-training at companies abroad (duration 1-3 months) and smaller group visits to institutions abroad (duration 16 days) . If the students participating in VET-training abroad need more support at the beginning of their placement period, the small group visits will be planned to take place at the same time, to provide extra support from the tutor accompanying the group for the first 16 days. Small group visits are planned especially for the students with fewer opportunities, learning difficulties and poorer language skills. We have found this type of activity to be highly important for many of our students, who are not able to join VET-training with businesses. Staff training is planned and completed together with business representatives from Forssa region (Training assignments abroad). Combined mobility of staff and working life representatives increases the connections between school and businesses and helps develop new learning environments for all participants.

It will enable students in four new educational fields to complete work-based learning placements in Europe: Logistics, Pre-vocational training and IT/ICT. Mobilities will also continue in the fields of Horticulture, Catering, Domestic Services and Health&Social Care. Accompanying persons support students during the placements. The project includes also expert mobilities, aimed at updating and upscaling staff competences. In total the project includes 50 student, 22 accompanying persons as well as 8 expert mobilities. Project partners are vocational/second level colleges and private enterprises in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Estonia, Austria and Hungary.The first and primary goal of the project is to broaden KVC's students' opportunities for European mobility. This target is achieved by offering more students in a wider range of educational fields opportunities to complete 2-3 week work-based learning placements in other European countries. Placements will be completed in vocational/second level colleges and/or with industry employers. Students participating in the mobilities have additional support needs which relate to, for example, learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorder or long term mental health issues. Majority of students require support in the work place, free time as well as during travel. Previous experience has shown that the 2-3 week duration is sufficient for the students internationalisation needs, as well as being suitable for organising accompanying persons placements. The following impacts are expected: Improved professional/vocational skills and competences, language skills and levels of independence. Students multicultural awareness and knowledge also increase, making them better equipped to gain&sustain employment at a time when work communities in Finland are becoming more diverse. Students ability to use social media in a work/study context improves. Prior to placements students attend preparatory training sessions. Skills and competences acquired in the project are recognised as part of their qualifications and students will be given Europass Mobility -reference documents. The second main goal of the project is to use expert European mobility to update and upscale staff competences. Staff mobilities have been proven to increase skills and motivation for continuing with international activities also in the college, which positively affects all students. The expert mobilties in this project are 1-2 week job shadowing placements. The target group is teaching and supporting staff. The goal of the placements is for staff to learn about European models for vocational education, benchmark activities, network with European colleagues and improve language&multicultural competences. These skills are required for teaching and supporting of also an increasing number of non-native students in the college. European expert mobility supports the Finnish Special Needs Vocational Education and Training sectors to continue operating at a high standard internationally. The project will be marketed both internally and externally on local, regional and national levels, for example through the various networks Kiipula operates in. International projects coordinator will oversee the management of the project, supported by college management and finance team. Vocational teachers are responsible for the content of student placements, and partners for providing work place support, for example. Preparatory visits will be made to at least four of the partners. This is a two year project. Interim and final reports will be prepared according to funders instructions. Also participants will report on their experiences through the European Mobility Tool database.Broadening student and staff mobilities is in line with KVC's international strategy and action plan. Indicators used are both quantitative (amount of mobilities) and qualitative (staff and student competences). International work is linked to KVC's quality development, and it's also a part of the Ameo -network strategy. In National context, the project meets the goals outlined in the Finnish Development Plan for Education and Research (2011-16). In the plan, internationalisations is included as an integral part of vocational education, the indicators of which are increased student mobilities/work-based learning placements abroad as well as staff and management competences gained through international projects. The goal of this project is also to increase the amount of college based international activity. Kiipula's international contacts and networks will strengthen and broaden as a result of the project.

Since then we have successfully trained 16 staff across the curriculum and this year will send 12 students to Norway on work placements. The College recognises the far-reaching impact such experiences have had and how this can be extended further to include students and staff in other curriculum areas. The College set up a wheel of internationalisation (WOI) to identify 4 stages of international involvement and map these against each curriculum area, prioritising those areas whose students would most benefit from a European experience. This has formed the basis for the internationalisation of our curriculum and we are now entering an exciting stage where we are closer to achieving the final stage which is ECVET.\r\n\r\nIn this current project, we have identified our core curriculum as the next developmental stage for staff training in another European country.  This includes the Apprenticeships and Work-Based Learning team, and Maths teachers, all of which are seeking ways to be more innovative in the delivery and management of their programmes in order to improve skills and get more young people into work. Finland is recognised for its excellent education system so 5 members of these teams will travel to Savonlinna College in Finland to achieve the following:\r\n1. To share best practice with peers both in College and in other European countries.\r\n2. To broaden their knowledge of vocational training in Europe.\r\n3. To internationalise the College curriculum.\r\n4. To improve the teaching and learning of Maths in vocational areas by implementing new methodologies.\r\n5. To create a local labour market better-equipped to enter careers where contact with other cultures is necessary.\r\n6. To help prevent isolation and radicalisation of students.\r\n7. To raise the profile of the EU among young people on the Isle of Wight and what it means to be a European citizen.\r\n8. To learn how to implement measures to improve employer engagement.\r\n9. To learn how to motivate young people and employers to engage in the Apprenticeship system in the UK by sharing best practice.\r\n10. To understand the ECVET system and how this might be applied to College programmes of study.\r\n\r\nThe second strand of our project stems from a staff training visit by lecturers from Hospitality, Business and Travel and Tourism to Guadeloupe. There they recognised the benefits that might be gained by sending their students on a brief work placement in another country. However, they also recognised that most benefit would be gained from working in a large city rather than another island. Therefore we plan to send 30 students from these curriculum areas to Barcelona to learn about catering, hospitality, tourism and business in a major international city. Before the students go they will organise between them an awareness event about Barcelona and Spain generally to raise the profile of their visit in college and to help them complete the Event Management unit on their course. They will learn vocationally relevant Spanish and will complete the work placement element of their qualification. In addition Travel and Tourism students will complete a Travel Agency Day with the International Department in order to teach them the logistics of preparing a visit.\r\n\r\nOn their return, staff and students will make presentations to their peers, parents, schools and local employers in order to raise awareness of the benefits and positive impacts that the mobilities create.\r\n\r\nWe envisage that, as a result of this project we will have a better informed staff and student cohort who are more aware and better informed about the opportunities for working, living and studying in other European countries. Students participating in the mobilities will improve their linguistic competence and learn new skills which will help improve their confidence and their career opportunities due to their improved CVs. They will be more open to embracing different cultures and therefore less at risk of radicalisation. Staff will have learnt from their peers, exchanged ideas and shared best practice forming a basis for future sustainable collaboration with European partners.  Through their dissemination of their findings, participating staff can inform the College senior leadership team of best practice, providing them with the opportunity to consider implementing new strategies, which in turn will enhance the student experience and their future.\r\n\r\nIn the long term the impact of the dissemination of this project will lead to further internationalisation of all curriculum areas with student and staff exchanges.

Developing the quality of international activities in SAMI. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to supplement the vocational education, which is served in SAMI in the area of internationalization by offering training and mobility periods abroad for both students and teachers. Training contains linguistic and cultural training. On Line Language training and previously created linguistic and cultural training material and courses will be developed and tested during the project. Equality in internationalization actions should not depended on field of education, curriculum or the age of students. That is why there must be a possibility to have internationalization education for everybody. This kind of training course will be developed in this project. \r\nThe total number of mobilities for students is 60, divided equally among the students. \r\n\r\nTeachers mobility periods are the part of SAMI's staff training program. The demands of working ability\u2019s the teachers are the base of planning the mobility periods. As a result, the teachers will have new linguistic and working skills, which will affect positive way to the attitudes and values of the teachers concerning the international education and multicultural students.\r\nHowever, as a result of this project, the students receive a high-quality and equitable global education in their own classroom. The teacher is the leading person the international education whose attitude strongly affects especially the young students' attitudes \r\nThe total number of mobilities for students is 8, divided equally among the teachers. In addition, 2 mobilitys are applied for teachers professional development period of the 14 days.\r\n\r\nThere is a special need for developing the international mobility training, so that serves the skills for those students and teachers who will take part of mobility periods abroad. We want also to develop international training method and content of such that it can be to chosen by student who does not take part of mobility period, but seeks cross-cultural skills at home.", "http://www.iwcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FI01-KA102-008872_9"], [2014, "EuroAprendiendo FP1", "The Isle of Wight College", 58102.0, 4, 5, "The EuroAprendiendo FP1 Project encourages our students of Vocational Training to develope their Profesional Practices in Europe.\r\n\r\nGSD is a Cooperative Group since 1985 with over 15,000 students in the Community of Madrid.

Following successful training of Health and Social Care and Childcare teachers in France and Norway respectively in October 2015, the College recognised the far-reaching impact such training had had and how this could be extended to include students and staff in other curriculum areas. The College therefore set up a wheel of internationalisation (WOI) to identify 4 stages of international involvement and map these against each curriculum area, prioritising those areas whose students would most benefit from a European experience. This then formed the basis for both this and future projects. Stage one of the WOI is identifying potential relevant partners and stage two is staff training with a view to improving teaching and learning, exposing students to the European experience through teachers' new skills and learning resources and developing opportunities for future student mobilities. Stage three is student mobility and stage four is ECVET.For our Stepping Stones project the College has identified that our Childcare department is at stage three and 12 level 3 Childcare students accompanied by 3 staff will complete VET Traineeships at Birkebeineren Friluftsbarnehage in Norway. Here they will study with their Norwegian peers at a local college, carry out work placements at a local Forest School and primary schools, and gain a Forest School qualification. Accompanying staff will investigate opportunities for ECVET in order to establish a sustainable, long-term collaboration and move to stage four of the wheel.We have identified further curriculum areas who are at stage two of the WOI and would benefit from staff training in another European country.  They work with students who would most benefit from future European projects: Travel and Tourism, Hospitality and Catering, Engineering, Sport and work-based learning areas involved with vulnerable students who find it harder to get into work and therefore risk isolation and possible radicalisation. A total of 11 staff will travel to Lyc\u00e9e Professionnel Agostin ARRON in Guadeloupe, Gausdal Vidergaendeskole in Norway, Kiikula vocational college in Finland and the European Vocational Training Centre German Red Cross  Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany. Their objectives will be to:1. Share best practice with peers both in College and in other European countries.2. Broaden their knowledge of vocational training in Europe.3. Internationalise the College curriculum.4. Improve teaching and learning by implementing new methodologies.5. Create a local labour market better-equipped to enter careers where contact with other cultures is necessary.6. Help prevent isolation and radicalisation of students.7. Raise the profile of the EU among young people on the Isle of Wight and what it means to be a European citizen.8. Establish sustainable, long term partnerships which will enable their curriculum areas to move to stage three of the WOI.On their return, staff and students will make presentations to their peers, parents, schools and local employers in order to raise awareness of the benefits and positive impacts that the mobilities create.We envisage that, as a result of this project we will have a better informed staff and student cohort who are more aware and better informed about the opportunities for working, living and studying in other European countries. Students participating in the mobilities will improve their linguistic competence and learn new skills which will help improve their confidence and their career opportunities due to their improved CVs. They will be more open to embracing different cultures and therefore less at risk of radicalisation. Staff will have learnt from their peers, exchanged ideas and shared best practice forming a basis for future sustainable collaboration with European partners.  Through their dissemination of their findings, participating staff can inform the College senior leadership team of best practice, providing them with the opportunity to consider implementing new strategies, which in turn will enhance the student experience and their future.In the long term the impact of the dissemination of this project will lead to the internationalisation of all curriculum areas with student and staff exchanges. It will improve teaching and learning and help to develop an ethos in the College of open-mindedness towards Europe and the wider world, which in turn will impact positively on local ethnic communities.

The most demanding challenges in 2016 will be prolonging the mobility periods, renewing the coaching for the mobility and development of marketing.The need for longer mobility periods has increased in 2015. The students have noticed that internationalization is a long process. This application is only for 62-day-long mobilities with two partners, which we already know well.In 2016 weight will especially be put on coaching before the mobility period. Contact teaching will be increased and the quality of net material will be improved. Mobile games for coaching about Isle of Wight and Zaragoza will be made on HeiJoe game platform. Earlier we have made similar games about Tallinn and Savonlinna. The game about Savonlinna supports home internationalization, helps the tutors to integrate the exchange students to Savonlinna and it is also used in English lessons. With help of this game those students, who won't attend a mobility period wil have a contact with the guests of SAMIedu. All our studends blog in the address http://moprosamiedu.blogspot.fi/.

Young people who have a handicap - which is of a nature or gravity that makes special advancement necessary  in order to be able to successfully finish a vocational training \u2013 have a legal right to claim a vocational measure in a \u201cBerufsbildungswerk\u201d.The promoting organization of the Euro-BBW is the German Red Cross Rhineland-Palatinate. The Euro-BBW offers vocational orientation and training for ca. 250 young adults with (impending) mental disorder and/or physical disability, from Germany and the neighbouring countries like Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Netherlands.ObjectivesObjectives of the project BI2K are new professional stimuli and concepts by offering work shadowing to staff members. Knowledge of the work culture, labour market and training system of another European country will in turn lead to a quality improvement in training.Other aims are the improvement of intercultural competences, the enhancement of learning motivation and the improvement of English language skills. This should strengthen open-mindedness concerning other cultures and the ability to take the broader view.Within the context of the inclusion debate it is indispensable for staff of a European specialist training institution like the Euro-BBW to be informed about the practice of inclusion as well as inclusive didactical methods in other European countries, in order to be able to make use of the results. Undoubtedly the internationalisation of labour markets more and more requires intercultural competences and foreign language skills. MeasuresIn order to reach these goals, the Euro-BBW wants to allow for its staff members to learn abroad in the framework of the project BI2K.In 2016 and probably also in 2017, the Euro-BBW will send four staff members to the Isle of Wight College, Askham Bryan College and Newton Rigg College for work shadowing.A more intense exchange of good practice with our British partners is planned, too. The isle of Wight College will apply for a similar project to send staff members to the Euro-BBW, and Askham Bryan is planning for an exchange with the Euro-BBW in the near future. The participants will be chosen three months before travelling during an application process in the Euro-BBW, and they will be trained systematically in intercultural matters as well as concerning their language skills. Staff members will be employed in matching areas of the colleges. There will be a cultural program on offer during the whole stay.Expected ResultsThe Euro-BBW mainly expects the following results and effects of the project  BI2K:- enhancement of didactical competences - knowledge of corporate procedures on a foreign labour market- practical knowledge of a different, European rehabilitation system- improvement and enlargement of the Euro-BBW\u2019s  cooperation network- improvement of intercultural competences - improvement of foreign language skills - enhancement of motivation- enhancement of  mobility- enhancement of tolerance concerning foreignness- enhancement of toleranceIn the long run staff members will integrate best-practice approaches from other European countries into their teaching and leisure activities at the Euro-BBW.", "http://www.iwcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002984_1"], [2015, "Developing Staff and Students  in Health and Social Care", "The Isle of Wight College", 5832.0, 3, 3, "Our project is designed to provide training, in the areas of Childcare and Health and Social Care, for lecturing staff at the Isle of Wight College. We plan to send 3 lecturers to Norway to learn more about forest schools as this is something we are starting to develop on the Isle of Wight. Our childcare department is passionate about outdoor learning and we believe that we have the right environment here to introduce it. However, we lack some skills to ensure that it is developed sustainably and with maximum impact. Norway is ranked far higher than the UK in the Children's Society's worldwide happiness survey and it is thought that this is linked to outdoor learning. \r\n\r\nWe also plan to send 3 lecturers to France to a Maison Familiale Rurale to see how rural education is delivered and how parents and the local community are involved. We will investigate the compatibility of curricula and share good practice on work placement organisation and monitoring. Visiting staff hope to learn about student mobility and, ultimately, send UK students abroad on work placements.\r\n\r\nBoth strands of our project have been researched by staff and our partners selected according to their experience and what we can learn from them. We will prepare our lecturers, both culturally and linguistically, pre-visit and they will consult with our students and local employers concerning what they would like to learn about our partners. \r\n\r\nDuring the visits the lecturers will shadow their peers, visit work placements and discuss the education system and curriculum of the respective countries. On their return this information and their new found skills will be disseminated to the rest of their department, their students, local employers and the rest of the college.  We hope this will inspire more staff and students to take a more European approach to their teaching and learning. In our quest to encourage our students to become better European citizens, and more interested in living and working abroad, we see this project as the first step in a long-term goal to send our students abroad on work placements and ultimately enter into an ECVET project.", "http://www.iwcollege.ac.uk", "The Isle of Wight College", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012848_coordinator"]]}}, "5TG": {"nhs": {"data": [["R1F", "St Mary's Hospital", "nhs_R1F01"]]}}}}
