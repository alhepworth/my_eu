Invited participants are currently running local - and many cases international as well - projects addressing issues of minorities and frozen armed conflicts. Through the training they will be able on one hand to share their experiences, best practices but also to learn new techniques. \r\n\r\nThe program consist of three main pillars:\r\n- during the first part participants will explore what does culture of peace means, how can it be promoted and transmitted - the concept will be approached from various aspects from meditation, self-development to group discussions and sharing personal realities\r\n- the second pillar will empower participants to use non-violent communication and non-violent actions in their everyday work\r\n- the third pillar will be the shortest, but the most practical - it will focus on how to put into practice the results of the project with concrete steps\r\n\r\nThrough the preparation of the training - e-learning modules - we will make sure that participants has a common background and they are aware of the most important theories and organizations dealing with culture of peace.

At the same time, it is the young generation who will have to address and adapt to the unfolding consequences in the future. To empower these youngsters and facilitate a mental shift in their lives we count on a tool that has always been there for us, though in recent times we have relied less and less on it: we are talking about nature. Our connection with nature plays a major role in the quest of getting closer to our inner being, to our core. In order to create a positive change in our lifestyle without losing quality of life, we intend to bring participants back to their essence of who they really are, diving into their personal and inner life;  nature will be a part of this journey.\r\n\r\nThe target group of this training course are 24 youth workers, project leaders or educators, including anyone who is actively involved in youth work. With this training course we create a space for personal development in connection with nature through reflection on our concerns and passions as well as becoming more conscious of our personal learning process. We believe that gaining a deeper understanding of who we are and what we can do for others is an empowering process which can lead to positive changes for the future of society. Moreover it is necessary that youth workers know how they can support young people in facing their own challenges and thereby continue to grow as a person. After the training, participants are expected to adopt a multiplier role: they will lead young people in their home organisations and communities through a personal learning journey to craft and find powerful and meaningful responses to the challenges of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are:\r\n- To raise awareness of our identity through reflecting on our challenges, concerns, talents and passions.\r\n- To stimulate the creativity, vulnerability, confidence and resilience of the participants.\r\n- To explore alternative ways of living, in particular the exchange with nature, which gives us a new quality of life.\r\n- To develop a different Mindset, based on the values: mind, heart, body and environment, which serves us in our future.\r\n- To encourage and serve the participants in planning their learning process also after the training course and also implement with their own target groups: young persons in their organization and community.\r\n- To learn more about the Erasmus+ program and its actions, and Youth Pass as a tool of recognition of the key competences.\r\n\r\nThis training course will be based on non-formal and informal education with a self-directed learning approach. That means that the participants are responsible for their own learning and the facilitators provide activities and guide the participants through their own learning process. The training course will be characterised by highly participatory, interactive and experiential methods. The activities will include case studies, working in pairs and small groups, meditations, contemplations, team building activities, role plays (Theatre of Oppressed), outdoor education, discussions, and self-assessment. Some sessions will be completed by theoretical inputs and all of them will be followed by group reflection or self-reflection.\r\n\r\nThe main direct dissemination will be a good action from every participants after he/she returned back home and put the things he/she learned in practise. The participant can enrich their environment, in particular their organisation, because these \u2018good actions\u2019 will be inspired by the needs which were mentioned by the partners before the application of the project. The good actions are one of the evaluation tools and will be a part of the final report. \r\n\r\nAlready during the project the evaluation process will play an essential role in the learning process. Participants will meet everyday to discuss the progress of learning as well as group integration and group dynamics. There will also be a final evaluation of the project during the last day of training: besides a visible evaluation the participants will be asked to fill the questionnaire and evaluate the project, content, methods and trainers.

These were:\r\n(1) The provision of quality youth work incl. social impact measurement (Ireland)\r\n(2) The inclusion of NEETs (Lithuania) \r\n(3) Stimulating youth initiative and (social) entrepreneurship (Greece)\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of our project is to support youth initiatives in professionalising their work, in improving their impact, and thus in participating more effectively in the civic and democratic life of their communities. We focus on youth organisations working with marginalised youth, NEETs or young people threatened by unemployment and social exclusion. During our events we connect them to capacity building organisations that provide training and networking opportunities.\r\n\r\nOur needs analysis with partner organisations showed that in order to put the abovementioned recommendations into practice, we should develop a training programme tackling the following fields of action: \r\n\u2022 Boost the self-confidence of youth workers and young people to dare more to put their ideas into practice (attitude),\r\n\u2022 Improve the operative knowledge on the structures, policies and mechanisms - especially as regards European youth participation (knowledge) - and making results tangible through social impact measurement (skills),\r\n\u2022 Coach participants to follow through upon their ideas over time (action).\r\n\r\nIn short we ask one question only: \"Who do YOU dare to be and which IMPACT do you want to stand for?\"\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS, ACTIVITIES,  METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS\r\nThe Arc Training assembles 32 youth workers, volunteers and young (aspiring) social entrepreneurs from 12 countries and 19 different organisations. It is designed as an 8-day course taking place 23rd and 30th November 2014 in Lancastershire, UK. It also comprises a voluntary peer-to-peer post-coaching process lasting over a period of 6 months. \r\n\r\nOur methodology is rooted in the principles of non-formal education: Participants will be trained on the structures and mechanisms of European youth work. They will also be guided through a comprehensive coaching process where they will be given the opportunity to challenge their projects and develop an inspiring target which they are enthusiastic about reaching in the future. Towards the end of the training course a session on social impact measurement will empower them to add a quantitative dimension to the goal they wish to pursue. During the post-coaching process after the training, participants will not only be coached on realising their target, but to also on how to track their impact as a means for further internal improvement. \r\n\r\nWith The Arc Training we strive for the following impact as regards our participants: (a) increase in leadership skills, (b) increase in knowledge on EU structured and social impact measurement, (c) shift in attitude towards an outcome-oriented project management style, (d) an empowering experience of reaching an inspiring new goal for their project together with their coach. \r\nIn the long run the key competences developed during this process are also expected to increase their own employability and to significantly improve the work in their organisations at home.", "http://www.wpifoundation.org", null, "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA105-001536_16"], [2016, "Embodied Peacebuilding - Compassion in Action in a Changing World", "World Peace Initiative Ltd", 19418.0, 14, 15, "In current political and social situation with spreading nationalism, radicalization of the political and religious groups, it is essential that people are equipped with peace building skills, as well as understand themselves in midst of conflict and thus decide to act from place of tolerance and respect.

This training course was created to foster efficient leadership in peace building practices that meet the need of youth organizations to lead the way for more tolerance and respect in the face of growing xenophobia and fear for unknown future. It inspires young people to take responsibility in their hands and lead the way to build another strategy to maintain, spread and sustain peace in Europe and outside of it. This project will take place in Liepaja, Latvia and involve 31 full-time participants and experts from Croatia, Latvia, Spain, Italy, Lithuania, Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Austria, Hungary, Germany and Czech Republic - youth workers and group leaders, community facilitators and trainers who want to build the culture based on principles of solidarity, shared power, inclusion and peaceful existence.The course is based on non-formal and embodied learning principles and methods, while exploring how embodied learning approaches can be used in different realities within youth work and non-formal education. Participants will be empowered to address conflict and see peace building possibilities among groups of different races, religions, social and political backgrounds, as well as overcome difficulties and opinion differences in their own organizations. This course is unique as it combines verbal, non-verbal peace building approaches ,as well as gives tools for personal development work and exploration, so that peace building is embedded in every action of individual and organization and becomes integral part of it.Embodied learning methods contribute to both, professional and personal development of the learners, which means that through practices, activities and approaches used during this training course, participants will develop a centered presence - grounded way of being in their bodies and practicing leadership with the ability to act and respond to their own needs, as well as to the needs of others, the community and organizations.One of the main results of this project will be development and exchange of innovative learning methodologies in peace building. Participants will learn how to present peace building activities in their societies in a playful and creative way.  Since all partners want to expand their working scope in peace education, participants will be given methods to be used and adapted to their realities and implement local peace building initiatives within the framework of the project.  Thus the project will also foster cooperation among all partners, further developing and exchanging ideas and practices on peace building and embodiment, and contribute to strengthening peace in participants' communities.", "http://www.wpifoundation.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-LV02-KA105-001154_6"], [2014, "Ride a smile", "World Peace Initiative Ltd", 18871.0, 9, 9, "Smiling teraphy is an innovative approach in education with the aim to lead people toward a positive actitude to life.

Different elements configure this competence of a youth leader: to do it precise, empathic, nonviolent, involving and adapted to the audience, the context and the different styles of learner.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, the overall aim of the Training Course is to increase youth workers capacities to communicate and to transfer messages in their work with youngsters, as well as to reflect and increase the self-awareness of each individual\u2019s communication style, specially in the youth work areas.\r\n\r\nMore precisely, the objectives of the Training Course are:\r\n\u2022 To explore and understand different techniques of communication, with special focus in youth work;\r\n\u2022 To provide a safe space to practice and develop personal competences in public speaking with youth;\r\n\u2022 To practice different types of communication with youngsters -one to one, with groups, during team meetings, for campaigning, on conflict/crisis, etc.-\r\n\u2022 To integrate the logics of nonviolent communication as a transversal element and apply it;\r\n\u2022 To develop projects addressing communication issues in organizations and communities.\r\n\r\nA variety of educational tools and methods of non-formal learning and interactive participant orientated approaches as role plays, simulations, workshops, exercises theatre tools, debate sessions and presentations will be combined during the Activity.\r\n\r\nStrongly connected with the educational outcomes of the activity, the expected impacts are:\r\n\r\n- Participants gain capacity to communicate in their daily work with youth and youth organizations;\r\n- Participants understand the different types of communication and its challenges, peculiarities;\r\n- Participants develop their general communication competences and increase their leadership.\r\n- Participants develop their capacities as project manager/leaders and gain skills to implement future actions;\r\n- Participants develop their international network of young leaders or youth workers, and are connected with them for future actions.\r\n- Members of the organizations gain capacities to communicate in the field of youth and at organizational level;\r\n- Organizations enhance their international network and establish the base for future cooperation amongst them;\r\n- Organizations gain visibility and international recognition thanks to their participation in an activity of this type.\r\n\r\nThe Training Course will take place in The Netherlands on a Dutch island (Schiermonnikoog, Ameland or Terschelling) from the 15th until the 23rd of April 2015. 24 participants from Spain, Hungary, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, The United Kingdom and Bulgaria will gather during 7 days, excluding travel days.", "http://www.wpifoundation.org", null, "erasmus_2014-3-NL02-KA105-000813_2"], [2016, "Peace Leaders+", "World Peace Initiative Ltd", 15582.0, 12, 12, "The training course \u201cPeace Leaders+\u201d will be held in Lecce, Italy from 23-30 April 2017 and will gather 25 participants from Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Sweden, Romania, Italy, Austria, Greece, Denmark, Bulgaria, Slovakia and United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nErasmus+ has great opportunities for young people all over Europe, which means it is open for different youth associations to organize various international projects, especially youth exchanges. All young people who are or become involved in the Erasmus+ programme develop their skills as perfect future youth leaders. Project Peace Leaders+ is based on the belief that group leaders of youth are able to increase the quality of Erasmus+ youth exchanges by finding appropriate models to motivate youth to actively participate in the youth exchange and thus gain new skills and knowledge. The main idea is to find this form of motivation where the group leader is not a teacher or superior but instead plays an active role of a facilitator who knows how to successfully involve and motivate youngsters. Following this model, the people assisting youngsters during international projects are helping, step by step, to also achieve the aims of the European Union and its values. \r\n\r\nThe training course has been designed based on the actual needs of the partners after several previous discussions and previous cooperation. Too often youth workers use the same methods in their work and this influences the quality and progress of any youth exchange. Therefore we see the need to improve and also assist the improvement of other youth leaders. The projects aims to assist and help current or future group leaders to develop their competences and become more active in the field of international youth work. We suggest to promote and facilitate an active approach which will help youth leaders to come up with good ideas and find new appropriate models to motivate youth, provide appropriate learning support, to stimulate young people\u2019s spirit of initiative, creativity and entrepreneurship. It will show the youth leaders how to improve their strategies for motivating youngsters and through their self-evaluation find new ways and methods for future projects.  Participants of the training course will have an opportunity to create appropriate models aimed at involving youngsters to initiate work and be proactive in their communities by themselves. We aim to achieve it by bringing back the youth leader to his first steps and facilitate their self-assessment as a group leader. By using interactive and non-formal methods (brainstorming, group works, simulation, role play, open group discussion, open space for reflection etc), the participants will become highly involved in the project and will develop their leadership skills and practical knowledge. The exact methods used will be adapted by the trainers based on the selected participants\u00b4 profiles to guarantee successful learning process of each participants.

Since the group leaders are prepared to work within an international environment it is also important to give them an international environment to apply their skills.

Nonetheless, information is not enough. Questions and issues regarding sexuality and relationships are essentially a question of identity. With this training course we want to extend the subject of sexuality beyond information and widen the perspective of the matter and connect sexuality to identity and discover values and norms in connection to sexuality on a societal, European, national and personal level.The overall aim of creating a safe environment where this topic can be discussed is to help young people to find their \u201dinner compass\u201d that can facilitate choices and guide them to manage different life situations. Moreover, the inner compass can help young people to discover and understand themselves. Further youth workers can play an important role in establishing a context and making life comprehensible for young people. \r\nThe policies and praciticies of sexual pedagogy varies across Europe. There is a need among youth workers to explore how sexuality is connected to identity and at the same time learn tools, methods and approaches in connection to sexuality which they can use in their youth work. \r\n\r\nAim:\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the TC is to increase awareness among youth workers of the inner process and inner compass from a holistic approach (body, mind and heart) in connection to sexuality and identity, and to develop the capacity in supporting young people to explore this.\r\n\r\nObjectives: \r\n- Discover  which norms we have in connection to sexuality and identity  \r\n \r\n- Investigate  how society and myself sees sexuality and how it influence young  people\r\n \r\n- Raise  awareness of your own identity in general and resources\r\n \r\n- Learn  how to express sexuality in words/communication and attitude\r\n \r\n- Explore  how sexuality is seen in different European cultures\r\n \r\n- Discover  tools and methods of sexual pedagogy with youngsters \r\n\r\nThe Training course will take place in Munkviken, Sweden between the 3/4-10/4 2015 and will consist of 22 participants from ten different European Union member countries. \r\nThis training course will be based on non-formal and informal education with a self-directed learning approach.

The working methods will include case studies, working in pairs and small groups, team building activities, role plays, discussions, workshops developed by the participant and self-assessment.\r\nThe participants will go home with all the theory as well as the outcomes of the exercises during this TC. They are stimulated to spread what they learn in their own practise and share it with colleagues from elsewhere. Hopefully they are inspired to do the same exercises with their target groups, youngsters. We will create a dropbox with all the materials, handouts, pictures, movies, tools, useful links etc and share it with the participants and the partner organizations. Through this, the project result will be dissememinated.
