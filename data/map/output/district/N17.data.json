The challenges of integrating newcomers in local communities and in society are real, however, seeing migrants and refugees as a potential and not a threat is essential to build on their assets, their added value and new opportunities they can be part of.\r\nEurope has always been multicultural and it is clear that we will live in an increasing multicultural setting in the future. The policies of how to manage diversity to support the potential of people of all backgrounds, specifically young migrants and refugees, will determine the future of Europe. The project \"Welcomeship - Building inclusive communities through community-based entrepreneurship\u201d addresses these questions. The \"WELCOME - SHIP\u201d project combines the two concepts of \u201cfostering a WELCOME culture\u201d with \u201cEntrepreneurSHIP Learning\u201d. The main objective of the project is to develop and pilot the \"Welcomeship\" model of inclusion which closes the gap in collaboration and dialogue between the local residents, local young people, as well as migrants and refugees. The project fosters community spirit and provides young people with specific skills through community-based entrepreneurship learning so that they become active contributors to the society and communities where they live.\r\nThe \u201cWelcomeship\u201d model along with its working tools will be developed and piloted in 7 communities of 6 European countries in 5 languages, and the results are made available by the Consortium of partners and associate partners to the audience inside as well as outside the European Union. \r\nIn this project youth workers from Germany, Sweden, Finland, UK, Portugal and Italy are trained to become entrepreneurship trainers. They will deliver a community-based entrepreneurship course of 5 Modules to 150 young migrants and refugees and local young people with fewer opportunities who will directly collaborate with community stakeholders to implement entrepreneurial projects. Furthermore, 400 local stakeholders, policy makers and other young people will participate in project activities, such as Welcomeship Nights, and in projects developed by young people. \r\nOther key activities of the project include European-wide peer learning and online exchange of young people, coaching sessions with trainers, as well as international partner meetings, a training of trainers, a blended mobility event for young people, production of 5 Intellectual Outputs and multiplier events in 8 countries and 9 communities.\r\nThe Intellectual Outputs are the Learning Kit for trainers and for young people, a community-based Entrepreneurship Course delivered online and through local workshops, a video-based Tutorial Programme, a Guidebook for Inclusive Communities and the Welcomeship Channel \u2013 project platform for learning, exchange, dissemination and advocacy work. The project strives to involve policy makers in discussion and designing more inclusive policies for young migrants and refugees across Europe, in particular in the field of entrepreneurship. \r\nThe Welcomeship project is multi-dimensional and based on non-formal learning methods. Project\u2019s target groups are young people with fewer opportunities, including local youth, migrants and refugees; youth workers, community stakeholders and policy makers. In the course of the project, young people will gain entrepreneurial skills, build their confidence and become more integrated and engaged in their communities; youth workers will become competent trainers and community oriented professionals with a high skill level in entrepreneurship teaching for the specific target group; partner organizations become engines of inclusion within their community and community stakeholders and policy makers will be involved in the project activities to design and support more inclusive policies at local as well as regional and international level.", "http://www.ubele.org", null, "erasmus_2017-3-DE04-KA205-015779_4"], [2017, "European Summer School: Towards resilient communities", "THE UBELE INITIATIVE", 128731.0, 3, 4, "Our project - European Summer School: Building resilient communities - will provide training in community leadership and capacity building to small, mainly BME organisations.

At the same time, while political rights of women are embodied in the laws of most countries, they are not applied in practice and women continue to be under-represented in political decision-making, in public office and in the civil service. Factors contributing to this are numerous, including historical, cultural, ideological influences, as well as the specific economic and social circumstances of young people and it is clear that legislative actions (e.g. quotas, parity thresholds, targets, etc.) in parties and institutions are not sufficient to ensure gender parity, even less to ensure truly representative processes.

This changing attitude should start from civil society to change political culture from the grassroots.

However, youth often express that they need to improve their skills and capacities so that their projects can have long-lasting impacts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIM & ACTIVITIES\r\nThe Youth Changemakers Training2: Learning and Sharing for Ecological Sustainability, Community Resiliency and Personal Agency (YCT2) responds directly to the youth demands expressed above. As such, the aim of this project is:\r\n\r\nTo increase the capacities of youth to effect long-lasting social and ecological change in their\r\ncommunities and internationally.\r\n\r\nThe YCT2 is specifically designed for 16 youth from 7 different EU and Mediterranean countries who are actively involved in and/or deeply committed to social and ecological change initiatives. Special attention will be paid to ensuring the participation of disadvantaged youth who meet this criteria.\r\n\r\nThe three learning activities and one ongoing learning activity of YCT2 are:\r\n1. Preparation Phase: Online learning modules\r\n2. Main Activity: One-month bilingual participatory training\r\n3. Follow-Up Phase: Local community presentation and engagement\r\n4. Ongoing activity: Learner-centred monitoring and evaluation\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR MODULES & OBJECTIVES\r\nThe four specific dimensions and the overall training will be certified by five separate organisations. The details of each certified dimension are:\r\n\r\n1. Facilitation & Community Engagement, 60 hrs\r\n\u00b7 To harness soft skills in community building and advocacy.\r\n\r\n2. Indigenous & Systems Worldview, 44 hrs\r\n\u00b7 To deepen the understanding and appreciation of holistic and sustainable worldviews.\r\n\r\n3. Alternative Economies, 44 hrs\r\n\u00b7 To explore the creation of alternative economies and alternative currencies.\r\n\r\n4. Permaculture Design, 76 hrs\r\n\u00b7 To develop hard skills and foundational knowledge about environmental sustainability.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon completion, participants will receive three recognized national and international certificates such as Intercultural Dialogue (Uniterra Catalunya), Design in Permaculture (Resilience.Earth SCCL) and Transition and Community Resilience (Transition Towns Network).\r\n\r\n\r\nINNOVATIVE METHODOLOGIES\r\n1. Transformative Teaching Methodology (TTM)\r\nTrainers will use TTM because it is a very effective teaching & empowerment methodology when working with youth. TTM includes techniques such as popular education, group problem solving, cooperative games & mind-mapping.\r\n\r\n2. Innovative Project Planning & Management\r\nExpert trainers & practioners will teach participants how to innovatively design & execute projects.\r\n\r\n3. Systemic Transnational Networking\r\nYouth participants & partner organisations will be engaged in multiple networking activities that are theme-based & goal-oriented.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED IMPACTS\r\n- Youth leaders have a greater capacity to effect long-lasting social and ecological change in their communities.\r\n- Trainers draw ideas and inspiration from existing social & ecological change initiatives from across Europe and the Mediterranean.\r\n- Resilience.Earth ad partner organisations are more inspired and empowered to continue engaging and leading transnational initiatives for social and ecological change.\r\n- Resilience.Earth and partners new to ERASMUS+ have more knowledge and experience about mobility opportunities offered by the programme and can impulse new projects in the future.\r\n- Stakeholder certification entities have a greater understanding of collaborative certification trainings.\r\n- Local and regional communities experience a growth in social and ecological change work.\r\n- National and international communities increase their awareness of social and ecological issues and solutions", "http://www.ubele.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES02-KA105-011006_5"]]}}, "8DP": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Auslandspraktikum 2014", "Awaiting Eyes Foundation", 27039.0, 5, 10, "Alongside the AIK Fachschulen gGmbH there will be nine different companies operating together in the EU mobility project Erasmus+ 2014.

Children from poor families are unlikely to get support from their parents/carers and are at a higher risk of becoming early leavers. In some cases, parents are intimidated by the school system because of their negative educational experiences or because they were educated outside of the local system. \r\nOther barriers are lack of expectations for their children, work and childcare commitments and lack of confidence. People from poor families particularly from migrant and refugee communities are at a significant disadvantage.  Structured creative arts activities, developed with the involvement of the target group and delivered in a non-formal environment, can provide life changing opportunities; they will help beneficiaries to gain new skills and enable them to become aware of the skills they already have; boost self-confidence; and instill a positive attitude to learning. Some parents do not understand the value or the role the arts can play in improving young people\u2019s achievement and employability skills, and undervalue their own creative skills. The Family Threads project aims to help break down the barriers and attitudes that result in young people dropping out of education and deny better career opportunities and social mobility; and also to enable parents and carers to realise their own potential as advisors, educators and a resource for their children.   \r\nEach of the partners has identified specific challenges which they feel are imperative to address around the issue of family learning and which include the importance of family talk, enabling families to discuss common topics so that children can develop both listening and speaking skills.  Although a well-developed concept, it is often poorly executed. It is essential to address this problem as families do require the support and opportunities that this project seeks to develop.\r\nThe Learning Families project will target primary school children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are at risk of leaving school early because their parents are not able to help them with their school work and do not have high expectations for their children\u2019s achievement. The partners will devise methodologies and techniques that will help to develop a strategic approach to tackle this problem as opposed to the common practice of intervening in a fragmented and uncoordinated manner.

Based on a joint investigation  they found that MRS parents  are not always able to support their children in their use of Internet as they themselves do not always have  the appropriate skills, knowledge and experience.  Existing information on Internet use of children, is not appealing to them and sometimes not understandable  because of language used.

In the 5th raid we have selected partners with long experience in mobilities, in 3 countries: Italy, Malta and United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe consider participation in the student mobility program as a priority for internships in companies-Erasmus + to promote interculturality, cooperation, skills, and insertion of our students in the labor market.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the quality of the students' interships, the institution will make a selection of them through a fair, transparent and inclusive process following the principles of equality, merit and ability.\r\n\r\nWith the participation of our students in the Erasmus + program, we intend to achieve the following results:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Improve the quality and attractiveness of VET.\r\n\u2022 Improve the employment possibilities of students in the international market.\r\n\u2022 Enhance the sense of initiative and the entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n\u2022 Improve the linguistic, technological and cultural skills of the participants\r\n\u2022 Improve the knowledge of the European project and the values of the EU.\r\n\u2022 Increase the awareness of European companies on the importance of lifelong learning.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the preparation of practical and logistical issues, project management and preparation of the participants, we can conclude with the following:\r\n\r\n1. Previously to the start of the mobility:\r\n\u2022 We will sign a collaboration agreement with the internship companies (host partner).\r\n\u2022 Both entities will plan an individualized training program that details the skills and abilities that students should acquire during the internships.\r\n\u2022 We will carry out an insurance for each of the participants.\r\n\u2022 We will be responsible for managing air transport.\r\n\u2022 The intermediary partners will manage the accommodation and the welcome process at the airport.\r\n\r\n2. During the period of mobility\r\n\u2022 We will have a fluent communication between all the participants of the project (tutor of the educational center, student and tutor of the company) through the different types of communication to carry out an exhaustive monitoring of the mobility.\r\n\u2022 The student must upload to our platform a weekly record with the activities carried out in the company signed by the tutor.\r\nThe project consists of 7 periods:\r\na) Previous period of project preparation Dec. 2017-January 2018)\r\nb) Communication period to all members of the school community (February 2018 - October 2018)\r\nc) Selection period of the participants (November 2018)\r\nd) Preparation period of the selected students (Dec. 2018-March 2019)\r\ne) Mobility period of internships in companies from EU countries (April-June 2019)\r\nf) Mobility evaluation period (April-July 2019)\r\ng) Project dissemination period (Dec. 2017-indefinite)\r\n\r\n3. Once the interships are finished:\r\n-The company will send a certificate that will assess the development of them by the student.\r\n- It will be the tutor of the educational center who, with the received documentation, will be in charge of evaluating the Work-Placement Training. For the assessment of the competences acquired by the participants during their experience abroad, the Europass Mobility will be used as an instrument.\r\n-The dissemination of this project will be made through the available means: Value Platform, Website, Blog, Social Networks, orientation talks, press releases, and institutional advertising.", "http://www.italoeuropeo.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-048293_2"], [2017, "PR\u00c1CTICAS DE FP EN EUROPA", "International communication services Ltd ( italoeuropeo & LondonONEradio)", 44110.0, 5, 12, "The SCM Teide-Hease consists of three different state-subsidised Vocational Training Schools in the Comunidad de Madrid. The school teaches in 3 different levels of education. In 2015, it was awarded by the Management System with the European Seal of Excellence 500+ points. In 2013, a new Strategy Plan was written whose main purpose was to modernize and internationalize Vocational Training. \r\nOur landmarks can be described as follows:  \r\n-2013: a committee was created by 3 directors in order to standardize Work-Placement Training in EU.\r\n-2014: a committee was formed with 9 people and worked on the proposal for KA102 (9 mobilities, 4 partners, 3 countries) and the Erasmus Charter for Higher Education Application. Both of these projects have been APPROVED.\r\n-2015: the same committee continues. We increased our partners;  wrote the KA102 project (12 mobilities, 6 partners and 5 countries) and KA103 (10 mobilities) with 2 new English-speaking countries.  These projects were APPROVED and 9 internships successfully managed.\r\n-2016: the same committee continues. Projects KA102 and KA103 were APPROVED and 12 internships successfully managed.\r\n-2017: the same committe continues working together. We are managing 22 granted mobilities. Projects KA102 and KA103 have been written.\r\nWork-Placement Training, carried out in companies, is part of these Cycles. Traineeships carried out in the EU must have the validity as in our country since Vocational Training is an instruction assessed by competences. Thus, no additional procedure shall be required.\r\nThe main purpose of our project is that 12 students in Intermediate Vocational Training have the opportunity to carry out their traineeships in different EU countries. In our fourth incursion, we have chosen well experienced partners in mobilities, located in 4 countries: Italy, Malta, the United Kingdom and Czech Republic.\r\nWe consider our students as priority in terms of participation in Erasmus+ in order to foster interculturality, cooperation, competences and to offer experience and integration into the labour market.\r\nThus, the school will draw up a shortlist of qualified candidates in order to ensure the quality of our students\u2019 training in work placements, in a transparent and fair way, taking into account equality, their academic merits and abilities.\r\nWith the participation of our students in Erasmus+, this proposal will aim to achieve the following results:\r\n\u2022 Improving the quality and attractiveness of Vocational Education and Training.\r\n\u2022 Increasing our students\u2019 job opportunities in the international labour market.\r\n\u2022 Promoting the sense of initiative and the entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n\u2022 Strengthening linguistic, technological and cultural skills.\r\n\u2022 Increasing EU knowledge and values.\r\n\u2022 Raising enterprise\u2019s awareness and the importance of lifelong learning.\r\nRegarding the practical and logistical preparation, we can conclude with the following comments:\r\n1. Before mobility: \r\n\u2022 Our school will come to a collaboration agreement with the companies where they are going to do their placements.\r\n\u2022 Both entities will plan an individualized training program in which will appear the different abilities students must obtain during their mobility.\r\n\u2022 Our school will provide students with insurance.\r\n\u2022 Our entity will be responsible for students\u2019 flight transportation. \r\n\u2022 Our receiving partners will be responsible for arranging of accommodation, airport pick-up service and organising students\u2019 welcome week during the first week.\r\n2. During mobility:\r\n\u2022 Our school and our partners will keep a smoothly flowing communication that will allow a constant exchange of opinions among the school tutor, the students and the school tutor of the hosting organisation by different means of communication.\r\n\u2022 The sending student must upload a file weekly in which will appear all the activities done by the student and signed by the student\u2019s tutor in the receiving company.\r\na)  Pre-preparation stage (Dec 16-Jan 17)\r\nb)  Communication stage at all the members of the school community (Feb 17-Oct17)\r\nc)   Selection process stage (Nov17)\r\nd)   Preparation of students stage (Dec17-Mar18)\r\ne)   Training stage in European countries (Apr-Jun 18)\r\nf)    Assessment stage (Apr-Jul 18)\r\ng)   Dissemination of results stage (Jan17-Dec 18)\r\n3. After mobility:\r\n\u2022 Once training in work placements is completed, the company will send a certificate in which our student\u2019s development in the company will be assessed.\r\n\u2022 Once the student\u2019s tutor receives the documentation provided by the hosting organisation, he/she will assess the activities carried out by the student in the work placement according to the assessment tool Europass\r\nThe dissemination of the results of the actions undertaken within the project will be published in different resources such as our school\u2019s website and blog, Plataforma Valor and social networks.
