Wind energy is the cheapest and technologically most straightforward way to generate the majority of this energy. As a result for this the amount of wind energy installed in the EU is predicted to increase from its current level of 56,000 MW to 300,000 MW by 2030, equating to the installation of over 80,000 wind turbines. Due to the very large radar cross section of the turbines and the motion of the rotating blades, these turbines have a detrimental effect on civilian radar navigations systems and there is growing concern about the potential problems which wind turbines may have on passenger safety. Due to space limitations, wind turbines are increasingly being located in areas close to the main shipping lanes and aviation flight paths and wind farm planning applications are increasingly being rejected. As a result of the radar interference issues, wind energy companies are desperately looking for a solution. Although both electronic radar solutions and the use of Radar Absorbing Materials (RAMs) coated onto the turbines have been considered, no cost-effective solution has as yet been produced. Current RAMs are far too expensive and their performance is not sufficient for wind turbine applications. The proposed \u2018OSGRAM\u2019 project will develop an innovative continuous process for the production of intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs) whose radar absorbing properties can be accurately tailored. The ICPs will be used to produce a multilayer RAM that can achieve radar attenuation of 20dB  in the S- and X-bands and which can be applied to wind turbine towers, nacelles and blades with a weight of <4kg/sq.m and a cost of 125(Euros)/sq.m.  This will allow our SME consortium to develop world-leading RAMs, giving us global market leadership and leading to sales in excess of 80 million Euros 5 years after the project ends and increase profits across the consortium.", 136885.0, 1059925.0, 5, 9, "OSGRAM", "http://www.osgram.eu", "http://www.hitek-ltd-co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58322.jpg", "fp7_92308_995655628"]]}}, "3DU": {"life": {"data": [[2012, "LIFE Little Terns - Improving the conservation status of the little tern in the UK through targeted action at the most important colonies", "Royal Society for the Protection of Birds", 2668804.0, 1334402.0, "The decline in the population of the little tern (<i>Sterna albifrons</i>) in the UK since the 1990s is a cause for concern. The principal threat to this shore nesting species is from human disturbance. After a decline between the 1930s and 1960s, the population recovered through protection and surveillance by wardens of breeding sites. However, in recent years the population has fallen again due to a range of factors, including disturbance, predation, habitat change and high tides linked to summer storms. There has been a reduction in the number of colonies, a loss of range in the west of the UK and, in general, there are poor levels of productivity. Sea-level rise also poses a threat to a number of current colonies. The total UK population is estimated to be less than 2 000 breeding pairs. The project will be the first nationally co-ordinated programme of action for the species, working with 29 colonies (about 65% of the total population) in 15 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) of the Natura 2000 network.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=4755", "http://www.littleternproject.org.uk/,", "life_105"], [1999, "saline lagoons  - Conserving saline lagoons & their birds on ten Natura 2000 sites in England", "Royal Society for the Protection of Birds", 1108104.0, 554051.0, "Saline lagoons are a priority habitat under the Habitats Directive and now total just 1300 hectares within the UK.  They are subject to ongoing degradation and loss through natural and man-induced processes.  Threats include development pressure, pollution, erosion, disturbance and disruption to salinity and water exchange processes.  \n\nSaline lagoons also provide nesting sites for internationally significant concentrations of terns (Sterna spp.) and gulls (Larus spp.) and feeding and roosting sites for migrant populations of waders and wildfowl.  Breeding populations of the avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta, an Annex I bird, are virtually confined to this habitat in the UK.  Threats specific to the bird populations present on the sites include vegetation encroachment, erosion, predation and human disturbance. \n\nBecause of the importance of the habitat, a saline lagoons action plan has been established as part of the UK\u2019s Biodiversity Action Plan.
