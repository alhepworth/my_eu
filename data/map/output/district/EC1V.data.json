The aim is to make such a system available to provide energy needs for domestic and small commercial applications. For larger energy needs, the units can be stacked by virtue of their modular nature. It can be integrated with medium and long term energy storage and/or co-firing with conventional fuels. The primary technical challenge is to enable the production of small scale cost effective, efficient, reliable and easy to maintain units. To achieve these objectives, research and development will be conducted in all aspects of the system leading to a full scale demonstration. The parabolic dish concentrator technology will be improved to reduce weight, improve tracking system and increase concentration ratio. A receiver suitable for this application will be optimised. This requires the development of absorption materials and improving heat transfer and cooling technology. A novel feature of this project is the replacement of the Stirling engine which is typically used in this size of application, to convert thermal energy to mechanical power, with an MGT. Stirling engines suffer from problems such as high cost, complexity and poor reliability. A recently developed MGT will be optimised in conjunction with the CSP system.

This proposal will launch a knowledge-transfer programme between industries and Universities for designing durable fuel injection systems through use of existing as well as newly developed CFD models that will build upon those currently used by the industrial partners. These models will include effects not captured so far but believed to be of imperative importance: the prediction of cavitation surface erosion occurring upon collapse of cavitation bubbles. The new models will account for the effect of extreme pressure and temperature developing instantaneously at the time of bubble collapse. In addition, the heat produced during the fast acceleration of the fuel as it flows through the injection holes can result to flow boiling and thus, significantly alter the heat transfer characteristics between the flowing fluid and the metal of the injector.

Cavitation erosion when experienced, normally leads to significant additional repair and maintenance costs or component replacement.  Even if erosion problems can be avoided by design or operation, most often the performance of the systems is sub-optimal because countermeasures by design are needed to prevent cavitation problems.

Software practitioners can earn a certificate for expertise in a certain hardware or software technology. The maturity of crucial IT processes, such as software development, can be and is often certified. Even individual software systems can be certified as having particular non-functional properties, including safety, security or privacy. However, the latter type of certification (e.g. Common Criteria) has had only a limited use to this day. Current trends in the IT industry suggest that software systems in the future will be very different from their counterparts today, due to greater adoption of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) and the wider spread of the deployment of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). These trends point to large-scale, heterogeneous ICT infrastructures hosting applications that are dynamically built from loosely-coupled, well-separated services, where key non-functional properties like security, privacy, and reliability will be of increased and critical importance. In such scenarios, certifying software properties will be crucial. Current certification schemes, however, are either insufficient in addressing the needs of such scenarios or not applicable at all and thus, they cannot be used to support and automate run-time security assessment.

Such concerns arise from the difficulty to guarantee security properties of the different types of services available through clouds. Service providers are reluctant to take full responsibility of the security of their services once the services are uploaded and offered through a cloud. Also, cloud suppliers have historically refrained from accepting liability for security leak.. This reluctance stems from the fact that the provision and security of a cloud service is sensitive to changes due to cloud operation, as well as to potential interference between the features and behavior of all the inter-dependent services in all layers of the cloud stack. Still many cloud users, including institutional ones, would  like to rely on cloud-based services they use to exhibit certified security properties.CUMULUS will address these limitations by developing an integrated framework of models, processes and tools supporting the certification of security properties of infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS) and software application layer (SaaS) services in cloud.

In addition, functional decline in iAMD, as well as, specific risk factors for iAMD progression to late stage AMD need to be better characterized to inform and improve conduct of future iAMD CTs.\nAgainst this background, the major objective of MACUSTAR is to develop novel clinical endpoints for CTs with a regulatory and patient access intention in patients with iAMD.

This is particularly true in post-secondary education and research. It is therefore surprising that the level of information literacy of students is low in many cases, as existing studies (some of them conducted at the University of Graz and University of Zadar) report.There might be several explanations for this: In many cases college curricula do not include content aiming at the development of information literacy. Often libraries are involved in teaching information literacy, in some cases academics embed some information literacy elements in their courses. However, since the concept of information literacy is widely unknown outside the information science community, a broad basis that can be used in courses but also by teachers and students on their own should be provided. Accordingly, the main outcome of our project will be a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for developing information literacy focusing on higher education students. A MOOC will provide opportunities for a very broad audience. MOOCs are online courses with no entry barriers aiming at unlimited participation. As open source software solutions are available for MOOCs, the project can focus on developing the content of the course and the accompanying research. Although information literacy consists also of subject-specific elements (for instance, different disciplines usually use different information resources), our MOOC will concentrate on information literacy elements which are relevant for all subjects/disciplines. Examples for such general information literacy elements are Boolean operators, basic principles in knowledge organization, or basic knowledge in copyright law. Accordingly, the first main task of the project will be the joint agreement on the detailed (non-subject specific) content of the MOOC. After having agreed on the content, the MOOC will be implemented in five (six) languages (English, German, Spanish and Catalan, Slovenian and Croatian). Addressing three of the largest language groups in Europe, the MOOC will be available to many citizens with different native languages. Moreover, it will be one of the first MOOCs available in Slovenian and Croatian and as such provide a new innovative model for MOOC development in these two languages/countries. The fact that we will start the implementation in the different languages after having agreed on the common content, will enable us to investigate cultural and language specific differences of the various realizations. Research findings stress the existence of different learning and teaching styles in different cultural and linguistic environments. At the moment research on addressing these factors with MOOCs developed in several languages is lacking.Currently, there are already several information literacy teaching materials available on the internet. However, probably one of the main shortcomings of these information literacy courses is that they usually do not provide (self-) assessments. Therefore, a central innovative approach of our MOOC will be the implementation of technology based assessment components. Right now,  lecturers and librarians who teach information literacy skills are investing resources in creating very similar materials on topics such as Boolean operators or plagiarism that could be built and shared collaboratively. The MOOC would allow them to take advantage of the economies of scale by using a common tool useful for all of them.As mentioned above, information literacy also covers subject-specific elements. For instance, there are other information resources relevant for business administration than for medicine. Since it would be much too ambitious, and even unrealistic, to consider all subject-specific aspects, we will demonstrate how the extension of our \u201cgeneral\u201d information literacy MOOC with subject-specific elements could work. This will be done for the disciplines of business administration (University of Graz) and psychology (University of Zadar). Later on, after completion of our project, these extensions could be conducted for other disciplines.", "http://www.city.ac.uk ", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA203-016762_5"], [2014, "Networked Activities for Realization of Innovative Products", "THE CITY UNIVERSITY", 208123.0, 4, 4, "Design researchers acknowledge five trends of the industrial design practice that emerge from the changing global environment: (1) emerging new technology increases the use of digital media; (2) the boundary between design disciplines is fuzzy; (3) there is a need for multidisciplinary teamwork; (4) there is a movement trend from individual product to systems; (5) there is an increasing dependence on online resources. The main goal of this project is to tech and learn design the above mentioned trends and to train engineering students transversal skills on real industrial cases of new product development (NPD) provided by industrial partners to foster the cooperation between the students, academia and industry. Besides, updates and developments are being carried out on the design methodology and its application in design education accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe project proposes 3 consecutive but unique and independent, industrial oriented courses of NPD in virtual environment; each will be organized by one of project partners in collaboration of all others. The collaboration will include state-of-the-art lectures given concurrently and interactively to students of all involved universities using professional video-conferencing equipment. Students\u2019 project activities will represent the practice in course; students will work on NPD assignment given by selected industrial partner. The project purposefully focuses on industry-academia type of projects to enable partners to link higher education, research and business. Students will be organized in international, multi-disciplinary virtual teams; this will already give a multi-cultural and cross-border character for student activities. The project results will be finalized and presented in the frame of events connected to blended short-term mobility of the students. \r\n\r\nThe focus of the research and development activities in the project is to upgrade the design education practice in the virtual environment will be on the design methodology (including ICT tools) and the implementation and application of the methodology into design education practice. To reach this goal three significant intellectual outputs are proposed: (1) a cutting-edge design methodology based on best practices and extensive research and development activities, (2) a complex resource of teaching/learning materials on the basis of NPD developments and updates and also the experiences from the student projects, and (3) a study on the application of NPD methods, challenges and impacts. The three major intellectual outputs will be propagated in three big scale multiplier events, one in each project year: a (1) public seminar, a (2) panel discussion, and an (3) open day, respectively. Those events will enable partners to invite experts for discussion, also press and media will provide high publicity. Project meetings (e.g. trans-national project meetings) will be scheduled around the same periods. Dissemination will not be restricted to multiplier events; research, development and also student project results and outcomes will be published periodically via a variety of mediums, while the main platform will be the project website. The scientific results will be presented in conferences or published as scientific journal papers.     \r\n\r\nIn three years we expect 120 design and engineering students, more than 12 professors and teachers, and 5-10 industrial professionals, and many external partners will bond professional ties - all in all around 150 people - for future collaboration in professional, academic and also private spheres of their lives.\r\n\r\nAlthough project is being carried out in virtual environment between the partners (which is already a great achievement of virtual mobility and the extensive use of ICT), the cross-border co-operation is enriched by student and staff mobility, which eventually will strengthen the quality of research and teaching quality and result in an increased learning experience. \r\n\r\nThe participating students will develop competences of 21st century engineers thus will be able to address challenges effectively when performing the NPD process in virtual world. They will be able to use methods and tools of the latest computer technologies and be able to achieve seamless human-technology interaction on the highest level. Participating university staff will acquire new knowledge on new technologies as well. The developed intellectual outputs will serve as a comprehensive resource of information for further research and design methodology development and improvements for several years after the project ends.

Leading up to our application Westum assessed the needs of our members and decided to build the project around three common and comprehensive areas for development: \r\n\r\n1) Relevant and flexible education  \r\n2) Integration and intercultural competence \r\n3) A strong connection between education and labour market  \r\n\r\nWe have also chosen to focus on those educational programmes and areas where we can find common denominators and where we see the greatest need for development within our consortium: \r\n\r\n1) Technology and sustainable development\r\n2) Health and Welfare \r\n3) Trade and Tourism  \r\n4) Information and communication technology as a pedagogical tool\r\n5) \u201dSwedish for immigrants\u201d education connected to a trade  \r\n6) Creative industries \r\n\r\nAll of our mobilities should be within one of these focus areas and adress at least one of our overarching areas for development. Westum is applying for a total of 229 mobilities where 112 are reserved for students. \r\n\r\nWestum is the coordinating partner and has the overall financial and administrative responsibility. Each adult education centre also has an Erasmus+ contact person who takes care of the contact with the participants in regards to preparatory activities, writing learning agreements etc., follow up of the mobilities and dissemination activities. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to adress the challenges faceing our region and result in a higher level of quality in the vocational education we provide. We also want to see a higher level of understanding for other cultures, staff members more open to modernisation and internationalisation and students developing their proffessional and personal characters abroad.", "http://info@elnpartner.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA102-034413_3"], [2016, "Career Management Skills - A New 'Literacy' for Sustainable Employment", "European Learning Network Ltd", 212929.0, 8, 9, "The development of guidance services for adults within the workforce is a topical concern. Dramatic changes in work structures and social organization have occurred that are placing demands on adults to rethink their careers on an on-going basis. Added to this, are current EU policies that emphasize the need for continuous education for future economic and social mobility in an increasingly competitive global environment.The ACUMEN project consortium are of the opinion that traditional career guidance, although still relevant and important as a school-based or institution-based service, is wholly unsuitable to meet the needs of adults already in the workforce and that there is a considerable gap in the market for freely available and easily accessible career management training resources to help adults take control of their own career trajectory. Career management is a continuous process that occurs throughout one's career and not just at discrete times. It may be helpful to think of career management as a philosophy and set of habits that enable adults achieve career goals and develop career resiliency. Career management skills are like 'labour market literacy'. Adults in the workforce who have developed the necessary skills should be able to assess where the labour market is going; consider new skill areas that are appropriate to their own strengths and preferences; develop a personalized learning plan and map-out their career pathway to sustainable and rewarding work based on an understanding of potential future skill needs. Successful career management is accomplished through regular habits of building relationships, engaging in career development conversations, updating your career development plan, and setting new goals as life and career needs change. Being proficient at career management also means possessing basic skills related to job searching and managing change in a resilient manner.The Career Management Skills Framework for Scotland, published in July 2012, describes career management skills set around 4 themes of Self; Strengths; Horizons; Networks. This framework will be the basis for the ACUMEN project and consortium partners will develop a complete suite of tools and resources that address each of the above themes and support adults within the workforce or those seeking employment to identify an appropriate career progression pathway. The ACUMEN project will develop these new resources for adult learners in the UK, Ireland, Cyprus, Italy, Austria, Czech Republic, Germany and Finland. It will be the first project to comprehensively address career management skills in a European context and will provide tools and resources that are localized to meet the needs of adult learners in each partner country. Furthermore, ACUMEN will provide free on-line access through the most popular on-line platforms to all tools and resources developed.

In the vision paper on open education 2030 J. M. Pawlowski stated that education is\r\n\r\ndistributed on a global market. Therefore, he argued it is crucial for Europe to engage a broad\r\n\r\ncommunity in cross-border collaboration to be successful in this field. In the vision paper \u00b4Open\r\n\r\nEducation 2030\u00b4 he comes up with six recommendations: (see Pawlowski, p. 78)\r\n\r\n1. to create an inventory of OER and OEP\r\n\r\n2. to integrate existing communities\r\n\r\n3. to integrate curricula\r\n\r\n4. to create regional networks\r\n\r\n5. to create global outreach programs\r\n\r\n6. to support open education policy building !\r\n\r\nOne aim is, that like in a huge store, online learning resources and open learning should be\r\n\r\nprovided all over Europe for free. Although it is a big chance to make education available for a\r\n\r\nbroad European group of interested learners, teachers, and trainers, there is no quality assurance\r\n\r\nof the courses, learning resources, and open measures.\r\n\r\nPedagogical material and education will be risky, if there are no standards to make sure that the\r\n\r\ncontent is correct and didactically well-prepared concerning the aims of the project, the didactical\r\n\r\nmethods, the structure, the level of difficulty, the provided information and tasks as well as\r\n\r\nconcerning the needs of the target groups. In former educational concepts experts were\r\n\r\nresponsible to design the curriculum, courses and the learning materials.\r\n\r\nNowadays, with unstructured and widely varying creation of content we have to create standards\r\n\r\nand guidelines to ensure these quality aspects and foster quality to fight social disadvantages,\r\n\r\nwhich can occur via wrong, unstructured or misleading information and knowledge. Especially\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged and marginalised groups in European society can suffer from misleading\r\n\r\ninformation due to the fact that they face lots of challenges. For example it might be possible that\r\n\r\nthey have fewer chances to identify problems and quality deficits of provided open educational\r\n\r\nresources themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is the point where EU-StORe comes into action. It is based on the recommendations of\r\n\r\nPawlowski and the EU and builds an inventory of online learning resources. Moreover, experts\r\n\r\nanalyse these materials and courses and create standards for open learning activities, which\r\n\r\nprovide a high quality. This leads to guidelines and standards that can be used (a) to create open\r\n\r\nlearning scenarios in the future and (b) to rate existing open learning activities and resources. To\r\n\r\nintegrate this information in the European learning community the standards are provided on an\r\n\r\nonline platform where the inventory is also accessible. This is a basis to foster curricular design and\r\n\r\nthe work of regional networks.

On long term, the effects of gadgets addiction are the dysfunction of movement abilities and biorhythm, a lower ability of self-control, the decrease of self-esteem, hyperactivity, exhaustion, loneliness, depression, anxiety, the decrease of focus ability, psychosis. At school level, missing classes, low school results and school dropout are alarming.Either it is a behavioral problem (according to the common point of view) or an illness (as many doctors and researchers in neurology state), opportunities for these youngsters or their families to receive help must be created.

In addition, functional decline in iAMD, as well as, specific risk factors for iAMD progression to late stage AMD need to be better characterized to inform and improve conduct of future iAMD CTs.\nAgainst this background, the major objective of MACUSTAR is to develop novel clinical endpoints for CTs with a regulatory and patient access intention in patients with iAMD. Additional objectives are to characterize visual impairment in iAMD and its progression, as well as, identify risk factors for progression.\nFor clinical endpoint development, functional, structural and patient-reported outcome measures will be assessed with regards to their measurement characteristics as well as their association with progression from iAMD to late stage AMD. \nAs central vision measured by best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at normal luminance is generally not affected in iAMD, the functional assessments will comprise novel functional vision tests conducted at low luminance, such as scotopic microperimetry and quantifiable dark adaptation, to establish clinical endpoints which reliably cover the functional impairment in iAMD. Also, the change in these functional outcomes preceding progression and during progression to late stage AMD will be assessed.\nFor all functional tests, we will assess functional changes meaningful to the participant \u2013 referred to as minimally important difference (MID). Combining functional with patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments allows us to capture MIDs for all functional tests as we will systematically assess whether a change in function translates into a patient-reported change in functioning ,as well as, patient preferences (i.e. utility).\nThe structural assessments will comprise multi-modal state-of-the-art high-resolution retinal imaging and subsequent grading in a central grading centre in Bonn (GRADE, UKB). This will allow for deep phenotyping and also accurate assessment of progression within iAMD and to late stage AMD. For iAMD, currently no optimized combination of these existing imaging technologies has been developed. We will provide this in MACUSTAR which will be the basis for an in-depth assessment of structural abnormalities and their progression in iAMD. Based on this, structural biomarkers potentially serving as surrogate endpoints in CTs will be validated. We will also explore novel approaches to structural biomarker extraction using automated image analysis.\nA patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) will be specifically developed and validated for iAMD as currently available vision-related PROM are focused on assessing the impact of visual loss, and almost a", 482067.0, 14046585.0, 6, 13, "MACUSTAR", null, null, null, "h2020_212554_997486115"], [1330560000000, 1467244800000, "European Consortium for the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy", "Moorfields Eye Hospital Nhs Foundation Trust", "Diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of blindness among working-age individuals in developed countries has been classically considered to be a microcirculatory disease of the retina.

Even though preventive measures are in place to reduce the incidence of stroke, the number of persons having a stroke in Europe is likely to increase from 1.1 million/year in 2000 to more than 1.5 million/year in 2025 because of the increasing ageing population.

Also, as mortality from first strokes has decreased recently, the number of people at risk for a secondary stroke has increased, with an associated increase in healthcare costs.

As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals.

In setting their own goals for the exchange the young people emphasize that they want to find out how the everyday life is in other countries, what do people do in their free time, what do they eat and what are the for example the salaries like. The young people also would like to find out about the lives of other young people in similar circumstances as themselves, i.e. young people in child protection services.

Most of the young people attending live in closed institutions, some of them live in foster homes and some of them are in after care. They have different kind of challenges in their lives. Some of them have faced domestic violence, substance misuse and mental health problems. Some of them have experienced violent and other crime as perpetrators and/or victims. Some of them also have learning difficulties, problems in controlling their behavior and anxiety in social situations. 49 young people will be attending the exchange.

It is a cooperation between two European organisations that work with and support young people belonging to this target group. \r\n\r\nThe theme is adressed via three sub-themes. These sub-themes are: Education, Employment and Justice.  Both organisation see that these are fundamental themes when supporting young people belonging to the target group of the project. Low levels of education or the lack of formal education altogether predict poor progress in the working life, problems with ones livelihood and also poor mental and physical health. If the young person does not get into the working life, the opportunities to support him/herself diminish and prolonged unemployment leads into all kind of problems.  If the young person gets in trouble with the law as a perpetrator of crimes, that predicts unemployment and a lack of prospects. Problems in these beforementioned themes can lead to a point where the young person feels as he/she is outside of the rest of the society and has no power over his/hers own affairs. These are complicated and interwoven affairs, where problems in one sector can lead to problems in other sectors too.\r\n\r\nBut. We can also turn this upside down (or downside up in this matter). If the young person completes an education that suits him/her, the possibilities of employment improve and the likelihood of committing crimes diminishes. Likewise, if a young person finds employment his/her financial situation improves and the possibilities of getting an education improve. If the young person can stop doing crime, the possibilities for getting an education or finding work improve dramatically. There are many possibilities in helping young people in vulnerable positions.\r\n\r\nThe project is a study visit that will be actualized from 28th to 30th of March (plus travel days). The action part of the project will last for three days and there will be twelve Finnish youth workers visiting the English partner.

It is essential for democratic and cohesive societies that all of the members of the society feel like they are a part of that society and that they also feel like they have genuine possibilities in influencing their own affairs.

Among the fundamental roles of telomeres is their role in meiosis, the process by which parental genomes are recombined and halved, allowing the generation of genetic diversity via sexual reproduction. As cells progress from mitotic to meiotic cycles, telomere functions change radically as all telomeres gather to a small region of the nuclear periphery near the centrosome to form the telomere bouquet . While this bouquet is widely conserved, the challenges of manipulating meiosis in most eukaryotes has made bouquet function a matter of speculation until recently. We utilize the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model to study telomeres, as this organism provides a powerful combination of genetic manipulability and striking conservation of chromosomal structure/function with human. Recently, we made the unexpected discovery that the bouquet controls the behavior of meiotic centrosomes and spindles. Furthermore, we find that the bouquet is required not only for proper spindle formation, but also for attachment of meiotic chromosomes to the spindle via their centromeres. Using molecular genetics, quantitative live analysis and biochemistry, we propose to define the mechanisms by which the gathered telomeres control spindle behavior.

TGFb is a multifunctional cytokine which, in addition to cancer is also implicated in developmental disorders, fibrosis and autoimmune diseases. TGFb signalling has been implicated in both tumour suppression and progression. Although TGFb inhibits inhibits growth of early carcinomas, later in tumourogenesis, it can induce an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting an invasive, metastatic tumour phenotype. TGFb signals through the activation of Smad proteins. After activation, Smads accumulate in the nucleus where they regulate transcription, either positively or negatively.

In the host lab, Salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) were identified as inhibitors of the Hippo pathway. SIKs belong to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family. AMPK family kinases are sensors of nutrient or energy status. Thus, SIKs might activate cell growth in conditions of optimal nutrient availability, thereby coupling developmental growth with nutritional status. In the proposed project I plan to investigate whether and how nutrient and energy levels regulate SIKs in context of Hippo signalling.

This virus sensing pathway mediated by RIG-I is crucial for successful host defence against negative stranded RNA viruses infection such as influenza virus. Influenza viruses are common pathogens responsible for recurrent seasonal respiratory illness and pose a serious threat to public health.

A role for ALC1 in DNA repair is supported by its rapid PAR-dependent recruitment to DNA breaks and by the sensitivity of ALC1-depleted cells to DNA damage agents.

Therefore, it is crucial to detect response as early as possible during treatment. Additionally, similar tumour types frequently have markedly different responses to the same therapy. Hodgkin lymphoma, for example, is one of the tumour types where a small group of patients fail to respond or respond poorly to treatment. The early evaluation of a specific treatment allows targeting effective therapy to responding patients while sparing the non-responders from expensive, toxic and unnecessary protocols. While the current method to assess treatment response is to measure tumour shrinkage by imaging, there may exist earlier and potentially more sensitive markers of treatment response based on tumour function. Prof Brindle\u2019s group has an established expertise in this field. This project aims to develop non-invasive and clinically applicable imaging methods for detecting the initial responses of tumors to therapy in a realistic preclinical, genetically engineered mouse model of lymphoma. In this model, tumors arise spontaneously, constituting a better model for the human disease than those used previously. We will treat these animals using current treatment protocols and will use the imaging methods that we develop to assess tumour response. These methods will include a targeted radio-labelled agent that detects dying tumour cells and a novel magnetic resonance method, based on nuclear spin hyperpolarization, in which treatment response is detected through specific changes in tumour metabolism.

To be able to diagnose and treat human cancer, it is essential that we understand these processes at the molecular level. Recent work in the host lab has established that the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Arkadia is an essential component of the branch of the TGF-beta/Smad pathway that is mediated via activated Smad3/Smad4 complexes. The lab has shown that Arkadia functions by targeting the transcriptional repressors, SnoN and Ski for degradation by the proteasome in response to TGF-beta signalling. Loss of Arkadia results in the stabilisation of SnoN and loss of Smad3/Smad4-dependent transcription, two events that are hall marks of some human tumours. Moreover, the host lab has identified an adenocarcinoma cell line, SEG-1, that expresses a non-functional truncated Arkadia protein due to a point mutation. Consequently these cells are deficient in TGF-beta-induced SnoN degradation. Taken together, these results suggest that Arkadia might be a novel tumour suppressor. The first aim of my proposal is to elucidate the mechanism whereby Arkadia mediates TGF-beta-induced SnoN degradation. For this I will take a biochemical and structural approach and will also use siRNA sceening to identify what other components are required.

AP-1 activity is regulated, in part, by the phosphorylation of its c-Jun component by the Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNKs).

Besides treating tumours by reversing the effects of oncoproteins through inhibition, another approach is to use therapies that target tumour-specific vulnerabilities caused by the oncogenic state. To investigate this possibility, an siRNA screen has been performed in order to identify new genes necessary for the RAS-driven oncogenic state. This approach has led to the identification of the matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) as a protein required for the survival of cells with an activated KRAS allele.

The main aim of this project is to study the mechanism underlying the dependency of cells with RAS activating mutations on MMP-7 expression. To determine this we will study four different pathways. MMP-7 can suppress apoptotic FasL/Fas pathway by cleaving FasL and reducing its efficacy in triggering Fas signals. Alternatively, MMP-7, by cleaving E-cadherin, can increase \u03b2-catenin-Wnt pathway, which is required by several tumour types. Moreover, MMP-7 proteolysis of IGFBP-3 plays a crucial role in regulating IGF-I bioavailability, thereby promoting cell survival. Finally, MMP-7 can process HB-EGF that will activate ErB4 signalling.

It has been proposed that the most quiescent HSC reside in the most hypoxic areas in the BM suggesting that low oxygen levels might play a key role in the maintenance of HSC. However the molecular mechanisms by which HSC respond to hypoxia have not been elucidated. Cells have developed a molecular mechanism for oxygen sensing. An important mediator is the transcriptional complex hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). At low oxygen levels, HIF is stabilized and regulates the transcription of crucial genes involved in cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Under normoxia, HIF has a low transcriptional activity. In addition, HIF has been reported to be upregulated in certain pathological conditions such as cancer where a high expression of HIF correlates with a poor prognosis.

There are many examples where such knowledge has been used to optimize the use of chemotherapeutic drugs, both to avoid toxicity and to maximize the therapeutic effect. The need for further research to investigate these drugs in children is acknowledged in the Priority List for Studies into Paediatric Medicinal Products, issued by the EMEA. Doxorubicin is on this list and is one of the most important drugs used in the treatment of childhood cancers. Several national groups have been successful in studying the pharmacology of drugs used in paediatric oncology. However, in order to recruit sufficient patient numbers for meaningful studies it is necessary to establish a wider group, bringing together the successful elements of established national organizations. The EPOC group combines leading pharmacologists, paediatric oncologists, regulatory organizations and a management structure which will successfully deliver data of appropriate quality on which to base future clinical use of this drug and to meet the demands of the EMEA priority list. Such data will form the basis of future applications for Paediatric Usage Marketing Authorization for doxorubicin. The overall aim of the consortium is to provide data that will guide the optimal use of this drug in the clinic, and also meet the regulatory requirements of the EMA.", 64875.0, 2205825.0, 5, 11, "EPOC", null, "http://www.cancerresearchuk.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-02/53984.jpg", "fp7_89715_999494888"], [1254355200000, 1348963200000, "Globally connecting single nucleotide variations to transcriptional regulation in vivo", "Cancer Research Uk", "Phenotype is a manifestation of a complicated relationship between the gene sequence that dictates the \u201cwhat\u201d of gene expression and regulatory elements that supply the crucial \u201cwhen, where, and how.\u201d The central components of gene regulation are transcription factors (TFs) \u2013 proteins that regulate transcription by binding to DNA regions adjacent to the gene. While TFs recognize specific DNA sequences, we do not fully understand the rules that allow regulators to distinguish among the millions of potentially bind-able sequences in the genome to select the tens of thousands chosen to be bound in vivo. Uncovering these rules is a key step in understanding the developmental and evolutionary processes that shape the observed phenotypic variation. Based on previous experiments we know that, despite the assumption that conserved function will correlate with conservation of TF binding, most TF binding events are species-specific (i.e. not evolutionarily conserved) and are driven by the underlying genetic sequence, not inter-species differences in nuclear environment. In this project, I will experimentally dissect the long-range sequence patterns that govern transcription factor binding. Aim 1: Scan TF binding in closely related species. I will use liver hepatocytes from closely related mouse strains to map the TF binding sites using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) combined with ultra highthroughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq). Aim 2: Identify species-specific TF binding events that do not follow simple binding rules. Find the long-range sequence changes associated with these events. Aim 3: Confirm our findings in related species and formulate rules underlying TF binding.
