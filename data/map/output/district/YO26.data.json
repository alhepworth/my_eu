The 24 month project will begin with a start-up seminar in London hosted at the National Centre for Circus Arts welcoming one participant from each partner.

An 18 month phase of job shadows will be offered by all partners in order to offer a diverse range of opportunities for staff skills, knowledge and competence development in the field. In parallel to these activities the other arm of the project will be researching circus education provision, creating a catalogue of current practice and researching the public (and stakeholders) views about circus education.

After the festivals volunteers will be involved in the salvaging of good quality camping equipment and food that has been abandoned by other festival-goers. The food is donated immediately to charities working with the homeless and those effected by poverty, and the equipment is dried, sorted, cleaned and redistributed to community groups, charities and local organisations in the days following the festival. \r\nOne of the main themes for the project is environmental awareness and participants will be surrounded by the green message both\r\nduring the activities and at the training that they will receive at the start of the project.
