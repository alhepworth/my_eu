The rationale behind the project is that we live in a rapidly changing world and schools need to respond to this by delivering engaging lessons that promote the use of new technologies and equip our students with the skills they need to succeed beyond the classroom. In addition we will be focusing on the need to develop professionally as staff and to share our knowledge and expertise with one another in order to improve students\u2019 learning.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to achieve these objectives through a range of activities. These include:\r\n- Using new technologies such as Skype to deliver live lessons between partner countries\r\n- Teaching core skills such as Maths using a foreign language with live lessons shared between countries and allowing students to plan and teach Maths lessons in another language\r\n- Developing opportunities for SEN students to access Modern Foreign Languages.  SEN students in partner schools will devise a project involving MFL to be delivered to local primary schools and will share their experiences through the forum of video conferencing\r\n- Students working collaboratively to create a list of criteria for an effective MFL lesson and then devising and teaching a lesson based on these criteria.\r\n\r\nFive partner schools from United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and Finland will be involved in the project, each with their own area of expertise and, although the project is very much a shared enterprise, each school will have responsibility for overseeing a specific project activity.\r\n\r\nAll work completed during the project will be shared on an eTwinning Twin Space, the project website and in the termly project newsletter.  We are aware of the need to celebrate our successes but these tools also represent an important forum for discussion and feedback and will be vital for monitoring the impact of the project.  \r\n\r\nWe aim to have several tangible outcomes during the course of the project as well as longer term benefits.  By the end of the project we will have developed a bank of teaching and learning resources across a range of subjects and these will be ready for future use within our schools and openly available for all other schools via our website.  We will have given staff in a range of subjects the opportunity to network with their peers across Europe and enhance their professional development through the sharing of good practice.  In addition to this we will be encouraging students to develop key skills such as collaborative learning, critical thinking, team teaching and giving them the opportunity to learn core subjects in a different, more creative way. \r\n\r\nFor full details of our project, please see the Project Overview  which is attached to the form.", "http://www.ounsdale.co.uk", "Ounsdale High School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013540_coordinator"], [2015, "Nya Hammarskolan", "Ounsdale High School", 12333.0, 7, 7, "International development plan for Hammarskolan 2015-2017\r\n\r\nThe activities are linked to:\r\n\r\nThe educational goals of the EU year 2020:\r\nThe percentage of under-achieving 15-years-old in reading, mathematics and natural science should be below 15%.\r\n90% of all young people should complete their secondary education.\r\nGoals of Erasmus+\r\nStrengthen the international dimension.\r\nImprove language teaching and language learning.\r\nContribute to a higher quality and more internationalisation within the educational system.\r\nThe goals of Sweden:\r\nPrevent early school-leaving.\r\nStrengthen basic skills\r\nThe goals of Hammarskolan:\r\nWe want to reach higher effectiveness and promote school attainment in all subjects and in this way prevent early school leaving. We want to increase the social protection as well as the chance of working effictively for all students in the classroom. Inclusion is a key word.  We want to increase the international cooperation and work with different schools in Europe. Our goal is to strengthen our language teaching by this cooperation.\r\n\r\n Needs: \r\nSurahammar is a small mill town in the county of V\u00e4stmanland. The community of Surahammar has aproximately 10000 inhabitants. The population has, until recently,  been rather homogenous , with inhabitants of Swedish or Finnish origin. In recent years the population has become more and more heterogenous, because of all refugees.\r\nIn many homes the parents are not used to studies and it can be hard to motivate our students to study at home. We need to observe schools that have succeeded in motivating their students to reach high results in spite the lack of support from the parents. We also want to influence our students\u2019 attitudes, so that it will be something positive to study and reach high results. The PISA results in Sweden are far below average and we would like to visit schools in countries that have succeeded far better than we have.  In this way we would like to learn from those countries and in the long run be able to avoid that students stay at home in stead of going to school . We think that this could prevent early school-leaving.\r\nWe also need to learn how to motivate our students to study languages and how they can succeed in their language studies. Our language teachers need contacts in the countries where they speak the languages that we teach, to be able to give our students the possibility to communicate for real. Furthermore our language teachers need to develop their own languages to be able to stay in touch with new influences in the languages that they teach.\r\n\r\nAims\r\nOur aims are to create a safe and friendly atmosphere for studies, where it would be permitted to succeed at school. We would like to include all the students in the classroom and thereby reach higher results in all subjects.\r\nWe would also like to reach higher results in foreign languages, through the education of our language teachers. Furthermore we want to broathen our teachers\u2019  and our students\u2019 horizons by enlightening  them about daily life in schools in other countries.\r\nAnother aim  is to start an ongoing cooperation with a number of schools in Europe, to be able to see how they work with these matters in other countries in Europe.\r\n\r\nResults and effects:\r\nBetter results in all subjects\r\nA safe and friendly atmosphere for studying, where all students are included.\r\nBetter results in foreign langauges.\r\nGet all students to school and prevent early school-leaving.\r\nA better understanding for the world around us.\r\nA continous cooperation with schools in Europe.\r\nA bigger European dimension in teaching, get Europe into the classroom.\r\n\r\nActivities 2015-2017\r\nJob-shadowing: 3 special needs teachers will study inclusion and how to create a quiet and friendly atmoshere in the classroom, in Finland, Poland and Germany. A maths/natural science teacher will study methods of the Maths teaching in the Netherlands. A Swedish/social studies teacher will study how to reach high reading comprehension, in Finland. Three language teachers will study how to teach languages in France, Germany and England. Our English teachers will take part in a course in Great Britain: \u201c Language, Life and Culture in the UK today\u201d\r\n\r\nDissimination:\r\nOur staff will update our progress on our internal website Schoolsoft, where they will write about their experiences so that the rest of the staff, our students and the students\u2019 parents can be informed about their accomplishments. The teachers who have taken part in job-shadowing will talk about their observations during our staff meetings, so that everybody can benefit from their experiences and so that we can make a plan for the future for our school. Through meetings between teachers for different ages, the experiences will be shared. The education of the language teachers will inspire the students to continue their language studies and to get longterm contacts in the countries where the languages they study are spoken.

On the one hand, it will allow the students to carry out workshops and practical activities in similar training schools to their own, interacting with students and staff. On the other hand, the students will have the opportunity to do their internships in companies, so they can immerse themselves in the business reality of the country and in the teams of the companies.
