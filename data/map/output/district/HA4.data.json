Both cities as well as private service providers can build novel applications and services on top of this platform; the platform thus becomes an economically valuable driver for Smart City Innovation.\nThe main goal of this project is to develop such a City Platform as a Service (CPaaS) that can be federated to support regional or even global applications, and that forms the basis for a smart city data infrastructure. Technical challenges that need to be addressed include data provenance, data quality, adaptive privacy levels, policies and adaptive processes for distributing and deploying processing intelligence to the cloud or to the edge. Other important aspects include data governance, data management and the empowerment of the citizen to control access and sharing of data about her using a MyData approach. \nIn addition to the development of the platform, several use cases in the domains of event and transport management, water management, and health emergency services will be implemented and validated with cities in Europe and Japan.

Small-cells promise to provide the required data rates through an increased spatial utilisation of the spectrum.<br/>Problem statement. Due to strong inter-cell interference, small-cell deployments will require a high degree of coordination as offered by centralised processing. Furthermore, heterogeneous backhaul solutions will be used to connect small-cells and core network. So far, access and backhaul are individually designed and therefore not optimised. In order to support centralised processing and a heterogeneous backhaul, challenges on access and backhaul must be simultaneously tackled.<br/>Approach. iJOIN introduces the novel concept RAN-as-a-Service (RANaaS), where RAN functionality is flexibly centralised through an open IT platform based on a cloud infrastructure. iJOIN aims for a joint design and optimisation of access and backhaul, operation and management algorithms, and architectural elements, integrating small-cells, heterogeneous backhaul, and centralised processing.

The GeoNet project will significantly contribute to this goal by implementing a reference implementation of a geographic addressing and routing protocol with support for IPv6 to be used to deliver safety messages between cars but also between cars and the roadside infrastructure within a designated destination area.<br/>While the CAR 2 CAR Communication Consortium has invested significant effort into the specification of a car-to-car communications mechanism suitable for safety applications, its mandate does not extend beyond defining a specification. At the same time, ongoing projects like SafeSpot would need an actual implementation to rely on whereas other such as CVIS are developing a communication architecture relying on the maintenance of a constant access to the Internet over IPv6. <br/>GeoNet shall bring the basic results from the work of the CAR 2 CAR Communication Consortium to the next step, by further improving these specifications and creating a baseline software implementation interfacing with IPv6. The goal of GeoNet is thus to implement and formally test a networking mechanism as a standalone software module which can be incorporated into Cooperative Systems. This implementation shall enable transparent IP connectivity between a vehicle and the infrastructure, even in cases when delivery must be hopped over several vehicles or cached along the way.
