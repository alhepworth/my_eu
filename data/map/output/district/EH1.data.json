So, most of these organizations and companies have the exeperience in welcoming foreign students.During this training course time,  students are going to improve their English or Spanish level, to put into practise their professional skills and  get a better knowledge of the world of work in a foreign country. This project is a very  rewarding experience for them as young adults ready to get a fresh start on the labour market :  For some of them its their first time abroad , meeting different people in everyday life situations different from their daily lives .The \"Europass\" portfolio and the \"Europro\" certificate is a validation exam to assess their skills after this stay.

Our intention to expand and deepen existing contact with educational institutions in Turkey has been somewhat shaken by ongoing political developments in the country. Subject to unfolding events in the country, a vocational teaching personnel visit - to explore further cooperation opportunities with partners in Turkey - should take place in early 2017.

With appropriate knowledge and skills they can contribute an important part to qualitative changes on different levels of nightlife. On the other hand, nightlife, parties and music festivals are an important part of life of young people in general. It's a setting where they can socialize and grow their social capital, relax, get new experiences and also be creative and express themselves in different ways (creating music, performing visual arts, dancing, ...).

We see this risks also as an opportunity for young people to act responsibly in order to reduce risks, encourage them to be critical to unsafe party environments and develop solidarity and helping skills towards other young people in trouble. Intervention in nightlife settings is also a field where different profession profiles meet and share their expertise and knowledge (for example medicine staff, social workers and pedagogues, youth workers, chemists, psychologists), therefore there are a lot of opportunities for peer workers to get some insight in their work and non-formal knowledge and experience on those topics, which can be useful for their future personal and professional development.

The main aim of the MA programme is to prepare the apprentice for life as a professional player but also to provide additional qualifications so that a smooth transfer onto a second career pathway can be made if necessary i.e. professional contract is not forthcoming or a serious injury occurs.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate evaluation of success will be an increase in employability of participants achieving success as a professional footballer or gaining employment in a secondary career pathway. These are medium/long term surveys, which will be undertaken by Hearts FC following completion of mobility. Contact will be maintained with participants on completion of their apprenticeship and employment status, job description, salary levels and contract status (permanent or fixed term) will be recorded and will be used in the dissemination process. The data collected will be disseminated freely.\r\n\r\nAside from our own internal evaluation processes, Hearts FC will participate in a Sector Skills Alliance (SSA) involving other UK professional football clubs who are participating in Erasmus+ VET Learner mobility. This SSA will seek to improve the content and delivery of vocational training programmes and training methodologies in the UK by sharing European best practice and incorporating these initiatives within the vocational education framework.\r\n\r\nKey project objectives involve the enhanced acquisition of key coaching innovations which will result in improved player performance and enhanced skills levels for the participant during mobility.

The specific reasons for the decline in this important species are as yet unknown, however, climate change is likely to be an important factor. In some rivers in the southern part of the salmons range, wild salmon now face extinction. This is in spite of unprecedented management measures to halt this decline. Arguably the greatest challenge in salmon conservation is to gain insight into the spatial and ecological use of the marine environment by different regional and river stocks, which are known to show variation in marine growth, condition, and survival. Salmon populations may migrate to different marine zones, whose environmental conditions may vary. To date it has been impossible to sample and identify the origin of sufficient numbers of wild salmon at sea to enable this vital question to be addressed. SALSEA-Merge will provide the basis for advancing our understanding of oceanic-scale, ecological and ecosystem processes. Such knowledge is fundamental to the future sustainable management of this key marine species. Through a partnership of 9 European nations the programme will deliver innovation in the areas of: genetic stock identification techniques, new genetic marker development, fine scale estimates of growth on a weekly and monthly basis, the use of novel high seas pelagic trawling technology and individual stock linked estimates of food and feeding patterns. In addition, the use of the three-dimensional Regional Ocean Modelling System, merging hydrography, oceanographic, genetic and ecological data, will deliver novel stock specific migration and distribution models.

They will learn about the language, the food, the location, the customs, the currency, tourist attractions, etc. In addition, they will also be prepared on a personal level and will be taught many life lessons: communicating effectively, living together, resolving conflicts, planning, organising, improving their independence by living and traveling in a foreign city and in a foreign language which in turn will strengthen their social skills. This will enable them to achieve many curriculum specific goals (giving a presentation, researching information, self-evaluation, peer-evaluation, etc.) as well as more overarching educational goals. Concrete examples include lessons in communicating (British small talk), budgeting, resolving conflicts. They will visit the British shop in Everberg and take a cooking workshop. They will research specific information about their destination, as well as suitable accommodation and transport options. They will complete a Europass CV and Language Passport. They will make a short video highlighting their motivation for the project and they will clarify this in an interview in front of a jury of teachers and external experts. They will write a weekly blog detailing their most interesting experiences. They will write an assessment of their internship experience and will present their experiences to the students who will come after them.\r\n\r\nThe highlight of the school year is the two week continuous internship in either London or Edinburgh where students will apply and strengthen the knowledge and attitudes acquired at school and where they will execute the tasks of an administrative assistant in an international context: making telephone calls, welcoming visitors, classifying documents, handling correspondence, conducting sales consultations.\r\n\r\nThis will enable them to demonstrate a number of general and professional attitudes, such as punctuality, orderliness, politeness, adhering to dress code, self-reliance, self-confidence, motivation, pushing their boundaries. They will practise the language and experience the culture of their destination in diverse ways. They will become acquainted with company culture in the United Kingdom and will learn to execute the daily tasks at their internship in ways which refine and extend their job specific competencies. In this way they will greatly improve their future job opportunities, they will get a taste for moving around Europe, and they will become aware of their European citizenship.

Daily we hear of \u2018skills gaps\u2019 - the mismatch between skills supply and demand in the labour market. The problem cannot be solved by the education alone, but vocational education is one of the key activities tasked with supplying an answer.\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM\r\nVET schools simultaneously have to meet two opposing requirements: to remain true to tradition, delivering stable, tested knowledge approved by relevant parties in society and the economy; and to equip students with set of skills and competences relevant to newly emerging demands.\r\nDespite great efforts by national and European policy makers to drive VET schools into \u2018rethinking\u2019 their curricula and teaching methods, changes have been slow to keep up with labour market requirements. In most European countries VET qualifications are based on standard curricula that precisely define what is taught, leaving little freedom for teachers and schools to train for just-in-time labour market demands. Most systems also have lengthy and complex accreditation procedures, so the approval of a new curriculum - or even the modification of an existing one \u2013 can take a long time.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nThe experience and best practices of the consortium will be captured in two main products.\r\n1. The Reacti-VET Training Package for Teachers will be available online in 4 languages. it will: \r\n\u2022 be accredited\r\n\u2022 contribute to the professional development of teachers \r\n\u2022 help teachers to transform traditional teaching using creative and innovative contemporary methods\r\n\u2022 develop teacher competences to embrace the potential of OERs in the rapid development of short, up-skilling training\r\n\u2022 train teachers in effective collaboration, both inside and outside the school\r\n\u2022 support students to take more responsibility for their own learning performance and processes\r\n\u2022 develop 21st century skills and key competences within students.\r\n\r\n2 Reacti-VET Upskilling Training \u2013 which will be tested within the IT sector, but the generic methodology will be applicable to other fields of vocational education.  \r\nThe impact will be: \r\n\u2022 to help reduce skills-gaps;\r\n\u2022 to better position students in the labor market; \r\n\u2022 to increase SME access to a large, skilled workforce able to respond to new and fast changing demands in a competitive job market.", "http://www.capdm.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-HU01-KA202-047816_2"], [2015, "Flip IT! \u2013 Flipped Classroom in the European Vocational Education", "Opus Learning Ltd", 246261.0, 5, 10, "One of the burning issues of today is how to improve the quality of learning/teaching in schools. Thousands of studies and scientific research has tried to reveal the best methods, and to formulate usable advice in order to transfer theoretical conclusions into the daily practice of our schools. A particular focus has been placed on European vocational educational (VET) schools and training centres as the current economical crisis is forcing them to respond to identified demands: \u201cincreasing attractiveness, embedding stronger work based learning, enhancing labour market relevance, developing stronger career and education guidance, implementing teachers and trainers professional development.\r\n\r\nRecent educational studies often draw the conclusion that \u201cthe full potential of ICT is not being realised in formal education settings and that only a few innovative projects manage to survive beyond the early adopter stage and become fully embedded in educational practice.\u201d (S. Bocconi, P. G. Kampylis, Y. Punie, 2012).\r\n\r\nTeachers are increasingly expected to be adept at a variety of technology-based and other approaches for content delivery, learner support, and assessment; to collaborate with other teachers both inside and outside their schools; to routinely use digital strategies in their work with students; to act as guides and mentors to promote student-centered learning. Students, along with their families, add to these expectations through their own use of technology to socialize, organize, and informally learn on a daily basis.\u201d (The Horizon Report Europe:  Schools Edition examines trends, challenges, and technologies for their potential impact on and use in teaching, learning, and creative inquiry, NMC, 2014). \r\n\r\nThe long term aim of the project is to improve the quality of the vocational education and to engage a movement towards the work-based, collaborative and problem-oriented learning/teaching by utilizing the pedagogical potential of ICT tools by integrating the \u201cflipped classroom\u201d methodology into the pedagogical practice of the VET schools and training centers in the partner countries.\r\n\r\nThe target group of the project are the teachers, trainers and students of the European vocational schools.\r\n\r\nWe are convinced that \u201cflipping the classroom\u201d would be especially beneficial for the vocational education, where the schools are facing the challenge to meet the needs of the ever-changing labor market. The speed of technological evolution makes almost impossible to provide the vocational schools with traditional textbooks in time. Preparing learning materials for the students, the teachers have to take more and more into consideration the huge amount of information available on the Internet. How they can/should influence the students\u2019 attitude of \u201cbeing always connected\u201d towards using the Internet for learning? How will be possible to exceed the limits of a Power Point presentation in the classroom? What kind of IT tools are the most effective for supporting the pedagogical work? \u201cFlip IT!\u201d consortium would like to promote the VET teachers in their challengesI\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the long term aims, we will utilize the results on FC methodology of the HE partners of the consortium, and transfer these results into the parctice of the vocational education. During the 36 months long project period we intend to add new components to the transferred methodology as well, like an FC curriculum and course for the teachers.  As a consequence while we defined Hungary and Spain as target countries, the university partners can become the beneficiaries of the results as well, as they will be able to utilize the outcomes for further development of their present achievements. \r\n\r\nThe main outcomes of the project are:\r\nFlipped Classroom Pedagogical Model and Practice for VET\r\nFlipped Classroom Curriculum for VET teachers\r\nOnline Learning Content for Flipped Classroom Curricuum\r\nOnline Community to for VET teacher and trainers for sharing FC\r\nFlipped Classroom Methodology in the Vocational Education\r\nFlipped Classroom Textbook for VET teachers\r\n\r\nIn the consortium 10 partners will collaborate from five European countries; from Hungary, Italy, Spain, Ireland and from the UK - representing all type of organisations working in the VET sector.

As the number of migrants entering Europe rapidly increases, their cultural integration and inclusion in European societies becomes a priority. Bearing in mind that integration is a two-way process, the progressively increasing multicultural character of EU societies demonstrates the need to introduce intercultural education programmes that recognise and effectively support diversity, promote mutual acceptance and respect, while combatting racism and xenophobia. \r\nAgainst this backdrop, supporting the efforts of EU member states to help integrate migrants and refugees into Europe's education systems and ensure their skills development is an urgent and demanding task. Its success is dependent on the educators and teachers, who should be appropriately trained to have a deep understanding of basic concepts of culture and intercultural communication, as well as the historic and contemporary international context. This would enable them to develop an inclusive curriculum and integrate intercultural citizenship education so that they can foster interculturalism and avoid archaic educational practices that cultivate monoculture, othering and stigmatisation. \r\nTo achieve this, as well as the wider challenge of migrants' cultural integration, this project will design a programme for adult educators working with migrants. For this purpose, the project partners will: a) investigate the status quo regarding migrant integration policies, existing programmes and training structures on intercultural training for migrants and educators in partner countries; b) compare and analyse the results of this investigation to develop a needs analysis for intercultural education of trainers; c) develop an internationally competitive modularised training curriculum with qualification standards specialised for Adult Education (EQF Level 5); d) produce a handbook for trainers, which will include learning outcomes, a theoretical framework of basic concepts and the training package itself which will include practical exercises and, where possible, case studies. \r\nAt the beginning of the project , a database of stakeholders in every partner's country will be created which will include actors related to the project aim; experts in AE and intercultural education, migration centres providing training, other interested parties etc.\r\nThe main activities of this project are:\r\nResearch on intercultural education; Partners will collect data on existing training programmes designed for migrants and their cultural integration and will point out the needs for updates or the development of new material.\r\nCurriculum development; A Curriculum on intercultural education and training for Adult educators will be developed based on O1 and O2 results.\r\nDevelopment of training materials; The objective is to elaborate a set of sample training materials organised in modules and divided into topics\r\nDevelopment of a MOOC, where the training materials will be uploaded and adapted.\r\nImplementation of a JSTE; Through the JSTE the partners will test the formerly developed curriculum and training materials, will provide feedback on activities and make eventual changes before the final output.\r\nA Training guide and a course syllabus with final material and useful information and tips will be made available to Adult educators and all interested parties.\r\nMonitoring, evaluation and dissemination; Valorisation activities aim to ensure the widest possible dissemination of objectives, the work and outputs of the project.\r\n\r\nDuring the project, the partners will raise awareness of the use of intercultural training techniques in adult education. The project will therefore have a direct impact not only on adult educators and staff involved in the project, but also on the wider target group of adult educators and newly arrived migrants receiving intercultural training focused on the host countries. The integrative nature and the professional relevance of the materials and methodology will also have an impact on the motivation of newly arrived migrants to learn about the culture, customs and everyday life in their host countries.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of the project in all its forms will be disseminated and exploited with a view to maximizing their value and impact. The feedback provided by end-users will ensure that the results will be relevant to target groups and will therefore encourage their use. The developed training programme  can be easily adapted and tailored to changing needs. The curriculum can also be used as a teaching and learning aid for other institutions as it focuses on certain topics which can be re\u2212organized according to the needs of different contexts.

Single parents often experience in-work poverty. The necessity to balance employment with parenting and the covert discrimination they face at the labour market leads single parents to seek less qualified, lower paying precarious employment. What is needed are easily accessible learning tools for both employers (HR specialists, small business owners etc.) and single parents to help them to work more efficiently together and help achieve the considerable potential of single parents. Objectives of project:This project aims to support single parents to stay employed and to engage with employers and HR specialists to achieve this. Experiences of APERIO and W&L show that employers welcome activities that contribute to employee satisfaction, and thus to increased profit. This project will significantly contribute to sustainable employment of single parents, reduce their risk of poverty, and prevent further social risks to single parents and their children.  The project will also explore ways to involve parents and employers more intensively in online learning, and maximise their long-term learning outcomes.Description of activities:-Two outputs focus on both single parents and employers:O1. Disadvantaged single parents in employment who struggle to keep and progress in their jobO2. HR specialists and small business owners who want to use the professional potential of single parents and avoid fluctuation of experienced staff-Our project will develop practical educational modules both for single parents and HR specialists from a variety of organizations.-These modules will combine experience and best training practices from all partners. We will achieve a wider accessibility of the modules by making them available online.Number and profile of participants: The project will benefit approximately 2240 people in total; 50 persons employed at all partners, 10 + 8 persons attending the dissemination event, at least 100 persons (stakeholders) from each country who will watch the dissemination event materials,  50 persons at piloting stage of both programmes in each country,100 single parents from each country who have participated in the single parents programme in the first 12 months after the programme launch,  25 HR experts/small business owners who have participated in the programme for employers in each country in the first 12 months after the programme launch, 200 stakeholders (NGOs, civil servants, social workers, charities etc.) who will have heard about the project and its activities during the project and 12 months after its conclusion, will understand more deeply the situation and needs of single parents, and have access to good practices in helping them stay in employment.Methodology to be used in carrying out the project:-Application of participatory, blended and evidence based methodology. -Website development using blended learning methodologies to facilitate life-long learning and support professionals\u2019 development. -Evidence-based design applied in Preparation phase and partners\u2019 experiences ensure a systematic and empirically informed approach.- Qualitative and quantitative surveys of participants\u2019 experience- Collaboration in transnational teams to ensure intercultural relevance and experience transfer- Mutual experience exchange and evaluationResults and impact:Parents will:- gain free access to learning modules built on tested methodologies, so far mostly available only in \"classroom\" learning modules;- learn new ways to enter and stay in the labour market;- plan a career path and continued progression; - know the key components to finding and keeping meaningful, balanced and sustainable employment and understanding supports - increase crucial intra-personal and inter-personal skills associated with personal empowerment and professional success   Employers will:- learn to support single parents in the workplace- identify positive aspects to having single parent employees - gain knowledge on diversity in families in society and create intercultural sensitivity, so as to work with, and employ, all parents and families without judgment.Longer term impact and benefits:-Single parents: prevention of or progress out of social exclusion, poverty and exhaustion-Improved employment rates for single parents and better collaboration between single parents and employers.-Employers and other stakeholders: increased awareness and ability to serve and work with diverse families -Society as a whole: increased awareness of needs of single parents and fragile families via dissemination activities", "http://www.opfs.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IE01-KA204-016893_2"]]}}, "3QB": {"cordis": {"data": [[1262304000000, 1338422400000, "An Innovative, Ultra Low Cost, High Performance,  Monolithic Millimeter Wave Imager Module to Increase the Safety of European Citizens", "MMIC Solutions Ltd", "Protecting its citizens from terrorism remains a high priority for the EC. Current SOA security procedures for air travel have significantly improved airport security. The need is now to protect the softer, unprotected areas such as mass transportation systems and hubs which are being targeted with devastating effect (London, Madrid). They are largely unprotected since current security systems are too expensive and too slow. Therefore, there is an urgent need for innovative new security screening technology that can provide a low cost, rapid \u2018walk-by\u2019 screening at normal flow rates. Whilst millimetre-wave (mm-wave) technology is the leading technology, cost is a barrier. The critical part of mm-wave systems is the detector module, at a cost of \u20ac1125 per pixel, the imager module accounts for 60% of the overall system cost. At present this high cost is due to the cost of semiconductor material and the cost of assembly and tuning to overcome resonance effects.\n\nThis proposal will develop an innovative solution to reduce mm-wave module cost down to \u20ac150. This is clearly ambitious, but with the innovations below we are confident we can be successful:\n\na) Integrating the LNA & detector stages onto a single semiconductor wafer\nb) Developing GaAs semiconductor wafer using mHEMPT epi-layer instead of pHEMT\nc) Integrating a novel antenna and waveguide into a low cost, injection moulded liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrate.\n\nThis is an extremely challenging project requiring significant scientific knowledge generation and technology development.
