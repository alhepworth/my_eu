Our school has the task and mission to develop an intercultural teaching practice supported by innovative methods and entrepreneurship to achieve a more entrepreneurial learning for the benefits of our students. For some years now, we have run a number of international projects to develop our school and the training provided, and our experience is that it is a successful means to foster an international spirit to help make young people mobile and apt to actively seek a career or education in other European countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method to obtain the targets is to enable our teachers and students to develop their own learning as well as the learning of others through a greater intercultural understanding, improved lingusitic skills, stonger professional skills and an enhanced self-esteem. The international perspective provided by the project makes it possible to view oneself from a European perspective, which helps the individual to (also) take the step to work and live elsewhere in Europe. The participant teachers learn new methods to develop their teaching to make a greater number of students succeed in their learning. Thereby, our teaching staff help increase the students'  employability all over Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe add to our vocational students' opportunities by making them more attractive in their future work fields by making them develop entrepreneurial skills, their professional special skills as well as their cultural know-how and understanding.  We do this by developing the entrepreneurial learning by  focusing on ICT pedagogy, collaboration between education and enterprises (big and small in various fields of work), increased student influence and tutoring/mentoring as well as by by adding to their linguistic competences and sense of democarcy as a result of inclusion in an international environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this stage, sixteen of our teachers in vocational training will perform work shadowing and study how teachers in carefully chosen schools work with a strong development in the chosen fields of interest.  Our partners for work shadowing are Newton Abbot College, Tavistock College and South Devon College. In addition, a great number of our vocational students, 146 to be precise, will do work experience with numerous organisations and enterprises in England, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Poland. All organisations to be receiving partners have had vocational students from us in previous projects, which ensures that they will take on our students in the very best way and provide them with supervision, relevant work as well as plan, carry our and assess to what degree the learning outcomes have been reached in the time of work placement. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants will be selected upon submission of an application, and they will then prepare for the time abroad linguistically and culturally. We will use the chart provided by the commission and also create learning agreements an formulate learning outcomes for all participants, i.e. both students and teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bromangymnasiet project group - a principal, an administrator and a coordinator - organises all activities that relate to the work shadowing and work experience. The group is in charge of and responsible for selecting participants, communicating with partners, establishing various agreements/contracts, practicalities such as bookings, economy, evaluation and dissemination of the project results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy partaking in this project, we expect of participating teachers to develop their teaching practice to a more entrepreneurially featured kind that supplies the students with tools to succeed in their field of training. We know from experience that vocational work experience abroad generates increased vocational competences, a greater intercultural understanding, improved lingusitic skills and an enhanced self-esteem, which also makes them dare take the step onto the European field of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeachers who participate in work shadowing will share their experiences and learning outcomes with colleagues upon their return, which will further the progression in the eduactional development. The students who engage in work placements elsewhere in Europe will inspire other students to do the same in the future.

As these systems go in to commercial production and service, it is important to consider and develop inspection and condition monitoring techniques and systems. Condition monitoring of such systems could be used to greatly reduce the risk of failures and therefore minimise loss of power generation. If the condition of these structures is known, repairs could be scheduled for periods of low demand, rather than reacting to failures. Remote condition monitoring would reduce or eliminate the need for inspection personnel to travel out to these installations, which would be located in regions of fast-moving tidal flow and may be completely submerged, making access hazardous. By considering monitoring at this stage in development, it may be possible to influence the design of these systems in order to aid the implementation of condition monitoring. The most well-established technique for tidal energy is the use of tidal barrages, however, there are still only three operating commercially in the world. Tidal barrages are located in tidal inlets or estuaries and the tidal flow moves backwards and forwards through turbines. An alternative and more novel technique is the use of marine turbines that are located on the sea bed that generate power from tidal flows. These turbines are submerged, with rotating blades similar in appearance to those of a wind turbine. A major advantage of these is that they can be located out of sight and deep enough not to obstruct shipping channels. Techniques for condition monitoring of these marine turbines will be developed by combining acoustic emission (AE) monitoring and long-range ultrasonic testing (LRUT).

The collaborative nature of this project has allowed a very strong team of partners to be assembled that has the necessary expertise to design, build, test and optimise the full scale demonstrator. The pre-production prototype to be demonstrated uses oscillating hydrofoils; this technology is currently being tested by Pulse Tidal in a scaled marine trial in the UK. Oscillating hydrofoils have been proposed previously for exploiting tidal currents. Pulse Tidal, the holder of the IPR, has an improved technical approach and a refined strategy, which exploits the benefits of oscillating foils over wind turbine style axial flow rotors. Modelling has shown that high efficiencies can be achieved from a hydrofoil oscillating at certain frequencies. Scaled model testing by Pulse Tidal has confirmed that a phased pair of hydrofoils sweeping the same cross section of flow improves power capture efficiency to a level comparable with axial flow systems. The hydrofoil approach allows power to be captured with a wide, shallow swept area. In a given depth oscillating foil systems can be up to four times more powerful than single axial flow rotors. In reality almost all sites are too shallow for multi-megawatt axial flow rotors. By offering much larger unit capacities Pulse will have a unique strategic and economic advantage over other technologies.

These complications impose an immense burden on the quality of life of the patients and account for more than 10% of health care costs in Europe.

They are therefore  largely unprepared to face the increasing demands for health services arising from the expansion of an older population with specific  medical needs related to multiple chronic disorders. As a consequence, the medical conditions of a large and growing segment of the older European population are not efficiently managed by the available healthcare services. Among these conditions, the geriatric syndrome of frailty has emerged as a significant public health priority. It is defined as a multidimensional condition characterised by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors. Such extreme vulnerability exposes the older individual to an increased risk of morbidity, disability, inappropriate healthcare use, institutionalization, poor quality of life, and death. Early detection and prevention of frailty are thus crucial to impede its progression and the development of its detrimental clinical consequences, while ensuring sustainability of healthcare systems of the Member States. Unfortunately, to date, no healthcare programs or pharmacological treatments are available for frail older people. This is largely due to the lack of a precise, universal definition of frailty, linked in turn to the multidimensional nature of the condition. Eventually, the existing gaps in knowledge are reflected by the absence of effective interventions. Such a barrier may be overcome by developing and validating a robust conceptual framework to achieve a practical operationalisation of frailty. This should precisely define its pathophysiological and clinical foundations, to assist in the design and implementation of specific interventions aimed at restoring robustness and delaying the onset of adverse outcomes. The present \u201cSarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies\u201d (SPRINTT) project is specifically designed to overcome the existing barriers for an efficient public health intervention against frailty, and promote the implementation of successful aging strategies across Europe. \nTo reach such an ambitious goal, the actions of the SPRINTT Consortium are directed towards the achievement of a consensus among academia, regulators, industry (pharmaceutical and medical devices), and patients\u2019 representatives over \n(1) clear operationalisation of the presently vague concept of frailty; \n(2) identification of a target population with unmet medical needs; \n(3) evaluation and validation of methodologies for implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies among frail elders at risk of disability in the European Union; \n(4) definition of an experimental setting as a template for regulatory purposes and pharmaceutical investigations; \n(5) identification of biomarkers and health technology solutions to be implemented into clinical practice. \nThus, the project is expected to pursue all the research deliverables described in nine work-packages.\nThe SPRINTT project proposes a novel operationalisation of physical frailty recognising sarcopenia as its central biological substrate. This approach is based on the fact that the physical frailty phenotype overlaps substantially  with sarcopenia. Indeed, many of the adverse outcomes of frailty are probably mediated by sarcopenia, which may therefore  represent both the biological substrate for the development of physical frailty and the pathway through which the negative health outcomes of frailty ensue. Although physical frailty encompasses only a part of the frailty spectrum, the identification of a definite biological basis (i.e., skeletal muscle decline and loss of mobility function) opens new venues for the development of interventions to slow or reverse the progression of this condition.

It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.

Lack of predictive and prognostic biomarkers for a more accurate patient stratification, limited access to kidney tissue from patients at various stages of DKD and to appropriate model systems to better understand the pathogenesis of the disease, are likely reasons for the stagnating development of new treatments. The BEAt-DKD consortium combines outstanding basic and translational researchers in nephropathy, diabetes, kidney model systems, imaging techniques and systems biology, and includes leaders of diabetes and kidney disease-relevant IMI-1, FP7 and US consortia, like SUMMIT, KIDNEYCONNECT, Syskid, CPROBE and C-Path, in an unprecedented search for new and better biomarkers for DKD, through better understanding of the disease. Jointly, the partners have access to vast and very relevant clinical cohorts and trials, state-of-the-art analysis and imaging techniques, novel model systems and the long-standing experience and networks to make this collaboration a success. By involving regulatory agencies throughout the project, BEAt-DKD aims at making the introduction and acceptance of new tools as efficient as possible. The overall goals of BEAt-DKD are (1) to provide a holistic systems medicine view of the pathogenesis of DKD with the aim to identify targetable mechanisms and pathways underlying initiation and progression of DKD, applying a novel sub-classification of diabetes, and (2) to identify and validate biomarkers of disease progression and treatment responses representing first steps towards precision medicine in the management of DKD.", null, 26983429.0, 11, 31, "BEAt-DKD", null, "http://www.lilly.com", null, "h2020_209459_997585928"], [1485907200000, 1548892800000, "Big Data for Better Outcomes, Policy Innovation and Healthcare System Transformation (DO->IT)", "Eli Lilly and Company Ltd", "The overall goal of the Big Data for Better Outcomes (BD4BO) programme is to facilitate the use of \u2018big data\u2019 to promote the development of value-based, outcomes-focused healthcare systems in Europe.

This paradigm shift requires shared understanding and standards among healthcare stakeholders including patients, providers, payers, regulators, policy makers, pharmaceutical industry, and academia. \n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe proposed Coordination and Support Action (CSA) will establish an enabling platform that brings together these stakeholder groups across the BD4BO programme to ensure quality and consistency of individual projects in line with the overarching programme objective. Our consortium therefore aims to promote the use of big Data for better Outcomes, policy Innovation and healthcare system Transformation (DO->IT). Accordingly, we will: \n\u2022 Define a programme strategy that ensures quality, consistency and sustainability of health outcomes related activities across individual BD4BO projects.\n\u2022 Integrate, synthesise, and manage knowledge from all BD4BO projects, making it easily accessible via a single knowledge exchange platform.\n\u2022 Act as pivotal point of collaboration, stakeholder engagement and communication for all BD4BO projects.\n\u2022 Provide transparency and enable the use of patient health data and human biological samples for research purposes by developing minimum data privacy standards for Informed Consent Forms (ICFs) and supporting materials for use by individual BD4BO disease-specific projects and more widely in the Research and Development (R&D) sector.\n\nCONSORTIUM\nThe multidisciplinary composition, uniting public and private sector stakeholders is the essential feature of the DO->IT consortium. The public membership spans world-leading expertise in health systems and policy, with specific expertise in the definition and use of validated outcomes from real world data sources. It comprises partners from large and small European countries as well as from pan-European and US organisations, disease-specialists from across the range of vertical programmes, including relevant patient organisations for existing and planned BD4BO projects, and representation from all relevant big data stakeholders, for example national decision makers, regulators, registries, healthcare providers, and researchers. The private consortium members include 22 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, national and pan-European pharma industry organisations, EFPIA Partners in Research with significant data management expertise including SMEs and organisations with a pan-European and global footprint. The public and private partners will also contribute their vast experience and networks to build on learnings and best practices of other real world evidence data or big data related IMI projects such as ADAPT-SMART, GetReal, EMIF, EHR4CR, OpenPHACTS and eTRIKS.

However, without a biological rationale for these disorders, drug development has dramatically stagnated in the past decades. In a coordinated effort encompassing academic experts, SMEs, patient and family organizations, regulators, ECNP and EFPIA partners, this project aims to develop a quantitative biological approach to the understanding and classification of neuropsychiatric diseases to accelerate the discovery and development of better treatments for patients. This project will concentrate on Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and Major Depression (MD), as these disorders share part of their symptomatology, in particular social withdrawal and certain cognitive deficits, such as deficits in attention, working memory and sensory processing. By applying innovative technologies (e.g. EEG, cognitive tasks, (f)MRI, smartphone monitoring, and (epi-)genetics) to deep phenotype a clinical cohort of SZ and AD patients combined with a wider analysis of existing clinical data sets from major European and global disease cohorts that also include MD, we will define a set of quantifiable biological parameters best able to cluster and differentiate SZ, AD, and MD patients that do, or do not, exhibit social withdrawal. First, by mining large European SZ, AD and MD cohort datasets with already available social and cognitive proxy measures, and, second, by obtaining objective measures of social exploration levels (using a novel smartphone application), phenotypic relationships with social and cognitive measures will be further tested. For instance we might predict that socially withdrawn individuals may have lower cognitive functioning and poorer clinical course compared to those who are more socially engaged. The two approaches will then come together via selected individuals with low or high social withdrawal who have also been assessed in the deep phenotyping study using integrated behavioural, cognitive, attentional, sensory processing, EEG, and MRI data.\nIn phase I of the project (years 1-3), the clinical deep phenotyping study will provide a proof-of-concept analysis for this quantitative biological approach and will concentrate on SZ and AD patients. To identify shared genetic factors potentially related to the social withdrawal symptom and cognitive deficits observed in these disorders, a cross-disorder genome-wide genetic analysis will be performed in the largest world-wide available samples of SZ, AD, and MD patients. Genetic associations from the global cohorts will be evaluated for their relevance for social withdrawal and cognitive deficits in subsamples with relevant (proxy) phenotypes in large and available European cohorts that have genetic data and clinical proxy data on social withdrawal, sensory processing, attention and working memory available. Data integration of genetic and epigenetic studies through an innovative molecular landscaping approach will lead to the identification of new biological substrates and candidate genes underlying these phenotypic domains. These will provide the basis for reverse translation and construct validation studies in rodents which will be tested in behavioural, cognitive, EEG and O2 amperometry paradigms that are homologous to those performed in the clinical deep phenotyping study. Where appropriate, the clinical studies will inform on the use of appropriate perturbations, including genetic modification to the systems and substrates being probed. Additional preclinical studies will extend the characterisation of the substrates underlying the integrated socio-cognitive traits beyond simple reverse translation by exploiting higher spatial or temporal resolution techniques such as 2-photon imaging, single unit electrophysiology, in vivo micro-dialysis and biosensors.\nTogether, these studies will provide new classification and assessment tools", null, 14746467.0, 8, 23, "PRISM", null, "http://www.lilly.com", null, "h2020_209457_997585928"], [1477958400000, 1635638400000, "Inflammation and AD: modulating microglia function - focussing on TREM2 and CD33", "Eli Lilly and Company Ltd", "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is an age-related chronic neurodegenerative disease with four main pathological changes in the brain: amyloid plaques, fibrillary tau tangles, inflammation and neuronal loss. Phagocytes around amyloid plaques in late onset AD (LOAD) may be neurotoxic but have limited motility and phagocytic activity, suggesting a dysfunctional activation. These phagocytes express the innate immune receptors TREM2 and CD33. Variants of both genes have been linked to LOAD. The main objectives of PHAGO are to find means of modulating microglia/macrophage activation via TREM2, CD33 and related signalling pathways, and determine the effects of such modulation on microglia/macrophage function, amyloid-\u03b2, tau and ultimately neurodegeneration, in order to find a treatment for AD. PHAGO will deliver well characterized tools and knowledge through which to moderate  AD risk and provide targets and markers ready to progress into drug development. PHAGO will realise this goal by simultaneously attacking the problem at multiple levels, including the molecular structures of the receptors, receptor ligand interactions, ectodomain function in vitro and in vivo, characterisation of receptor processing, modification and signalling, receptor-regulated signalling pathways, gene expression and phagocyte function in cells and animals, comprehensive analysis of receptor knock-in and knock-out models crossed to two different animal models of AD, and identification of receptor-related biomarkers in AD patients.  Innovative approaches of PHAGO will include identification of new AD-risk genes using genome analysis and a TREM2 co-expression network approach, brain imaging of AD patients with TREM2 and CD33 variants, and generation of patient iPSC-derived microglia/macrophages to comprehensively phenotype gene variants.

INNODIA aims to achieve a break-through in the way in which we study T1D to enable us to move closer towards prevention and cure of T1D. To this end, INNODIA joins together the leading European experts from the fields of basic and clinical T1D research, four leading pharmaceutical companies with strong expertise in the discovery and development of diabetes medicines and the two leading public organizations involved in T1D research into one comprehensive collaborative consortium. The clinicians in INNODIA oversee T1D registries and have access to large populations of children and adults with T1D and family members at increased risk of developing the disease. The basic science researchers are experts in beta-cell pathophysiology, immunology, biomarker discovery, bioinformatics, systems biology and clinical trial design. INNODIA will accelerate understanding of T1D through coordinated studies of unique clinical samples and translation-oriented preclinical models. This should deliver novel biomarkers and interventions for testing in appropriately designed trials, to be developed in active collaboration with regulators and patients.\nINNODIA provides access to unique historical bio-repositories and will create the Clinical Sample Network, a clinical EU infrastructure to recruit T1D subjects at diagnosis and at-risk relatives. These individuals will be deep-phenotyped and will provide bio-samples, allowing the establishment of a \u2018living biobank\u2019 of subjects consented for recall.
