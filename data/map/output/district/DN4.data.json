However, SMEs lack the knowledge to implement such practices and achieve EEO  due to lack of proper market oriented curricula offered by higher education institutions (HEI)  that will enable the emergence of graduates suitable to tackle EEO concepts. Still, scientific/academic knowledge by HEI can provide solutions for this matter. Alternatively, the industry provides the realistic setting where scientific knowledge can be applied.  However, to be effective, Industry-Academia collaborations should be based on mutual trust, commitment and knowledge exchange/sharing. One way of achieving this \u2018open communication\u2019 between academics and the industry, is through co-creation which is the cornerstone of open innovation practices in today\u2019s industry. For example, through co-creation, academia can gain useful input from industry, that will eventually lead to more market oriented curriculum and better prepared graduates capable to implement EEO.  Hence, open innovation and co-creation between academia and industry/SMEs will highly increase HEI's capacity of producing graduates capable of being next generation leaders in EEO. \r\n\r\nTo this end, the proposed project (Training for Energy Efficient Operations or TrainERGY) responds to this need by aiming to develop an innovative, evidence-based transnational training framework that will markedly improve the knowledge and skills of HEIs to produce more marked oriented EEO curricula, reducing the barriers in this field. The specific objectives of TrainERGY are to: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Establish transnational open collaboration between HEIs  and SMEs across EU in order to address existing training needs in EEO.\r\n\u2022 Define an open-innovation and co-creation framework that will enable a proper development of EEO curricula. \r\n\u2022 Co-create EEO curricula with input from the industry/SMEs. \r\n\u2022 Develop, implement and validate an innovative, evidence-based virtual learning environment (VLE) based on an already developed energy efficiency training tool where feedback from multiple stakeholders (academics, students, industry) will be evaluated and incorporated into the EEO curriculum in an open innovation and co-creation manner.\r\n\r\nThe project consortium comprises 8 key partners (3 universities, 1 academic research centre, 2 SMEs, 1 chamber of commerce and 1 SME association) from different sectors and countries (UK, Greece, Italy, Poland) who will co-create the envisaged EEO curriculum and will pilot it through an open innovation and co-creation VLE.  The four academic partners from the consortium have been previously engaged into a project (PrESS) which delivered a training needs analysis (TNA) for SMEs as well as an online decision making/training tool for SMEs, both related to energy efficiency.  In TrainERGY, the consortium will use its transnational, cross-sectoral, wide expertise and findings from PrESS in order to develop the following activities: Specialize the needs emerged from PrESS to the current context; Co-create with industry ECTS accredited EEO curriculum; Develop a VLE where feedback from stakeholders will be used to enhance the EEO curriculum; Implement transnational co-creation/training sessions and pilot the VLE; and ensure high quality of the outputs as well as a targeted dissemination and impact of the project. \r\n\r\nThe expected impact for HEIs is the following: Enhancement of university-industry collaboration and better alignment of the curriculum to fit the EU market through co-creation with industry in an open innovation framework; Internationalization of higher education; Development of new cutting-edge (ECTS accredited) EEO curriculum and course delivery mechanisms (based on the latest technologies- VLE) increasing the value delivered to the students; Transnational mobility that will lead to opportunities for capacity building capitalized through high quality publications and strong networking for possible fund/grant applications.

It extends on the right side of the River Guadalquivir. Agriculture is the main activity of the population: orange, wheat and corn, and there is an unemployed population of 2,678 people. In this context, the IES aims to promote the vocational training of students and to promote entrepreneurship and innovation so that our young people have the possibility of quality employment in the near future.\r\n\r\nWith these international stays, it is intended to supplement the training that these young people have acquired during their studies, and offer them the opportunity to improve a second language and acquire international experience. With this, the most immediate results will increase the employability of participants, facilitating their employment, while the European objectives are addressed in this regard.\r\n\r\nTORRE DE LOS GUZMANES is addressed to 15 young people enrolled in the same institutional center: 10 of them will do their vocational training curricula experience abroad, and the other 5 will do it once they have been qualified. In addition, these young people will be accompanied by 3 tutors who will be in the first 5 days of the stays.\r\n\r\nThe stays will take place in two exits: for the 10 that will make their curricula stage abroad, from March to May of 2018; For the 5 graduated, from September to December 2018. 8 young people will go to Italy, the other 7 to the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe sector on which the project will rotate is the Technician of Conducting Physical-Sports Activities in the Natural Environment\r\n\r\nParticipants will receive linguistic support through the online tool provided by the ERASMUS + program in English and Italian.

The RA implementation and the toolbox will be validated through realistic pilots involving stakeholders in the identification, assessment and mitigation of threats. The five pilots involve high-impact scenarios including SWIFT network protection, buildings and ATM networks security, peer-to-peer payments network protection, risk assessment for insurance purposes and securing financial SMEs. \nThe pilots will engage >=500 security & finance experts, while providing a representative coverage of the financial services industry (ie. banking, capital management, insurance, card & P2P payments), which is a sound basis for FINSEC\u2019s broader impact.
