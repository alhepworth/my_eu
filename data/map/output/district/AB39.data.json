From 2020 every child is entitled to learn a first additional language from primary one and a second by primary five. This is known as the '1+2' Initiative. \r\n\r\nAt Dunnottar school we have a very enthusiastic team of practitioners with a broad range of experience and varying levels of competency in modern languages who are committed to embedding the 1+2 approach in their daily practice. However, it is felt by many colleagues that they have a need to up-skill their own competence in language learning and teaching. We believe that an immersion trip, like the one being offered by Erasmus+, will benefit all practitioners because not only will it improve their language competences but it will bring a vital authentic cultural dimension to their teaching of languages; a dimension that it is simply not possible to achieve from UK based Continuing Lifelong Professional Learning alone. \r\n\r\nWe are a forward thinking and progressive school and we are keen to add a European/International dimension to our curriculum. Oil and Gas has been the primary industry in the North East of Scotland for many years now. As such, the  demographic in this part of the country is relatively broad, with many nationalities represented. We are keen to build on this and demonstrate to our young people the many benefits of learning another language and of international travel. We feel that an experience such as the one offered by Erasmus+ will support us in this endeavour. \r\n\r\nSeven members of staff from Dunnottar School have applied to take part in the LFEE Immersion trip to France in July 2017. They include teachers from the infant, middle and upper school, as well as a Pupil Support Assistant who works with several classes across all stages in the school. The participants have a broad and varied level of language competence and all are committed and enthusiastic practitioners who are very keen to develop language learning at Dunnottar. Only three of the seven applicants have visited France before and they strongly believe that an immersion trip of this nature and quality will equip them with the skills and experience necessary to bring language learning to life in their classrooms. \r\n\r\nFor participants, the Immersion course will serve to improve their methodological expertise in the teaching of French to our young learners. They will gain a broader and deeper understanding of how language is taught and developed in European countries, as well as improving their own competence, confidence and performance in the French language. This up-skilling will enable our staff to embed languages in their daily classroom practice with increasing confidence. Furthermore, It is felt that participation in the Erasmus+ experience will provide participants with greater cultural awareness of contemporary France, thus giving their teaching an authentic dimension and 'bringing to life' the learning of languages within our school setting. \r\n\r\nUpon their return from France, the staff members involved will be invited to share their experiences at authority, cluster and school level. Aberdeenshire Council runs regular 1+2 Inservice Training Days, attended by colleagues from all over the authority. Previous participants in the LFEE Immersion trips to France and Spain have shared their positive experiences of the course at these events. It is envisaged that our very enthusiastic team will do likewise. Furthermore, we propose to make use of GLOW (The Scottish Schools Intranet) to share our learning and experiences with colleagues from across Scotland. \r\n\r\nWe are confident that our team will grasp this incredible opportunity with both hands and use the experience gained to develop themselves as classroom practitioners and leaders of language learning while, at the same time, instilling in our young people a love of languages, an appreciation of the opportunities that language learning can bring and a desire to develop themselves as global citizens.", "http://www.dunnottar.aberdeenshire.sch.uk/", "Dunnottar Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035920_coordinator"]]}}, "2TD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Immersion Training", "Mill O'Forest Primary School", 10087.0, 1, 1, "Five staff from our primary school will attend primary immersion courses provided by LFEE Europe, spending one week in either France or Spain.

This is part of our SQUIP this year, and will remain on the plan until 2020 when we hope to have this embedded across the school in line with Scottish and Aberdeenshire initiatives. In our last application, we expressed our need to raise standards of learning and teaching in Spanish in order to put our P7s on a level playing field with all other cluster P7s.  Whist this is improving, it is not quite there yet. We aim to provide high quality learning and teaching experiences for all 350 children at Newtonhill School, across the curriculum.  We would like to bring the Spanish learning and teaching experiences up to the high standard we expect in other curricular areas, and so asked for further staff volunteers to attend the LFEE Level 1 Spanish Immersion Course in Malaga during this year's summer holiday, and encouraged the staff who had successfully completed the Level 1 course to apply for Level 2. We are therefore applying for funding for 8 staff with a view to these staff to starting to or continuing to, at a higher level,:\r\n\r\ndevelop and/or share a range of resources and training/support activities;\r\npresent these to staff in our own school and other schools in our cluster network;\r\nlead department and whole school assemblies, including parent assemblies, with Spanish theme or some Spanish content;\r\nwork with staff across the authority to share their experiences to inspire and motivate across Aberdeenshire and/or Scotland;\r\ndevelop existing and create new links with classes in Spain so that learners across our school have experience of an etwinning project or similar, in order to promote global and particularly European citizenship;\r\nwork in school and beyond to create manageable, sustainable but high quality short-, medium- and long-term planning of the teaching and learning of foreign languages, developing contexts suitable for all ages across primary school.\r\n\r\nHaving had some staff attend the high quality immersion course, and seen the impact it has had on them, their classes and those around them, we realise the more staff we can put on that training, the better.  Although some staff have fully embraced the 1+2 initiative, some less confident ones are very much still at the \"toe in the water\" stage.  The more fully trained staff we have, the better we can support those teachers who do not wish to undertake any further training yet, by putting confident, skilled staff in as stage language leaders to train, support and team-teach with them, as we are about to start doing with our eTwinning projects this term.\r\n\r\nWe are beginning to adopt a whole school cross-curricular approach to learning and teaching modern foreign languages at Newtonhill.  Getting started on the etwinning website has made it apparent to our staff what opportunities there are to teach languages and ICT together, through use of the twinspace, digital photography and film-making.  We share our learning with our parents and the wider school community through Twitter, and often share our Spanish language learning on our Twitter feed, (@Newtonhill_Sch), including our Spanish of the Week.  Staff who have volunteered to attend the Level 2 immersion course include 3 members of the management team, 1 of whom is 50% class committed, the other 80%.

In our local authority, primary schools work with their area schools network to allocate languages for P6 and P7 to ensure an even spread of learners with experiences of the modern foreign language they will learn in S1 and 2 at their academy.  Therefore, in our network, because the languages taught in S1 are French and Spanish, half the P6s and 7s should receive French language tuition, and half Spanish.  Newtonhill School must teach and learn Spanish, and we are very keen to do this to a high standard, but none of the staff have any knowledge of Spanish.  We have more than 380 pupils at Newtonhill School, and we aim to provide high quality learning and teaching experiences for all children across the curriculum.  We would like to bring the Spanish learning and teaching experiences up to the high standard we expect in other curricular areas, and so asked for staff volunteers to attend the LFEE Spanish Immersion Course in Malaga during this year's summer holiday.  We are applying for funding for 4 staff with a view to these staff:\r\n\r\nsharing and/or developing a range of resources and training/support activities;\r\npresenting these to staff in our own school and other schools in our cluster network;\r\nleading department and whole school assemblies, including parent assemblies, with Spanish theme or some Spanish content;\r\nworking with staff across the authority to share their experiences to inspire and motivate across Aberdeenshire and/or Scotland;\r\ndevelop existing and create new links with classes in Spain so that learners across our school have experience of an etwinning project or similar, in order to promote global and particularly European citizenship;\r\nworking in school and beyond to create manageable, sustainable but high quality short-, medium- and long-term planning of the teaching and learning of foreign languages, developing contexts suitable for all ages across primary school.\r\n\r\nHigh quality training and resources are desperately needed.  The immersion course will be a continuation of short upskilling courses in Spanish language, and will come after a year of a \"toe in the water\" approach to teaching Spanish across the school.  We have already initiated some very small-scale etwinning projects with schools in France and Spain, which has made us appreciate how advanced in foreign language learning similar-aged children are in Europe.   \r\n\r\nWe are trying to adopt a whole school cross-curricular approach to learning and teaching modern foreign languages at Newtonhill.  Getting started on the etwinning website has made it apparent to our staff what opportunities there are to teach languages and ICT together, through use of the twinspace, digital photography and film-making.  We share our learning with our parents and the wider school community through Twitter, and will go on to incorporate our Spanish language learning on our Twitter feed, starting with the children putting on an example of good pronunciation of our \"Spanish of the Week\".  Staff who have volunteered to attend the immersion course include 3 members of the management team, 2 of whom are at least 50% class committed.  We feel this is beneficial as it ensures that the embedding of MFL teaching in Newtonhill School is coming from school leaders who are in a position to change and improve school planning, resources, budgeting and provision of Career-Long Professional Learning opportunities to reflect our whole school needs, and to benefit staff who were not free to volunteer to attend the immersion course this summer.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to run European projects in various classes across the school each year, both through etwinning and in more traditional ways.  As previously mentioned, we are trying to work in line with local and national guidelines to plan and teach Spanish to at least P1-3 this year.  This will be extended over the next 2 or 3 years to include P4-7, again in line with local guidelines in order to try and meet national priorities by 2020 of providing the learning and teaching of an L2 (which of course for us is Spanish) to the whole school, and experiences of other languages to P5-7.  Staff will incorporate their development in learning and teaching Spanish into their yearly Career-Long Professional Learning requirement, and will be supported through this by a series of planned courses and events run in conjunction with Aberdeenshire development officers.  We are committed to the development of this project and will do our best to take the entire school community along with us.", "http://www.newtonhill.aberdeenshire.sch.uk", "Newtonhill School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035670_coordinator"]]}}, "3YG": {"cordis": {"data": [[1383264000000, 1446249600000, "Boosted barley utilisation and consumption in the EU for better health", "Macphie of Glenbervie Ltd", "The two year project for boosted usage of barley in Europe involves nine partners who represent seven countries in Europe.

The huge market demand is currently met almost exclusively by synthetic, mainly petroleum-based, chemical products, which are usually non-biodegradable and mostly toxic or GM plant based products (used in foods), which are undesirable by some end-users. Their biologically produced counterparts (i.e. bio-surfactants and bio-emulsifiers) offer more green sustainable alternatives. This has led to a number of manufactures, looking for ways to increase competitiveness through searching for underexploited sources such as the marine environment. Our objectives are to develop (1) innovative approaches in discovering, characterizing and producing novel marine-derived bio-surfactants from a large bacterial collection (greater than 500 strains) housed at Heriot Watt University, originally isolated from various coastal and open ocean waters around the world, (2) novel, economic, and eco-friendly end-products with commercial applications in order to replace synthetic counterparts, and (3) to demonstrate the functionality of new product development for commercial exploitation. Our collection consists of novel bacterial species, originally isolated for their ability to degrade oils, with proven promise in this respect. For this reason, our consortium (consisting of academic institutions, industrial companies and end-users) offering a wide range of expertise, will address the technical bottlenecks for meeting our objectives, namely those of marine resource identification, sustainable supply, discovery pipeline and efficient production in biological systems. The relevance of our proposal to the work programme is underlined by its expected impact in increasing efficiency of discovery pipelines, the development of more economic and eco-friendly end-products and finally in contributing to the implementation of the objectives of the EU Blue Growth.", 127916.0, 4038810.0, 6, 13, "MARISURF", null, "http://www.macphie.com", null, "h2020_193327_968693508"]]}}}}
