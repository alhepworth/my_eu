Three of the students are from the fashion department. As our students are trained in modern languages, we have chosen the following countries for the internship: Italy, France, Malta, Ireland, Spain and Great Britain. Our students will be trained in theory (language skills) and in practice beforehand. Additionally, they will be supported by the Erasmus+ team (contact via WhatsApp/facebook) during the internship.After the internship an evaluation will be carried out by the partner hotel. Means of evaluation will be the ECVET \u2013 form and the Learning Agreement.Students are encouraged to gain further practical knowledge and skills in hotel industry which have already been provided in theory in order to be well-prepared for their future working life. Therefore our students should be given the possibility to work in fields like:restaurant, reception, bar, administration, room service, housekeeping, concierge, seminar and conference area. From our point of view, there will be a noticeable increase in the employability because of the internship.Besides improving their practical skills, our trainees should strengthen their social skills and their self-confidence (personal capabilities), which means that responsibility, independency, self-confidence, ability to work on their own, team spirit, ability to listen, friendliness, ability to communicate with their superiors, colleagues and guests. Moreover, our students should encounter the differences of various cultures and traditions and their characteristics to develop an open-minded tolerance.Another important aim is to improve language skills. Students should be able to use their acquired language skills in order to broaden their communication skills in daily work life.Furthermore, we would like to stress that the sense of belonging to the European Union should be created and increased to make the EU be realized as a chance for personal and professional development. Employing foreign students in their hotels, people show interest in different nationalities and also in the willingness to train and support the young. This will be documented by using the following tools: Letter of Intent, Learning Agreement, Personal Transcript, Europass and ECVET. The hotel is not only a working but also learning place.We are primarily looking for hotels in the 4 or 5 stars category to ensure a high standard not only concerning the working but also the learning conditions. In cooperation with the Erasmus+ Team the students work out tasks of the Learning Agreement and the results will be discussed. Teachers will visit their students at their hotels to deepen the personal contact and to assure the quality of the internship.For school, this project is evidence of a professionally grounded education, which will finally be documented by annual reports, parents\u2019 evening, Erasmus+ Day, personal diary entries of the participants as well as broadcasts in the media (local TV, newspapers, websites).The aspired project goals are assured by a professional quality management team (G. Malle, B. Potz, M-A. Schwarz) and teachers working in the fields of economy and modern languages.ECVET elements will be used to emphasize comparison and sustainability of the project. Using these tools, the cooperation with the hotels will be intensified. That\u2019s why increased action of the accompanying teachers will be necessary especially at the beginning.Apart from the EU aspect, long-term impacts on the participant, school site and the Austrian educational system are stressed.

Short and ultrashort pulsed lasers enable producing structures with sub-micron accuracy, for example diesel injection nozzles which help reducing air pollution significantly when compared to nozzles made by conventional fabrication techniques. So far, most of the powerful industrial ultrafast laser sources are operating in the picosecond range, which is sufficient for precision micro-machining of metals. On the other hand, to achieve optimum precision in micro-machining of transparent materials like glass and ceramics, pulse durations in the order of 100 femtoseconds are required. Therefore, the main objective of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of industrial high-average power ultrafast Ti:sapphire (Ti:Sa) lasers and their excellent qualification for demanding high-productivity precision laser mate-rial processing applications. To achieve the targeted high output powers, the thin-disk (TD) geometry shall be employed, which already enabled the efficient generation of up to 740 W of cw fundamental mode power from one Yb:YAG crystal. Symmetrical double-sided cooling with two transparent diamond heat spreaders shall be used to optimize the cooling of the thin Ti:Sa crystal. Within the project, two ultrafast Ti:Sa TD laser systems, one with chirped pulse amplification (CPA) to obtain high-energy pulses and the other without CPA for high repetition rates, both with a maximum average output power of at least 200 W at a pulse duration of well below 100 fs shall be demonstrated. The CPA system, comprising a multipass TD amplifier, shall achieve a pulse energy of 10 mJ at 20 kHz repetition rate. The multipass amplifier will be pumped by two nanosecond pulsed frequency-doubled solid-state lasers developed within the project which are operating at 532 nm with an average output power of 300 W each. The high-repetition rate system shall be a high-power TD oscillator with a pulse energy of 20 \u00b5J at about 10 MHz. A commercial cw Yb:YAG TD laser with intracavity frequency doubling emitting about 500 W at 515 nm shall be used as pump source.
