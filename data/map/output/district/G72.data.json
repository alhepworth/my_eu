The teacher training will allow us to improve the competence of our attending staff member and in turn all others in our department, school and learning community, as well as any influence she may then have more regionally (other schools, councils, and the wider teacher community). The chosen staff member is a fully trained and qualified member of staff with more experience teaching in Spanish than French. Therefore application to undergo course in France will be of huge benefit. This is a strong candidate who will benefit greatly from personal development in both teaching strategies and language competence by undergoing this mobility project. \r\nFurther training in language and methodology will help to embed the target language (in this case French) into our school here in Blantyre, Scotland. \r\nAdditionally, the project will help us to follow the new national curriculum more closely, with special attention to the 1+2 policy,  and also to find partner schools abroad. This will really help us to raise the profile of language learning, making it more relevant, up to date, and really capture the interest of our learners. Getting pupils to use ICT to communicate with other schools in the UK and abroad will help improve their communication skills in a number of ways and will make them better European citizens as well as more employable citizens. Improved language teaching and learning will make our students successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens. The European dimension through the teaching of languages will be much greater and will ensure our students and teachers are more aware. \r\nThis mobility project will help our staff contextualise language learning better for our learners, showing them that this is something that\u2019s not only a valuable tool, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s enjoyable, fun and attainable as well. New teaching methods and tools gained will help staff to make communication for learners even better and learning more relevant as well as one of the most important factors: promoting tolerance and understanding for other cultures, which is something that our learners who come from highly deprived areas and backgrounds, will really benefit from. Better tools and teaching methods will help staff to normalise language education here in Blantyre.

This will result in i) growing dynamic stability issues for the power system (possibly a new major barrier against future renewable penetration), ii) the necessity to upgrade existing protection schemes and iii) measures to mitigate the resulting degradation of power quality due to harmonics propagation. European TSOs from Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and UK have joined to address such challenges with manufacturers (Alstom, Enercon, Schneider Electric) and universities/research centres. They propose innovative solutions to progressively adjust the HVAC system operations. Firstly, a replicable methodology is developed for appraising the distance of any EU 28 control zone to instability due to PE proliferation and for monitoring it in real time, along with a portfolio of incremental improvements of existing technologies (the tuning of controllers, a pilot test of wide-area control techniques and the upgrading of protection devices with impacts on the present grid codes). Next, innovative power system control laws are designed to cope with the lack of synchronous machines. Numerical simulations and laboratory tests deliver promising control solutions together with recommendations for new PE grid connection rules and the development of a novel protection technology and mitigation of the foreseen power quality disturbances.

Together, these four innovations have a long-term cost reduction potential of over 50%. These are: a 50% more efficient turbine, latching and predictive control, a shared mooring system for wave energy similar to those that have reduced mooring costs 50% in aquaculture, and an elastomeric mooring tether that reduces peak loads at the hull-mooring connection 70% and thus addresses one of the most pressing challenges for structural survivability of wave energy devices. \n\nDocumenting and sharing this open-sea experience will also induce a step-change in our knowledge of risk and uncertainties, costs and societal and environmental impacts of wave energy.
