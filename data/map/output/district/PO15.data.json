The consortium is coordinated by IIS J.F. Kennedy.The project will involve 110 students of the penultimate year before the diploma; the mobility will be of 5 weeks, in summer 2017, heading to France, Spain, Germany, Ireland, United Kingdom. Before the departure, the participants will receive accurate preparation activities. The preparation will be completed abroad, where, during the first week, the participants will be given a language and cultural training, together with introductory lectures to the internship, which will consist in 4 weeks full-time work placements in different companies according to their professional profile.The project  is set in a geographical context which is called the Bassa Padovana area, in the South part of the Venetian region, which is characterized by an economy that is continuously suffering from the shortage of job occupation due to the financial and economic crisis. What is more, really radical historical and cultural conditionings and the permanence of genre and ethnic stereotypes make difficult to change behaviours and organization models of small enterprises and limit the necessary innovation processes.In this context, the project  offered the young people important formative opportunities by means of the mobility activities that helped  them to improve the relationships with the other, either at genre or culture of origin levels, to perceive  the difference as a resource , not only as a limit. Together with the enhancement of linguistic and professional \u201ctools\u201d, the project highlighted the intercultural consciousness as one of the essential competences to start up a revival processes which might favour the employment linked to the potential touristic attractiveness of the territory.The touristic offer can be innovative if it is gifted also on a human level personalisation, which requires the operators to master some competences to be improved through the transnational mobility. These competences concern some soft skills such as ability to have an open vision towards society, relational skills, self-entrepreneurship, flexibility personal organisation as well as specific technical skills.  The professional profiles involved are related to Tourism and other linked sectors: services (marketing and administration, information technology, restaurants and hotel accommodation), agri-food and environment management.The common goals to the different professional profiles are aimed at the acquisition or enhancement of the following skills:1-To interact by using Foreign languages 2- To positively face new cultural contexts, 3- To adapt to unfamiliar situations, to be flexible, mindful and interested towards new experiences and to live them as a learning opportunity 4-To practise personal autonomy by means of daily training of self-organization and of stress management5- To build-up constructive relationships and to take charge of responsibilities at work  6- To acquire or develop some professional skills The mobility is integrated in the sending school curriculum and it is recognised as equivalent to the school-work Alternance (work based learning); therefore, the application of ECVET procedures in organizing and implementing the work experience abroad will enable the recognition of credits. The participants will also receive the Europass Mobility Document, the Certificate of Competencies, in addition to the other certifications foreseen, which will enrich the personal portfolio for entering the labour market.The continuity with the previous Project editions strengthens the collaboration of the members of the national and international partnership, and it improves the shared practices applied to organize, manage and evaluate the mobility. This continuity is also a condition for the success of the Mobility experience, whose impact will be measured by a follow-up Observatory of the sending schools in the three years after the conclusion of the Project.

Such delay causes increased emissions and noise in the vicinity of the airport, as well as increasing the aircraft operator\u2019s fuel costs. Greater congestion increases the air traffic control workload and can result in less efficient aircraft profiles.\nTo reduce airborne delays near the destination airport and the associated negative effects, two concepts can be used. One is to adjust an aircraft\u2019s departure time by holding it on the ground so that its arrival time avoids the predicted peak in arriving traffic. Other methods involve trajectory extension or slowing down an aircraft in flight. This requires the arrival sequence to be calculated earlier than in current operations so that action can be taken early enough to have a meaningful effect.\nThe XSTREAM project will demonstrate the benefits gained through this latter concept. These methods can be used in combination with the former concept, traditionally regarded as a network management action, but refined through the use of arrival management tools. The project will demonstrate the use of arrival management techniques for pre-departure aircraft, the calculation, updating and passing of arrival management actions for airborne aircraft such as target time, time-to-lose/gain, or speed advisory from the destination arrival management system to upstream control units, and the impact of multiple arrival constraints within an Upper Airspace Control unit.\nThe operational demonstrations will be performed upon aircraft arriving at Paris CDG and Orly, London Heathrow and Gatwick, and Zurich.

Safe separations prescribed to avoid potential hazards by encounters with a preceding aircraft\u2019s wake are a main limiting factor for airport capacity. Increasing airport congestion and the introduction of very large aircraft initiated extensive investigations, involving researchers, aircraft and equipment manufacturers and operational users (airports, pilots, ATC). Two main questions are still open: \u00b7 if the separations by MTOW can be replaced by a more physically based rulemaking, \u00b7 if separations can be dynamically reduced with on-ground or on-board advisory and detection systems to increase airport capacity, both with constant or even increasing safety level. In the last decade activities have progressed from physical understanding to development of operational concepts and rulemaking. Several EU-funded and other projects are ongoing or starting in this field. For successful concept implementation, acceptance by operational users is mandatory. This requires continuous dialogue between scientists and users. Like previous Networks, WakeNet3-Europe will be the forum for this dialogue, building a bridge between wake vortex research and operations, in order to get scientifically funded agreement among stakeholders to support implementation, and to help making new technologies (e. g. advisory systems) usable for wake vortex purposes.
