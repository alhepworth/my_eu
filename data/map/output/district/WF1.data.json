We will be staying at a tent camp surrounded by nature, where we\u2019ll be able to explore the greenery, learn about the state of our world, inspect the differences and similarities in our lifestyles and figure out solutions on how to live a sustainable life together.Project objectives:a) Our main goal is to realize that our Earth exists only once and that all our resources are limited. The participants are going to concern themselves with the way our international merchandise control wastes our resources, so that they will understand that a sustainable lifestyle is necessary if we want to preserve Earth for future generations.b) Our second aim is to discuss and work out practical ideas on how to live a sustainable life. Some incentives are going to be given, some should be worked out by the participants themselves and are then supposed to be documented.c) A sub-goal is to reach the conclusion that the conservation of nature and our natural resources is an issue that concerns all the people of the world. The effort of only a few single nations is merely going to shift the problems some place else instead of permanently solving them. Only a joint effort by the global community will achieve this.d) Our second sub-goal is to establish a cross-cultural communication between the participants by focusing on our similarities while also not disregarding our cultural differences.We're going to organize this activity as an international youth exchange at a tent camp in the forest \u201cSteigerwald\u201d (near Erfurt) since there have already been partnerships between national youth groups for years. This camp will take place during the Thuringian summer holidays so that the German youth can participate without a problem.The result should be to give the participants a broader worldview instead of only thinking nationally when looking into environmental protection measures. We hope that these steps will give young people an incentive to live a more sustainable life and to make them realize their responsibilities in shaping a pluralistic society.

The objective of VITRUV is the development of software tools for the long and complex screening process, which is urban planning, moving across three levels from concept to plan to detail design. Based on an all hazard risk approach, the tools will enable planners\n\u2022 to make well-considered systematic qualitative decisions (concept level),\n\u2022 to analyse the susceptibility of urban spaces (e.g. building types, squares, public transport, and their functionalities) with respect to new threats (plan level), and\n\u2022 to perform vulnerability analyses of urban spaces by computing the likely damage on individuals, buildings, traffic infrastructure (detail level).\nAll levels (concept, plan and detail) will contribute to enabling the development of more robust and resilient space in the field of urban (re)planning/(re)design/(re)engineering. Planners who use VITRUV\u2019s tools will be able to deliver urban space less prone to and less affected by attacks and disasters, thus sustainably improving the security of citizens", 60187.0, 3800321.0, 8, 12, "VITRUV", "http://www.vitruv-project.eu/consortium.html", "http://www.westyorkshire.police.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-11/57381.jpg", "fp7_98970_996645319"], [1398902400000, 1461974400000, "Cybercrime and cyberterrOrism (E)Uropean Research AGEnda", "Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire", "The COuRAGE (Cybercrime and cyberterrOrism (E)UropeanResearch AGEnda ) consortium will deliver a measured, comprehensive, relevant research agenda for Cyber Crime and Cyber Terrorism (CC/CT) guided by the knowledge and experience of the highly experienced and exceptionally qualified consortium (16 partners, 11 countries) and Advisory Board members (14 organisations including EUROPOL, JRC and ERA).

The purpose of COuRAGE is to significantly improve the security of citizens and critical infrastructures and support crime investigators.\nThe COuRAGE approach builds on three pillars, namely:-a user centric methodology, to identify gaps, challenges and barriers based on real-world needs and experiences; an analytical and semantic approach, to deliver a taxonomy and create a common understanding of the subject with all stakeholders; and, a competitive and market oriented approach, to foster practical implementations of counter-measures using effective test and validation solutions.

Entrepreneurial skills as solid base for a future in the Creative Industry\u201d project has as central aim to support the (young) (female) entrepreneurs and companies and its employees in the creative sector to go through a transformation and innovation process that is necessary to survive the present times and to become a company with a sustainable business case. The project results will be the relevant profiles of the companies at various stages in this path of development until the year 2026, learning material and digital tools.The core of the company profiles will be the description of core competences and entrepreneurial skills that have to be present in the company at management level and the entrepreneurial skills at the level of the employees.ContextThe Creative Industry has always been part of the communication and information industry. Over the last 30 years the industry has gone through a great deal of technological changes and revolutions. From a manual manufacturing industry dominated by production and output based companies, single channel companies, a change-over to full service communication and information companies, multi-channel companies are now needed. Technology has always been the main (sole) driver for initiating change in the companies. In many cases there is no real research based analyses to support the implementation of the production tools financially. Market research is not a strong point of the entrepreneurs.Goals, results and impact.The aim of this project is to develop innovative ways of learning about entrepreneurship and company development and to promote and create awareness on these subjects in schools and companies in the industry. This awareness is the start to implement the appropriate tools and strategies to drive that road up hill to a sustainable future in this extremely interesting Creative Industry of the future.The company profiles connected to the three direct target groups will be the foundation of the three learning modules that we will focus on. Modern, entrepreneurial skills that will support the individual and company development into a full service provider in the Creative Industry. The modules will have various work formats, from workshops to blended learning assignments with shared responsibilities of the students.An E-tool will be developed for benchmarking and self-assessment. Individuals and companies can apply the e-tool to benchmark their present position on the development scale that has been implemented in the tool, based on the company profiles. By doing this self-assessment, the individuals or companies will get a clear analysis of the gaps they have in entrepreneurial sense to have a successful transformation to the desired situation.Long termThe effect of working in a sustainable manner on the development of a company in the Creative Industry, in particular the communication sector, to get a better connection between the entrepreneur, the company, its customers and their needs. A higher level of customer experience will lead to more employee satisfaction. This all has to be managed by an entrepreneur with the adequate skills. In this way the company can be more profitable and more competitive.
