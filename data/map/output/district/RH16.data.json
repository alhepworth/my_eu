It builds a partnership of six organisations from five countries, all of whom have direct influence on the practice of school leaders. \r\n\r\nThe overall aim is to develop an induction, coaching and mentoring programme for newly appointed school leaders, which exploits the proven expertise and capacity of experienced and recently retired members of partner organisations/associations. The partner organisations are in a unique position to exploit this expertise and already have a clear picture of need at a national level. Three of them have a dedicated 'retired members section'. They all have substantial experience of offering professional development. \r\n\r\nThe objectives are to:\r\n\u2022 establish a database in partner countries of high quality recently retired successful school leaders and select a team of trainers\r\n\u2022 audit the priority needs of new school leaders across the partnership\r\n\u2022 set up an online platform about the project and to host the resources\r\n\u2022 create a coaching and mentoring programme for new school leaders\r\n\u2022 train the trainers \r\n\u2022 pilot the coaching and mentoring programme with 150 new headteachers\r\n\u2022 evaluate and finalise the resources\r\n\u2022 create a set of case studies\r\n\u2022 disseminate and promote the resources\r\n\u2022 expand the programme into other countries \r\n\r\nThere is much room for improvement to professionalise school leadership, to support current school leaders and to make school leadership an attractive career for future candidates. School leadership is a priority for the EU. This project focuses on how to up-skill school leaders, particularly in their early years of leadership. This is seen as a priority in the ET 2020 agenda if progress to meet targets on school performance is to be accelerated. \r\n\r\nThe project has a number of main stages each with their own milestones and indicators and is divided into 3 sets of Intellectual Outputs.  These will be:\r\n\r\n  \u2022   An Integrated Platform, to host the project website, online resources and virtual community and network building tool\r\n  \u2022   A coaching and mentoring programme for new school leaders and a set of pilot training modules\r\n  \u2022   A set of final downloadable training modules for coaches, mentors and newly appointed school leaders, supported by an e-handbook \r\n\r\nIn total there will be 50 coaches and mentors and 150 newly qualified Headteachers involved. An additional 30 key stakeholders per partner country will be targeted in the multiplier events, a total of 180 across the partnership. The final international conference will target 60 stakeholders at national and EU levels.", "http://www.naht.org.uk", "National Association of Headteachers", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036832_coordinator"]]}}, "2DX": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Lindfield Primary School French and Spanish Project", "Lindfield primary School", 5300.0, 1, 1, "Project Aims - To introduce French teaching in KS2 in line with new requirements.
