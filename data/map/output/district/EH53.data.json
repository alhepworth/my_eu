It is viewed as a factor in opening the door to options and experiences which are not available to those who are limited to one language. Through taking part in the French immersion course, the staff at Pumpherston and Uphall Community Primary School aim to develop and embed their French language skills as well as extending our awareness of French life and culture. Three members of staff, who teach across all stages of the school, want to take part in a local French language course.\r\n\r\nAs the immersion courses provided by LFEE are delivered by a team of experienced and fully qualified native teachers committed to promoting French language and culture, this course will enable the staff involved to experience a variety of teaching ideas, methodologies and resources, which all staff in our school will benefit from. Following the course, the participants plan to actively develop French teaching resources and pedagogy, working collaboratively with other school staff members to promote confidence in teaching French.  The group are hoping to take forward a celebration of French language and culture to the whole school in the session 2018/19.\r\n\r\nThe three members of staff who attend the immersion course will receive certificates of attendance and the two teaching staff will have the opportunity to gain professional recognition from the General Teaching Council for Scotland. As a result of undertaking the immersion course, the pupils within all classes will benefit from increased confidence of staff when teaching French and the progression of learning in French will be enhanced.  Participants will also seek to increase pupils\u2019 awareness of the cultural aspects of France. These benefits will impact on our pupil's enthusiasm and commitment to learning a second language, and hopefully they will positively influence their uptake of modern languages at the senior phase. \r\n\r\nParticipants are hoping to set up a simple eTwinning project and invite cultural organizations (such as SCILT - Scottish Centre for International Language Teaching) into the school to help deliver a whole school assembly. This, in turn, will raise the profile of modern languages amongst our school community.  Our senior leadership team will also monitor the implementation of the 1+2 language policy within the school and gather robust evidence as to how it is being implemented. There will be a positive impact on all staff in our school as the staff involved in the immersion course will gain training and skills that they will be able to cascade to other staff in school. In addition, by contacting the local 1+2 development officer and using the West Lothian 1+2 SharePoint, participants will be in a position to share their training and practice, both at a local and national level.", null, "Pumpherston and Uphall Station Community Primary school", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047279_coordinator"], [2014, "Modern Languages Programme", "Pumpherston and Uphall Station Community Primary school", 1861.0, 1, 1, "The Scottish government has introduced a new policy in the teaching and learning of languages; the 1+2 approach, as endorsed by the European Union.  This will entitle every child at school in Scotland to be taught one foreign language from Primary 1 upwards, and be exposed to the culture and language of one other people group in the later years of their Primary education.  Here at Pumpherston and Uphall Station Community Primary we have been teaching French in the Nursery for several years and with each year developing the school programme for language to its current position where French is taught in every year group from the Nursery upwards. The development of a progression of skills and vocabulary across the school presents a challenge to the staff teaching French, especially in keeping their knowledge of the language up to date, and their ideas of French culture up to date and relevant to the children's lives.  Our objective is to have a language programme which shows progression in breadth and depth through the school and to have staff with stronger knowledge of French and a range of methods available to teach it.  We want to build on what we have and use the ideas and techniques gained through the experience of one teacher attending a full immersion course in French to develop the current French programme and give a basis for introducing a second modern language in the upper school.  We also seek to develop more meaningful contexts through which children will be taught the language and also have opportunities to apply the skills they develop, e.g. through e-twinning. \r\n\r\nThis teacher has shown her commitment to language teaching by introducing and developing the French taught at early stages of the curriculum. She takes seriously her professional responsibility to develop her knowledge of the language.   Following the course she will use the ideas gained to review our programme and resources, to report back to children on her experiences in France and share the excitement of travel and exploring different cultures. She will use the new techniques and resources to refresh her teaching and will involve the children, staff and management in assessing the effectiveness of the new material.  She will also share the skills gained with other members of staff and encourage them to incorporate short periods of French language use in general in the classroom.  Her increased confidence will enable her to take on more of the language teaching in the upper school, freeing other members of the Modern languages team to work with class teachers on the introduction of the second modern language in the upper stages.  \r\n\r\nThe children will take part in researching the visit and preparing their representative to visit France and present their school to new people.  They will learn through new methods using current ideas and resources to further their knowledge of language and cultures beyond Scotland.   In the long term this will benefit the children as they see the relevance of learning languages in order to understand the world and play their part in modern Europe.  They will also get the chance to share their experiences with the local community through the blog and the French cafe run by senior pupils, with information they have gathered collected for presentation and display.  \r\n\r\nThe cluster of local primary schools will benefit through the strengthened link between primaries and the language department at the Academy and the new ideas shared between them.  This will smooth the transition from Primary to Secondary school as the staff and pupils will have more informed expectations of the levels of language learning and skills acquired at each stage.   \r\n\r\nThe approach is sustainable as we can use the resources from the immersion course to ensure we keep our knowledge up to date, choose a new focus area of France each year and seek to contact or twin with a school there through links established through this project.  Then we can use the methods we found most effective to share our findings with the whole school, parents, the community and beyond.  The format can also be applied to other European countries as we introduce the second modern language in the upper school giving breadth to the children's language learning.  The excitement of the relevant, current information and contexts for using languages will inspire the children and, we would hope, begin a love of languages which will last into their adult life.", null, "Pumpherston and Uphall Station Community Primary school", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002167_coordinator"]]}}}}
