Six of them are schools and 2 are associations.\r\nThe common context where our schools operate is characterized by the presence of students from social deprived background, SEN, immigrants and disabled, and with learning difficulties. We share the same interest for music: there are music courses and some students learn to play a musical instrument. We noticed that, not all students that wish to play, attend these courses, because there is a selection and buying an instrument is expensive. Moreover, the practice is often unsuitable for a student with physical disabilities. So a lot of students abandon their wish and lose their interest. We want to democratise the opportunity to play music, so that, the most part of our students could take advantage from it. We want to link together disabled, ordinary and talented individuals through the universal language of music and make them part of European inclusive communities.\r\nOur main objective is to instill in students the awareness of human diversity, cultural and linguistics through music as a teaching resource in everyday practices that brings together and builds an inclusive school and a respectful society with diversity. We want also to develop amongst all students, but in particular, those who are disabled or SEN, a sense of achievement and self worth; feel them part of an inclusive community; overcome prejudices against disability; enhance the quality of learning offer and foster equity and inclusion; enhance the ability to express themselves through music and the opportunity to experience the awe and wonder that immersion in such an art can bring to the soul. Playing music is one of the best means to achieve inclusion and a universal human activity a basic right for all.\r\nWe\u2019ll create a fairy tale about two boys searching rehabilitation, achieving fulfilment and succeeding in their lives. They start a trip through the different European countries and learn how people can succeed in life. They discover traditional music and rhythms, local languages, dances and musical instruments. At each step they do various experiences and meet different people: poor, immigrants, disabled, disadvantaged who in general are not considered but the two guys are able to see special gifts in them and, trusting them give a new birth to their hidden skills.\r\nAt the end of their trip the two guys will form a group of artists called \"The different colours of music\", who will have a big performance. Despite their  conditions, they\u2019ll understand how to use talents and how to give value to their abilities and be member of an inclusive society.\r\nThe activities will be done both locally and transnationally. The professional musicians will be responsible of composing songs and also of conducting workshops for students. Together they\u2019ll have rehearsals and public concerts until the last big exhibition of the fairy tale. The most important activities to be done during the 2 years of project are: identify nature sounds; know foreign partners instruments, songs, and dances; play using objects and recycled materials; express emotions through instruments; compose music using software; know how to make special instruments for disabled people. All activities will be made cooperatively and the products created sharing ideas. Each student will be protagonist of his own educative process.\r\nDuring and after our project, new skills and practices will be developed to create an inclusive society in which all individuals will play an active role for the future Europe. The participants will have the opportunity to meet different individuals with their needs and develop respect for each other, know foreign cultures and develop tolerance, acquire new enthusiasm towards music and  be able to express themselves through it, become more sensitive towards people with difficulties and finally understand that there are not people without abilities but just persons with different abilities.\r\nThe impact on all participants will be strong. Teachers will know and experience new methods, how to work with different students, and consequently, they\u2019ll improve their teaching skills, they\u2019ll create positive and easier learning settings. Being part of innovative strategies, students will gain extra motivation to learn not only music, but also all other subjects. They\u2019ll acquire competences in social life and improve key competences, enhance interdisciplinary skills and creative thinking. Schools will become more attractive for students and register lower rates of school early leaving. \r\nAll the participants will gain important abilities and this will continue lifelong.

Social Emotional Learning", "Denbigh Primary School", 125788.0, 7, 7, "Social and emotional learning has often been an umbrella term for a wide range of competencies from emotional intelligence to\r\nsocial competence to self-regulation.\r\nSEL competencies encompassthree areas:\r\nEmotional processes include understanding and labeling feelings accurately; regulating emotions and behaviors for the situation\r\n(e.g., calmly sorting through a disagreement rather than storming out of a faculty meeting when angry); taking another\u2019s perspective, and displaying empathy.\r\nSocial/interpersonal skills include understanding social cues (such as body language and tone of voice); correctly attributing the intent of others\u2019 behaviors (e.g., understanding a student\u2019s defiance as a desire for independence rather than a personal\r\ninsult); interacting positively with students and other adults, and acting in prosocial ways (e.g., offering help and kind words).\r\nCognitive regulation includes maintaining attention and focus; engaging working memory, inhibiting impulses that are not appropriate to the ededevelop SEL and build positive school culture have focused exclusively on students. Educators typically receive little training and support for implementation and for effectively supporting students\u2019 social and emotional development\r\nand even less training and support for implementationvand for effectively supporting students\u2019 social and emotional development\r\n\r\nTeachers\u2019 SEL competencies influence students in at least three ways:\r\nFirst, SEL influences the quality of teacher-student relationships.\r\nTeachers who are good at regulating their emotions are more likely to display positive affect and higher job satisfaction\r\nTeachers who are calm, positive, and content are likely to be better equipped to treat students warmly and sensitively, even when students behave in challenging ways.\r\nWhen students have high-quality relationships with teachers, they have better social adjustment and higher academic competence\r\nConversely, when teachers and students have negative or conflict-fi lled relationships, students are less likely to be engaged in school and more likely to have low academic achievement.\r\nSecond, teachers model SEL skills for students \u2014 intentionally or not. Teachers navigate stressful situations nearly every day, and\r\nstudents are watching. Studentsl earn from the way teachers manage frustration, maintain control of themselves and the classroom, stay focused in the face of distractions, and shift tactics when needed.\r\nThey also learn from the way teachers handle students who need better SEL skills, such as when students act cruelly toward one\r\nanother or use inappropriate language, such as \u201cthat\u2019s so gay.\u201d That is why  teachers need to possess certain \u201chabits of mind,\u201d\r\nor dispositions, such as awareness, attention, fl exibility, and intentionality.\r\nIt is also why one intervention program begins with activities to build school leaders\u2019 and teachers\u2019 SEL skills as a precursor to\r\nstudent programming \r\nThird, teachers\u2019 SEL abilities likely influence their classroom organization and management. As every teacher knows, maintaining\r\na calm, organized, and wellregulated environment is essential. Such environments include effective behavior management approaches as well as practices that encourage creativity, student choice and autonomy, and student reflection.\r\nTo build such environments, teachers must maintain a sense of calm, be organized, feel in control of the classroom, and develop social trust with students and families who may be different from them.\r\n\r\nOur project wants to create a culture of continuous improvement and learning for teachers and students:\r\n* Appropriately gathers information and formulates written assessments about individuals, families, groups or community situations\r\n* Able to make assessment of situation and prioritize interventions at the appropriate level and target group.\r\n* Conceptualizes and articulates the rationale and theoretical framework behind: assessment, choice of intervention strategies, techniques, and case plan implementation.\r\n* Opportunity to formulate plans & goals with groups that include cultural &/or ideological perspectives and to work with groups on the basis of mutually.\r\n* Opportunity to interview or interact groups, or staff who are from socio-cultural backgrounds different from the student.\r\n* Opportunity to communicate effectively, orally and in writing.\r\n* Evidences competence in: listening and attending; reflection and acceptance of feelings; paraphrasing and summarizing content; confrontation; recognition of strengths; incorporating cultural and/or ideological perspectives of clients, and reinforcing.\r\n\r\nSupport for SEL skills must be embedded into the daily life of the school for everyone: students, teachers and staff.This is essential because SEL skills are developed in and needed for everyday interactions.", "http://www.denbighprimary.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA219-035171_4"]]}}, "1RJ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1420070400000, 1483142400000, "PERvasive Serious GAMes suppOrted by Virtual CoachiNg", "Aisolve Limited", "PERGAMON aims to facilitate the matching between providers of innovative ICT technologies on the supply side and the creative industry operating in the field of serious games on the demand side.
