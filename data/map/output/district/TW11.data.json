Exceptions can be achieved eg. through polarization changes induced by magnetic fields (known as the Faraday effect) together with polarization-sensitive birefringent materials. However, light can also be influenced by the presence of a counterpropagating light wave. We have recently shown that this leads to the surprising consequence that light sent into tiny glass rings (microresonators) can only propagate in one direction, clockwise or counterclockwise, but not in both directions simultaneously. When sending exactly the same state of light (same power and polarization) into a microresonator, nonlinear interaction induces a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the propagation of light. In this proposal we plan to investigate the fundamental physics and a variety of ground-breaking applications of this effect. In one proposed application, this effect will be used for optical nonreciprocity and the realization of optical diodes in integrated photonic circuits that do not rely on magnetic fields (an important key element in integrated photonics).

Surprisingly, this question has only attracted limited attention in the past. However, the nonlinear interaction of counterpropagating light in resonators has fascinating implications. One effect that we recently discovered is the spontaneous symmetry breaking and optically induced nonreciprocity of counter-propagating optical modes. This symmetry breaking manifests itself in a remarkable effect: light of the same frequency and power can enter a microresonator in one direction but not in the other. The fundamental nature of such a broken symmetry could impact science far beyond optical physics. This proposal aims to exploit this discovery for novel types of photonic elements. Work package (A) addresses an urgently needed photonic element: the integrated optical diode (or isolator). Currently, such devices rely on magneto-optical effects that make it impossible to integrate them into chip-based photonic circuits. The use of Kerr-nonlinearity induced symmetry breaking in a simple microring resonator is a promising route towards a novel class of nonreciprocal integrated optical devices. Work package (B) addresses research on nonlinear-enhanced optical gyroscopes. Currently the best gyroscopes are based on ring lasers that cannot be further miniaturized because their sensitivity scales with their size. The symmetry breaking of counter-propagating light in a microresonator has the potential to overcome this limitation and to realize microphotonic gyroscopes with unprecedented sensitivities. The final work package (C) will investigate the nonlinear interaction of counter-propagating light for optical switching and optical memories.

This is an area where European industry is very strong, three European SMEs have a dominant role in production of such instruments.\nIn scratching a sharp, stiff tool is moved on the surface of the sample while a normal force is applied on the tool tip. At different threshold values of the force the tip penetrates into the sample by various mechanisms. These threshold forces, or more precisely the stresses that are generated at these thresholds, are characteristic parameters for the failure of the substrate-coating system in question.\nTest procedures and software for nano-scratching are in their infancy compared to those for nanoindentation. Development of nanoindentation equipment started on a firm theoretical basis, while nano-scratching (as macro-scratching) has no uniform methodology till now.\nOne part of the NANOINDENT FP-7 project (NMP3-CA-2008-218659) dealt with the development of nano-scratching metrology, guidelines for determining scratching data were constituted. Based on these studies, NANOINDENT partners have set up this new proposal to start a standardisation process. The overall aim of the project is to draft a New Working Item Proposal (NWIP) for a standard in nano-scratching that will be submitted to the appropriate CEN technical committee (TC 352) through a workshop of the main European stakeholders from industry, academia, and research organizations.", 50165.0, 411830.0, 6, 8, "NANOINDENT-plus", null, "http://www.npl.co.uk", null, "fp7_104815_999920330"], [1291161600000, 1385769600000, "European Research Infrastructures for Nuclear Data Applications", "Npl Management Limited", "Different concepts involving critical (fast) reactors or subcritical accelerator-driven systems are being studied in view of their transmutation capabilities. These design studies imply high demands on the underlying nuclear database. The need for improved nuclear data has been expressed in the Strategic Research Agenda of the SNE-TP ( Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform).\nThe accurate knowledge of neutron and proton induced nuclear reactions in the fast, intermediate- and high- energy domains (En = 1keV to 500 MeV) is of crucial importance for predicting the capabilities of reducing the inventory of plutonium, minor actinides, and long-lived fission products. In the past, this energy domain was not investigated with high priority because of minor importance for conventional light-water reactors. An additional challenge is the tightening demand on the accuracy of the data, especially for assessing criticality safety aspects and designing fuels for very high burn-up.\nThe ERINDA project aims for a coordination of European efforts to exploit up-to-date neutron beam technology for novel research on advanced concepts for nuclear fission reactors and the transmutation of radioactive waste.

SHOAL will develop a shoal of robotic fish to analyse contaminants in water and produce a real-time map of which pollutants are in the water, in what concentrations and where these are on a 3D map of the port.

But predominantly it enables higher energy conversion efficiency by ensuring that prime movers are effectively loaded at all times and across all operating conditions. This dominating advantage cannot be matched by mechanical transmission systems because gearboxes offer little chance of integrating a high number of prime movers in the restricted space of a ship whereas this integration is straight forward when managed electrically. Thus the electric ship concept offers reduced emissions through improved efficiency of engine operation but critically it offers significant reduced emissions during the critical phase of entry to littoral water when with speed generally reduced engines in a mechanical systems become very lightly loaded.\n\n\n\nIt is proposed to enhance the electric ship concept so it suits a wider range of vessels than currently. The principal barrier to adoption of the electric ship concept in merchant ships is the size of the equipment. However if size reductions can be achieved then adopting the electric ship concept in a wider range of merchant ships will, as described above, reduce emissions and improve the impact on global warming. Overall this impact will be significant given the current and anticipated levels of global trade and the proportion to be moved by sea transport.\n\n\n\nThis challenging ambition, to enable the adoption of the electric ship concept in a wider range of merchant ships, will demand the development of new technologies across all of marine electrical engineering:\n\n\n\n1.  High Temperature Superconductivity (HTS): This is a technology that allows smaller principal electrical components and an increase in efficiency.\n\n\n\n2.  Wireless monitoring:  This provides simpler internal control communication and enables the adoption of more advanced control regimes (as offered by the electrification of propulsion).\n\n\n\n3.  Harbour Shore Electrical Supplies: Running lightly loaded generators in harbour - as is commonly the practice among merchant ship operators - threatens the environment in a sensitive zone. The lack of any propulsion load prevents loading the generators more effectively. The answer is to supply the ship with electricity from shore connections. This does not need technological innovation but the widespread adoption of shore supplies demands standardisation among connectors and mode of electrical supply that has yet to be investigated.\n\n\n\n4.  Electrical actuation: This is a technology which aims to replace mechanically actuated auxiliaries by using direct electrical actuators and reduces size, cost, maintenance and improves efficiency\n\n\n\nThe benefits of these proposed innovations will be tested by developing designs for specific ship types: multi-purpose, cruise and container. The integration process will be composed of 6 steps:\n\n\n\n1  Ship mission\n\n\n\n2  Energy consumers\n\n\n\n3  Draft design\n\n\n\n4  Performance simulations\n\n\n\n5  Final design\n\n\n\n6  Environmental impact.\n\n\n\nTo reduce costs only the design for the multi-purpose ship will be taken through all the six steps.

In order to remedy this problem the proposed project 'FIREPROOF' would develop a very universally applicable regulatory framework for maritime fire safety based on probabilistic models and numerical models of ignition, growth and impact of fires. The framework would be quite similar in principle to the well established probabilistic damage stability regulation. The methodology of the proposed fire safety regulation is summarized as follows:  The methodology would consist of a mathematical model that would generate instances of fire  scenarios according to the correct probability distribution of the elements of the scenario.  It would also consist of numerical models to assess the consequence of the scenarios so generated.  For any given ship - traditional or novel, a large number of scenarios would be generated  and their consequences assessed, and the results would be aggregated to give rise to fire risk  metrics. Constraints based on such risk metrics would serve as statutory regulations that  would be completely applicable to novel and unprecedented designs. It would offer the designer  greater freedom on the design while enforcing a greater level of safety.'", 301437.0, 3568455.0, 8, 13, "FIREPROOF", null, null, null, "fp7_91166_999617108"], [1533081600000, 1627689600000, "Data Analytics, Data Sources, and Architecture for Upgraded European Customs Risk Management", "Bmt Group Ltd", "Security and fraud in cross-border trade and supply chains are key priorities for the EU customs administrations due to the increasing risk of transnational crime and terrorism and the e-commerce-driven growth of customs declarations.

There is a perception that they can achieve less than what they really can. Recent research and new opportunities for their integration in mainstream education and work provided numerous cases where levels of achievement exceeded the (limiting) expectations. Contrary to common belief, there is considerable variety and richness between individuals with DS. However, society tends to simplify their view of people with DS, usually in a way which is detrimental to them and in a way which reduces their chances to achieve their potential as citizens, despite having exactly the same rights than everybody else.<br/>POSEIDON aims at developing a technological infrastructure which can foster a growing number of services developed to help people with DS to become more integrated, to support their development as citizens and to enable them to make a greater contribution to society. There is a wide range of issues which can be tackled, we provide our contribution starting with a focus on supporting education, work, leisure and socialization.<br/>The infrastructure to be developed will provide a development environment which other organizations can use as a stepping stone to develop more new services for inclusion in the future. An outcome will be a working system with basic services to support inclusion which will illustrate the effectiveness and potential of our proposal. We are conscious that people with DS have their own strengths, preferences and needs so POSEIDON will focus on using their strengths to provide support for their needs whilst allowing each individual to personalize the solution based on their preferences.<br/>POSEIDON will be co-designed by final users.

Safety of workers with Down syndrome (SD) and more generally of  workers with intellectual disabilities is something even more specific and fundamental. Until now just some countries have already dealt with this subject and there are no European guidelines avaliable. This is the reason why the Italian Association of people with Down syndrome (AIPD), which has a long-time experience in the field of job placement of its members, has recognised the need to face such an issue. \r\nTwo UK associations made them available for an exchange of experience and a face to face training to AIPD staff. They are: the British Association of Supported Employment and The Down's Syndrome Association. They are disability associations and have specific experience in the field of  job placement. They have been selected among others because of their multiannual experience in dealing with safety at work for this pscific target of would - be workers. \r\n\r\nThus, if the general objective of the project is to increase job placement rate of people with DS, the specific purpose is the awareness raising and the acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes of 5 educators of AIPD staff about safety issues related to people with Down syndrome at work.  Two participants are part of the staff working at AIPD's headquarters (one belonging to the international relations office and one being the person in charge of all job placement actions within the association).
