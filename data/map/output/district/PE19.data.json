In this compound, an exchange of professional contents in the science area  of biotechnology and economical, political an ethical aspects. For many years living systems have been used for technical practice (e.g. brewing, microbiological waste water purification).  Only for a few decades the enormous potential  of biotechnology has been recognized. On a regular basis new applications and products are brought to the market. The awareness that, by transferring genetic material, interesting products can be \"manufactured\" in qualified production cells (e.g. human insulin, produced inside of bacteria), offers further possibilities. These genetic methods are equally admired as disregarded by the German society.\r\nMeasured by the actuality and daily-life relevance of biotechnology the demand of explanation about backgrounds, methods, chances and risks of biotechnology is not sufficient.. We, the student's lab \"teutolab-biotechnology\" plus six more international schools wish to change that, as students have to position themselves concerning this subject.\r\n\r\nFor one academic year, participating students work independently in national and international groups ( group puzzle) on interesting subjects on the area of  white (industrial biotechnology ), red (medical biotechnology) green ( plant biotechnology) and grey (environmental biotechnology) biotechnolgy. The student groups are connected via eTwinning and network their tasks.\r\nTransnational cooperation and exchange of experiences take place  at three conventions per academic year. The conventions are hosted by different countries in turns. Visiting biotechnological companies as well as the implementation of biotechnological experiments (e.g. in the student's lab teutolab-biotechnology or in the cooperating universities of foreign schools) are subject of the conventions just as reflection of bioethical questions.\r\nSo it is not only the theoretical learning of a subject, but also critical analysis occurs.  \" Education does not only mean knowledge and qualification, but also orientation and power of judgment.\" (former Federal President of Germany Horst K\u00f6hler, September 2006).\r\nDuring the third convention an exhibition will take place, where the linked students' findings will be presented to the general public. This exhibitions will also offer a platform for discussion with experts from science,  economy and politics.\r\n\r\nThe project clarifies and sensitizes and creates a regional conscience in biotechnology and  its main topic. Through points of contact, this raises students' and visitors' awareness for biotechnology in their region and generates interest for biotechnology as a whole. This interest will expand students' interest not only on a national level but also,  through the exchange, internationally. Knowledge acquired in this context will be expanded from local and regional over to the national and international level.\r\nThrough the acquisition of knowledge, the regional and cross-border network as well as the exchange imparts values which, due to contestation,  triggers the  acceptance of cultural way of thinking and statutory regulations. This leads to downsizing of fears and doubts and will be supported in discussions with the society ( from economy, science and politics).\r\n\r\nWe believe that many aspects of biotechnology will be carried forward into the future, preparing our students for  a rapidly changing world and workplace, alerting them to the fact that their local actions are important, and the fact that they too have a voice, and to the fact that many voices create a resounding echo.", "http://www.longsands.cambs.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE03-KA201-013568_3"], [2018, "Voor elkaar leren- Met elkaar leren", "St Neots Learning Partnership", 15012.0, 3, 3, "Learning from each other, learning with each other", "http://www.longsands.cambs.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL01-KA101-038838_2"], [2018, "Voneinander lernen - miteinander lernen", "St Neots Learning Partnership", 13960.0, 3, 3, "Learning from each other \u2013 learning with each other\r\n\r\nOur school intends to qualify a team of teachers that is responsible for the implementation and dissemination of successful concepts of European schools in the area of foreign language acquisition. \r\n\r\nSince international exchanges and foreign language acquisition form a core aspect of our school profile, it is the aim of our school to teach the students with the help of innovative and divers methods, motivating and encouraging them in the best possible way.\r\nMoreover, one of our key projects is to establish bilingual education in the near future as well as the further development of language learning with educated and skilled teachers as well as the maintenance of international contacts and partners. In order to realize these goals we need to educate more colleagues in bilingual language teaching.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to increase the motivation of our heterogenous students, we are very interested in the acquisition of new teaching methods, particularly focusing on CLIL. \r\nWe also need to broaden our range of material with regard to speaking incentives and motivating teaching methods concentrating on the individual learner.\r\nThe exchange with language teachers from English speaking countries and CLIL colleagues from other European countries will certainly increase our knowledge and experience as teachers. \r\nThe three participants should be motivated language teachers who are open to learn new methods and techniques. They should also have experience in the work with European partner schools and be interested in sharing their knowledge with colleagues. Moreover, the project is aimed at teachers with History, Geography or Biology as their second subjects, keeping the introduction of bilingual education in mind. They should also be willing to share acquired methods, material and experiences with other colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe project team plans Job Shadowing lessons and exchanges with two partner schools, one of them in London (England) and the other one in Haarleemermeer (The Netherlands), focusing on successful concepts, material and methods of foreign language acquisition. The team has also planned to invite experts as consultants and to learn about the latest status of research in this area of education. \r\n\r\nThe exchange with the partner schools will certainly improve our competences in language teaching. Teachers will be asked to reflect their behavior and to test the newly acquired methods and materials in their classes. These colleagues should be prepared to engage in intercultural exchange and to integrate the experiences made in their daily teaching. They should serve as role models for their students and thus increase their intercultural competences. \r\n\r\nThe participants are intended to spread their knowledge as multipliers offering Job Shadowing or training courses. \r\nUpon conclusion of the project, all participants and European partners will evaluate the whole process and the success of the project according to predefined criteria.

The main project objective is to test a certified, high performance, tidal flow technology ready for commercial deployment. The collaborative nature of this project has allowed a very strong team of partners to be assembled that has the necessary expertise to design, build, test and optimise the full scale demonstrator. The pre-production prototype to be demonstrated uses oscillating hydrofoils; this technology is currently being tested by Pulse Tidal in a scaled marine trial in the UK. Oscillating hydrofoils have been proposed previously for exploiting tidal currents. Pulse Tidal, the holder of the IPR, has an improved technical approach and a refined strategy, which exploits the benefits of oscillating foils over wind turbine style axial flow rotors. Modelling has shown that high efficiencies can be achieved from a hydrofoil oscillating at certain frequencies. Scaled model testing by Pulse Tidal has confirmed that a phased pair of hydrofoils sweeping the same cross section of flow improves power capture efficiency to a level comparable with axial flow systems. The hydrofoil approach allows power to be captured with a wide, shallow swept area. In a given depth oscillating foil systems can be up to four times more powerful than single axial flow rotors. In reality almost all sites are too shallow for multi-megawatt axial flow rotors. By offering much larger unit capacities Pulse will have a unique strategic and economic advantage over other technologies. Pulse Tidal\u2019s clear commercial focus is therefore to develop early systems specifically for tidal flows too shallow for others to compete.
