Fortunately this long-standing impossibility can be currently overcome by the complementary action of new experimental capacities and stronger simulations schemes which explicitly pay attention to the nanoscale.  Recent nanoindentation experiments have revealed that the C-S-H gel can present itself either in a low stiffness and low density variety (called LD C-S-H gel) or in a variety with a high stiffness and high density (called HD C-S-H gel). This dissimilar bearing capacity is indeed much more pronounced in their resistance to osteoporosis-like degradation processes (aging!). The question that arises is straightforward: Could the formation of the stronger and more durable HD C-S-H varieties be promoted against the LD- ones?  CODICE aims to answer to this question by means of on-top-of-the-art simulations. In fact CODICE project aims to develop a serial parameter-passing multi-scale modelling scheme to predict the structural evolution and the mechanical performance of non-degraded and degraded cementitious matrices as a function of macroscopical processing variables to guide the design of cementitious materials in which the HD-C-S-H forms are promoted against the LD- C-S-H ones.   Improvements of the mechanical properties about the 50 % and 600 % are envisaged for non-degraded and degraded cementitious scaffolds respectively, when compared to conventional designs.

The origins and aims of the EU are quite clear. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community were formed in 1951 and 1958, with the premise to create an ever closer union, and to avoid the conflicts that had devastated Europe during the preceding decades. Since the 1950s the EU has consistently grown in both size and operating remit, with the 1993 Maastricht Treaty establishing the current EU and creating a common citizenship. Yet it was at this point that established political parties began to be challenged within individual member states about their continued support for the EU.\r\n\r\nThe EU currently endures a period of existential angst. Central to the second of two priorities from the \u201cEurope for Citizens\u201d Work Programme is democratic engagement and civic participation; the EU Commission state: \u201cthere is a need to deepen further the discussion on the future of Europe on what kind of Europe citizens want, also stimulating new forms of civic participation whilst reinforcing those existing.\u201d Across Europe there is polarisation of views about many different issues with differences of opinion becoming increasingly intense and in some cases confrontational. It appears that underlying many of these issues are Europeans\u2019 conflicting views about the balance between national and European identity and values.  \r\n\r\nKwame Anthony Appiah (2016), an expert on the ethics of identity, argues that \u201cWe live in a world where the language of identity pervades both our public and our private lives.\u201d but he also stated that there are profound sources of confusion in our thinking about identities. The current proposal aims to develop an innovative online game, the RU EU? GAME, that aims to help young people across Europe to develop a better understanding of their own national and European identity and values, as well as those of others, to examine and reflect upon the impact of their own identity and values on their interactions with others, and to challenge them about their attitudes and prejudices in tackling problem solving tasks involving national and European identity. The game will provide opportunities for young Europeans to extend and test their knowledge of Europe; engage in discussions on a range of issues relevant to young Europeans; explore their identities; and solve problems collaboratively. \r\n\r\nThe project will be organised into 4 main phases: preparation, implementation, follow-up and closure. Phase 1 (preparation) covers design activities including a literature review focusing on national and European identity, a user requirements analysis for the game and the design specification for the game. Interviews, focus groups and questionnaires will be used in the user requirements analysis to assess what potential players of the game would like to see in the game. The key activities in Phase 2 (implementation) will be the development of the game and additional resources to support the game. Key activities in Phase 3 (follow up) will be the piloting and evaluation of the game, while phase 4 (closure) will address sustainability.  Dissemination activities will take place throughout the project to increase awareness of and interest in the game and to maximise impact. \r\n\r\n3 main groups of Higher Education students will be targeted by the game. Firstly social science and business students will take part. It is argued that developing a deeper understanding of European identity and values is core learning for these students. Two other groups of students will also be targeted by the game: the game will help Erasmus students to maximise their experiences of studying abroad by developing a better understanding of national and European identity.  In addition students who, for whatever reason, cannot take part in the Erasmus mobility scheme will be included.

Between one third and a half of people living with dementia in Europe do so in resource-intensive facilities (e.g. nursing homes and hospitals), although the policy imperative is to shift the balance of care through family caring. The known variation in the quality of dementia care across Europe, (which ranges from impoverished care to high quality care) represents a major health care inequality.  For these reasons the European Parliament recently highlighted the need for common guidelines to inform the training of practitioners and others involved in caring for persons with dementia.  The 2013 G8 Dementia Summit additionally called for shared solutions to workforce development across the care continuum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe middle to late stages of the disease (advanced dementia), may last up to 10 years. This stage is particularly challenging due to the complexity of the condition. A serious qualified dementia workforce challenge is a legacy of under investment in post registration education and a lack of leadership development coupled with the low status of dementia careers.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the dementia Palliare project is to create an inspirational experiential interprofessional learning solution to equip the European qualified dementia  workforce to lead and champion practice reform.  The first stage of the project will culminate in the co-production of an evidence based European Best Practice Statement defining the extended palliative phase of dementia and the principles underpinning best practice. An interprofessional education gap analysis will examine what is required to equip the qualified dementia workforce to deliver best practice. The second implementation phase of the project will see the development and piloting of an innovative virtual interprofessional experiential learning solution including an international virtual community of practice and validated modules in a range of languages. The specific objectives and outcomes are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 1 Objective: An inter professional understanding of best practice for advanced dementia care and family caring during the extended palliative care stage of  the illness, and an understanding of the contribution of different disciplines to the achievement of best practice.    \r\n\r\nOutcomes:\r\n\r\n1.1) An interrogative literature review of dementia care and family caring associated with the extended palliative phase of the illness.\r\n\r\n1.2) A comparative documentary analysis of policy  across partner countries. \r\n\r\n1.3) Comparative case studies from the partner countries illustrating the experience of extended palliative care phase of dementia from the perspective of the individual with dementia and family caring. \r\n\r\n1.4)  An agreed European Best Practice Statement. \r\n\r\n1.5) An interprofessional education gap analysis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 2 Objective:  Develop an innovative virtual interprofessional experiential learning solution to equip the European qualified dementia workforce to transform advanced dementia care and deliver best practice.  \r\n\r\nOutcomes:\r\n\r\n2.1)  A learning and facilitation framework based on a pedagogical a review of virtual experiential learning and facilitation methods and interventions.  \r\n\r\n2.2)  A shared online collaborative learning environment .\r\n\r\n2.3)  Interprofessional module materials (e.g. CoP practice improvement and values reconcilitation methodology and modules on Advance Dementia Care Interventions) at undergraduate and post graduate levels in a range of European languages.     \r\n\r\n2.4)  An experiential learning facilitator manual and student handbook in a range of European languages.\r\n\r\n2.5) An inaugural European faculty comprising academics and practitioners from partner countries, with experiential learning facilitation capabilities.\r\n\r\n2.6) A development plan for a sustainable  virtual European Dementia Academy based on the project outputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo deliver the project ambition we have assembled a seven country partnership comprising multi-professional leaders with combined expertise in experiential practice based learning and dementia care.

To maximise their potential young people should start thinking about their future career at a young age. However many young people do not engage in career planning and personal development planning and lack aspirations, attitudes and confidence with respect to future careers. \r\n\r\nOver the last ten years there has been an upsurge of interest in using digital games for learning and attitude and behaviour change. This has emerged from optimism that the motivating features of entertainment games could also be deployed to motivate learning. However, games also offer methods of learning that are highly consistent with modern theories of effective learning, which propose that learning activities should be active, situated, problem based, interactive and socially mediated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAims and objectives of the project: The aim of the current proposal is to develop a game-based approach to supporting awareness raising and behaviour change in the area of youth employability and career management. A game could provide an active, decision-making approach to supporting young people in thinking about employability and self-development by using motivational game mechanics that can induce in the users a sense of fun and self-actualisation patterns that will be helpful in raising awareness of issues. It seems likely that, as \u201cdigital natives\u201d who have been brought up with digital technology, young people would find a game-based approach to employability and careers highly attractive.  \r\n\r\nThe YESGAME fits well with current thinking about employability and careers, putting the student at the centre of their career decisions. The YESGAME will be built around 4 key features that young people need to be aware of in thinking about their careers: self, strengths, horizons and networks (Scottish Government, 2012). The aim of the game is to make young people more aware that taking personal responsibility for planning their own career and having realistic goals is more likely to help them achieve satisfaction in their career. The game should also allow young people to realise that their future career prospects are not fixed and that some factors that impact on their employability are more broad-ranging and flexible than they might realise. The YESGAME will be a role-playing game where an in-game character has the opportunity to take part in a series of activities which will provide \u201cexperiences\u201d, mini-games or \u201cchallenges\u201d requiring a series of choices. \r\n\r\nDuring the design phase of the project, tasks will include a literature review of career management and decision-making resources; a review of existing digital employability and careers guidance resources; a user requirements analysis and design specification. Key activities during the implementation stage will be the development of the YESGAME and additional resources to support the game, such as a pedagogical guide and videos. Piloting of early prototypes of the game will determine the acceptability and usability of the game with a small number of end users of the game. In addition a larger scale evaluation will be carried out on the final version of the game to establish the value and effectiveness of the game in interesting and supporting young people in career management activities. Best practice case studies and use case scenarios will provide further guidance about how best to use the game with different groups of young people. A range of dissemination activities to increase awareness and interest in the game amongst key stakeholders and interested parties, will be carried out during the project: a project Web site will be established; newsletters will be distributed, dissemination events will be held for employability and careers guidance practitioners and refereed academic & professional papers will be written. \r\n\r\nGame design, development and evaluation will be an iterative process. User requirements and design specification will use a negotiation-centric user-led design process. Results of piloting of early game prototypes with a small number of end users will feed into the refinement of the final game. A larger scale evaluation of the final version of the game will establish the value and effectiveness of the game in interesting and supporting young people in career management activities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the YESGAME will contribute to enhanced potential for career management skills, with young people taking more responsibility for planning their own career and having aspirational but realistic career goals. This will not just help them to achieve more satisfaction in their career. It could potentially increase their career mobility and resilience in the global employment market and make a significant contribution to the future of the youth and thus the European economy.", "http://www.uws.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF SCOTLAND", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA200-001858_coordinator"], [2017, "Using a GAmes approach to TEach children about discriminatory BULLying", "UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF SCOTLAND", 215252.0, 4, 4, "Europe is currently at a crossroad, facing multiple challenges such as an economic and fiscal crisis, a migration crisis, terrorist attacks and the rise of political far-right ideology. According to the latest report of the Council of Europe\u2019s Commission against Racism and Intolerance, these changes have resulted in a growing climate of racism, Islamophobia, homophobia and intolerance that filters down to the younger generations. For example, racism and religious discrimination was voted as the number one issue of concern among young people in the UK in 2016 (British Youth Council, 2016). Especially among young children, discrimination is frequently expressed in the form of bullying. A recent pan-European survey found that 46% of school students had observed bullying acts directed towards immigrant/Roma students in the last three months (Elame, 2013). However, the same survey also confirmed that there is no evidence-based educational approach for discriminatory bullying currently in Europe. This is a huge gap considering that prejudice-reduction initiatives have most potential to be successful with young children. \r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, this project will develop an innovative approach to tackling discriminatory bullying that integrates a serious digital game with an intercultural pedagogy and curriculum. The approach will consist of two elements: First, the project will develop an immersive 3D virtual environment, built on gaming architecture and driven by emotional AI, to provide a safe environment where school children can develop inter-cultural and social competencies by interacting with NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in a simulation of real world discriminatory bullying scenarios. Students will engage with simulations and be required to navigate their way through choices to arrive at the best solution. Second, the project will develop a complementary inter-cultural pedagogy and curriculum for use by the teachers who will implement the e-learning component in class.  \r\n\r\nThe project aims to train 50 teachers to use the e-learning component (i.e. serious game) and carry out a large-scale European pilot with 500 children aged 10-12 using the new serious game and curriculum in four countries: the UK, the Netherlands, Greece and Slovakia. \r\n\r\nThe project is intended to contribute towards the development of more cooperative practices in school, increase awareness about the plight of groups who are subject to discriminatory bullying in schools, and improve attitudes towards outgroups such as Roma children and migrants. Through interaction with a serious digital game children will develop their digital literacies. The project will also provide opportunities for teachers to be trained on the use of simulated e-learning technologies thus leading to a more highly skilled educational workforce.\r\n\r\nAt a national and European level the project is intended to raise awareness about discriminatory bullying and its effects and increase knowledge about the advantages of using simulated learning environments to teach about sensitive topics.", "http://www.uws.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF SCOTLAND", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036611_coordinator"], [2016, "Designing Collaborative Educational Resources (COERS) for Assets-Based Community Participation (ABCP) across Europe", "UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF SCOTLAND", 206242.0, 5, 5, "In spite of general declines in levels of youth crime across Europe, it has been found that local people living in deprived, densely populated urban areas are more likely to have high perceptions of youth disorder and to view young people\u2019s behaviour as problematic. Further, evidence suggests that relationships between young people living in socially deprived communities and other local residents are often fraught with mutual distrust and stereotyping. Building on the Strength-Based Approach used in social work, the principles associated with Assets-Based Community Development rely on true empowerment of local residents and community groups while significantly adjusting the mind-sets of service providers to create an equilibrium of understanding and avoid a deficit view of young people and disadvantaged communities.The project aims to design collaborative open educational resources in the form of innovative inter-professional educational resources to enable professionals and practitioners to implement an assets-based approach to foster inter-agency and inter-generational connectivity. In turn, these approaches will nurture and mobilise existing community assets and encourage pioneering collaborative approaches towards enhancing local community participation in order to enhance the protective factors that can both prevent youth disorder and crime and reduce negative public perceptions about young people.

The pervasive natureof intellectual disabilities and developmental disabilities, creates very high levels of need for assistance often throughout everyaspect of the individual's existence and over the whole of the person's life, especially by experts, therapists, educators andcaretakers. Traditional patterns of care have been heavily based on institutions, which tend to segregate and isolate people from themainstream of society and many European countries are now beginning to replace these with more individualised, integratedservices which aim to support inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities in society (Mansell & Ericsson, 1996). Moreover,importance of health & social services is increasing as unemployment and relocation across Europe increases. This growing demandfor services in many Member States is creating unprecedented pressures on special education systems. Despite differences inpolitical approaches and institutional frameworks, special education in all Member States faces similar challenges in adjusting tosocietal changes, rising expectations and consumerism, changing employment and family patterns, evolving technologicalopportunities and funding issues. In addition to being an important source of job creation (in excess of 20 million employees), thespecial education sector has an important economic weight.A recent report by the Social Protection Committee on the social dimension in the EU2020 strategy stated that greater emphasismust be spent on generating an effective and innovative way of developing the human capital of those responsible for improvingthe quality of life for vulnerable people throughout Europe. Education and training plays a pivotal role in developing those whowork with people with disabilities and, more generally, the special education sector. In many parts of Europe, the sector has a strongemphasis on learning and assessing skills for job roles in real practice environments (\"practice learning\"). In some qualifications,practice learning can be almost 40% of the total learning time. There are also on-going demands for practice learning with newqualified professionals. There are clear logistical challenges in arranging practice opportunities where trainees are able to learn thecore skills of the job and receive high quality support, supervision and assessment of their practice from suitably qualified mentors/practice assessors. Furthermore, finding sufficient numbers of such placements has been a challenge for the last 30 years. However,there are also other challenges; e.g. risks associated with work-based learning and the safety and well-being of service users in givingtrainees access to their lives. Last but not least, the financial situation in many European countries has lead many families to cutdown the private therapies of family members with intellectual disabilities due to financial benefits reduction.To address these challenges, the Play2Do project will develop an immersive 3D virtual environment, built on gaming architectureand driven by emotional Artificial Intelligence (AI), to provide a safe and readily accessible environment where VET/school students with intellectual disabilities can learn by interacting with NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in a simulation of a real world service.

They have a parent who has the hereditary, neurodegenerative disease - Huntington's disease (HD). Many children growing up with a sick parent take a lot of responsibility to take care of their parent.  At the same time they have 50% risk of having inherited the disease themselves. Shame, guilt and denial are very common phenomena  in HD families.  A lot of those affected by the disease feel very alone. The goals of the camp will be to improve knowledge, develop skills, gain empowerment, create support and being together a cultural exchange. During the camp the participants will have the opportunity to get in touch with other young people in the same situation.  They will, through good information, activities and discussions, get a better understanding of many of the aspects and emotional reactions to HD.  In the program there will be a focus on team-building to ensure that the participants establish best possible relations with each other so they can seek support and understanding during and after the camp. 39 Young people and 6 young adult volunteers from United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and Norway will be together with 5 staff leaders for 5 days.  The camp will be held in Grosvenor Hall, Kent, England.  The camp program will be a mix of teambuilding activities, workshops, information, group discussions cultural activities and leisure activities. We expect the camp to have a powerful impact on the lives of these young people and long-term we feel camp will enable these young people to believe in themselves, overcome the barrier of HD in their lives and achieve the goals they set themselves (whether that be educational, career or life achievements) - we want them to aim high. It is not uncommon to see a change in attitudes from participants on their future path in a positive way and that is our long-term goal for camp participants.", "http://www.hdscotland.org", "Huntington's Disease Youth Organisation", "erasmus_2015-3-UK01-KA105-022864_8"]]}}, "2HL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Language Training", "Castlehead High School", 3207.0, 1, 1, "The LFEE Immersion course has been identified as an area for continuous professional development for the specified member of staff at Castlehead High School. The course will enable the member of staff to refresh and update her own linguistic skills and competence in Spanish as well as her abilities in the methodology of teaching and learning of a foreign language. These skills can then be shared with the rest of the Modern Languages department, at whole school level and with the associated Primary schools. In terms of the school's curriculum development for the future, it is hoped to build upon the current existing pilot project in Spanish and ultimately offer Spanish as an area of study alongside French and German. It is therefore necessary that the specified member of staff completes the immersion course as part of her training in Spanish as this will allow for a fully qualified member of staff to develop and deliver up to date courses in the Spanish language. These courses can also be delivered to primary colleagues who wish to develop their Spanish skills and possibly offer Spanish as Language 3 in Primary 6 and 7 as per the Government's 1+2 strategy, which will not only benefit primary colleagues but will strengthen links between the primary and secondary schools and benefit pupils in terms of ease of transition. The Modern Languages department will also benefit greatly, as participation in this course will enable the staff members to help raise the profile of languages within the school, as well as helping to increase awareness of global citizenship through established relationships with European colleagues. In addition to benefiting the department, school and Learning Community, there will also be increased advantages for the pupils. Increasing the skill set of the specified staff member will hopefully result in a wider variety of courses being on offer in the school, and the pupils will benefit from the new ideas, resources and teaching methodology being applied in the classroom. Strengthening links with colleagues in Europe will allow for the building of partnership projects between schools, and will also be advantageous to pupils as they will experience language learning in a realistic context. Overall, participation in the immersion course will be hugely beneficial, not only for the participants, but for the department, whole school and wider Learning Community.", null, "Castlehead High School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035498_coordinator"]]}}}}
