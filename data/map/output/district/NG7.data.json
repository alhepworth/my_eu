Within this project the consortium will enhance the quality of education by training teachers in-service in the important field of digital literacy, that is now considered a weak point in the in service training systems of our partner countries. So our target group it is formed by primary, secondary and high school teacher, coadiuvated by school managers and decision takers.  Additionally, the project results and outcomes, especially the model of in-service training that we plan to create, will contribute to support continuous training of teachers and trainers. \r\n\r\nIn practical term we will create:  1 A model of in-service training - ( starting from a previous outcome of a Comenius Regio project ). The model will be adapted to local contexts and once finished will be the base for the further outcomes of the project. \r\n\r\n                                                               2 A manual on teacher training in digital literacy - that encompasses all the modules already produced and tested with teachers in each partner country.   The testing of the modules will be done contextually with their optimization in each partner country, thanks to real in-service training courses that will serve both as test both to improve the quality of the modules themselves.\r\n\r\n Cooperation and exchange of good practice in a considerable range of areas related to teachers\u2019 in-service training will be established. Thus the project makes a contribution to the adaptation of teaching and learning to a rapidly changing world, supporting new forms of teacher training.\r\n Appropriate quality assurance accompanies the process of the development of the envisaged project outcomes. Examples of good practice will likewise be shared. Reflection on well-being in the school will be thus engaged.\r\n\r\nA framework will be established to improve key competences in teachers in-service. Their digital competence will be increased considerably and their collaborative competences will be extended with regard to their learners, their families and the outside world.\r\nAs the training focuses on ICT-based contents rather than the operation of technology alone, cultural awareness and expression of the target group will be fostered. Communication will be a core element of the project outcome, the training modules, referring to communicative ICT-based competences as well as communication between various entities of society and teachers as well as their administration. Communication will be realised and enhanced in participants\u2019 mother tongues and in English as the working language of the project. Didactic elements of learning to learn will be incorporated in the test phase with the pilot material.\r\nThe target group we want to reach is formed by at least 500 people  considering all the partners. These individuals will act as multiplier as they will embody the spirit of the project and its innovation. Taking in consideration the robust dissemination and exploitation plan, the final number of reached and interested people will be much higher. \r\n\r\nAll of these aspects of the project reflect EU and national priorities for improvements in the education sector, and the priorities identified in the progress towards Europe 2020  by all member states.", "http://www.ivj.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-TR01-KA202-022342_2"], [2014, "Banana STEMS", "INSPIRATIONAL VOLUNTEER JOURNEYS COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 94707.0, 1, 1, "Project aimsThis project aims to tackle unemployment amongst young people with fewer opportunities living or working in rural areas in the EU OCT\u2019s and partner countries. It seeks to improve the economic power of young people, particularly young women, who want a career or small business in the agricultural and environment. This is achieved through increased competencies in the STEM subjects and developing leadership, entrepreneurship, global education and business skills. The project will develop active citizenship amongst participants around the topic of climate change, develop employability skills and facilitate new business creation in the agricultural sector.Project objectivesBy the end of the project 1. A demonstration Fairtrade Banana Farm in SVG run by young women under 30 years old will be established2. 12 structured group visits by schools, colleges and professionals to the demonstration site will take place3. 80 young people from the OCT\u2019s will have a better understanding of the links between agriculture and food engineering and how the STEM subjects apply 4. 60 young people will take part in a leadership and business enterprise programme. 5. 20 young people will develop business plans around their own ideas creating options for self-employment 6. A mobile application for banana farming is developed and piloted on 40 farms across 4 islands. At least one team of 8 young people will work together to design the app 7. 8 young people will volunteer on the demonstration farm 4 young people will volunteer in Turkey 8. 50 youth workers from the UK, French and Dutch OCT\u2019s will be trained to deliver the Banana STEMS learning programme 9. 10 young women will be supported to establish their own small holdings or agriculture related business 10. 3 large scale events in SVG, French Guiana and will take place to disseminate results", "http://www.ivj.org.uk", "INSPIRATIONAL VOLUNTEER JOURNEYS COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", "erasmus_554552-EPP-1-2014-1-UK-EPPKA2-CBY-ACPALA_coordinator"], [2016, "Seeds of Change", "INSPIRATIONAL VOLUNTEER JOURNEYS", 43864.0, 4, 4, "Following the volcanic eruptions 20 years ago, Montserratians were forced to migrate, mainly to the UK.  The population dropped from 12,000 to just 2,000 in 2001. Following the earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, Haitians were forced to migrate and many have settled in Montserrat. In addition poverty has forced people from the Domincan Republic to migrate. As a result of the outward and inward migration less than half of the current population in Montserrat, 5000 people, are indigenous Montserratian. This has given rise to a lack of tolerance, exclusion and discrimination against migrant communities. \r\n\r\nIn Montserrat young migrants do not drop out of formal education - they are pushed out. At the end of the autumn term of the exam year every student is assessed. If after assessment the teachers conclude that the student will not pass the exams with a good grade, they do not enter them for the exams at all. This means that the pass rates look very good but as many as 25% of young people leave school with no qualifications at all. These failure rates are significantly higher for French and Spanish speaking youth who have migrated from Haiti and the Dominican Republic to escape environmental disasters, poverty and oppression. There is only one VET College on the island. If you can't get into it because you don't speak English and/or you have no exam passes there is nowhere else to go for learning. A a result, young migrants suffer low self-confidence and self-esteem leading to feelings of depression. There is also tension between the immigrant and the host communities as they compete for low skilled jobs, suffer long periods of unemployment and work for extremely low wages. \r\n\r\nThe aims and objectives of this project are to \r\n1. Empower young people NEET by building self confidence and self esteem through non-formal learning activities\r\n2. Promote tolerance, equity and inclusion between communities \r\n3. Build the capacity of the partners to develop youth led initiatives that promote active citizenship\r\n4. Create a youth-led multi-lingual and multi cultural space for non-formal learning and a source of information about learning opportunities across Europe  \r\n\r\nThe ultimate aim is to improve the level of key competences and skills of young people, especially those with fewer opportunities as a result of being excluded from the benefits of the formal education system. This will be achieved through hosting 4 EVS volunteers to strengthen the capacity of an informal group of young people by supporting them to convert a disused campsite into a multi-cultural learning space where young people can come together to pursue their own interests and ideas. The weekly programme of activities that they will then provide will to promote active citizenship, inter-cultural dialogue, language skills, social inclusion and solidarity on the island. \r\nThe project also includes a youth exchange for  young people with fewer opportunities. The purpose of the youth exchange is to create an opportunity for inter-cultural dialogue on the impact of forced migration as a result of environment disasters. The partners seek to gain a greater understanding of the power of non-formal learning, its interconnectedness with vocational education and its potential to bring young migrants NEET closer to the labour market. \r\n\r\n \r\nBy the end of the project    \r\n1. 28 young people NEET will demonstrate increased levels of self confidence and self esteem after the non-formal learning programme \r\n2.

They supplement social security benefits through seasonal labour on farms and fishing vessels.  \r\n\r\nDue to the impact of both natural and man-made environment disasters, opportunities for youth employment on farms and fishing vessels is now also in decline. The volcanic eruptions in 1995 laid to waste the most fertile lands on the island which now lie in the exclusion zone. Acid rain caused by the sulpher clouds from the volcano reduces crop yields by up to 90%. Although greenhouses are available there is a lack of knowledge about pollination and irrigation techniques for farming in controlled environments.  \r\n\r\nAt the same time as agriculture is facing challenges, the nations fisheries are also under attack. Lionfish, an invasive species with no natural predators in this part of the world and with the capacity to reproduce all year round, have devoured native species to such an extent that catches of other more marketable species are lower and fishing as a sub-income becomes less viable. With the opportunities for casual labour becoming more scarce, young people in the remote villages are faced with two broad options; \r\na)to farm and fish illegally, planting marijuana and catching turtles which are protected species - selling the drugs, meat and eggs on the black market\r\nb) to migrate to mainland UK for better education and work opportunities. \r\nThe aim of the project is to enable youth in the farming and fishing villages in Montserrat to learn how young people in other parts of Europe re tackling these problems.

Empower young people NEET by building self confidence and self esteem through non-formal learning activities\r\n2. Promote tolerance, equity and inclusion between communities \r\n3. Build the capacity of the partners to develop youth led initiatives that promote active citizenship\r\n4. Create a youth-led multi-lingual and multi cultural space for non-formal learning and a source of information about learning opportunities across Europe  \r\n\r\nThe ultimate aim is to improve the level of key competences and skills of young people, especially those with fewer opportunities as a result of being excluded from the benefits of the formal education system. This will be achieved through hosting 2 EVS volunteers to strengthen the capacity of an informal group of young people by supporting them to convert a disused campsite into a multi-cultural learning space where young people can come together to pursue their own interests and ideas. The weekly programme of activities that they will then provide will to promote active citizenship, inter-cultural dialogue, language skills, social inclusion and solidarity on the island. \r\nThe project also includes a youth exchange for 25 young people with fewer opportunities. The purpose of the youth exchange is to create an opportunity for inter-cultural dialogue on the impact of forced migration as a result of environment disasters. The partners seek to gain a greater understanding of the power of non-formal learning, its interconnectedness with vocational education and its potential to bring young migrants NEET closer to the labour market. \r\n\r\n \r\nBy the end of the project    \r\n1. 10 young people NEET will demonstrate increased levels of self confidence and self esteem after the non-formal learning programme \r\n2. The leadership capacity of the youth led networks/organisations  that have initiated this exchange, will be strengthened\r\n3. A Lionfishing competition will be organised to develop teamwork, leadership and entrepreneurial skills \r\n4. 10 young people will learn about climate change and sustainability  \r\n5. 10 Young people will increase their knowledge about Erasmus+ and the European project\r\n6. 10 young people will achieve the Youthpass certificate\r\n7.  10 young people will learn about crowdfunding as a means to raise capital for their own projects\r\n8. 4 organisations/youth networks will gain more experience of organising youth exchanges and be in a stronger position to design more attractive programmes and activities for their target groups through being able to offer international mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the long term the project seeks to make peer-led youth work initiatives more effective and attractive to NEETs through increased learning mobility opportunities. The project aims to address the specific barriers of low self-confidence and low self-esteem as well as the economic or geographical obstacles to young peoples' full inclusion in society and the labour market. The project evaluation will measure the extent to which motivation to take part in future education or training programmes is increased within 6 months of the mobility activities.

When everyone works together, we can make the best use of our planet`s natural resources. When you recycle the products you use every day, like cardboard boxes, milk jugs, and soda cans, you give new life to items that used to be thrown away, you save energy and help lower greenhouse gas emissions in the process.

Youngsters will make \"a cleaning day\" and using materials that should be recycled like plastic bottles, plastic bags, leaves, branches of trees will make a creative exhibition of sculptures, using art and creativity, also making clothes. The exhibition will be open for public on the last day when participants will present the idea of selective garbage removal and recycling in order to save the environment. During this exhibition youngsters will hear about Erasmus+ opportunities and be motivated to take active part in their communities.

Participation contain a large meaning, because it means active participation, to give a contribute to the local community, to be part of it in share experience, knowledge, but also to help the community on its \"grow up\" way, but it means also to use the opportunity, to learn how to be part of EU, to interact with different cultures, to use non formal education. Behaviour means to learn more about the environment and to learn how to manage the relationship with it, to protect it and to use art and creativity as tool to \"use\" better the environment.We will prepare posters promoting our fashion show and cultural evenings- all these events will be open for local community of Montserrat. What's more we will create a group and events on Facebook, to make our communication with participants easier and to inform society of Montserrat better.

In order for pupils to be effective and successful European and global  citizens they need to be able to communicate with confidence.   \r\nThe project will focus on improving the attainment of all pupils who are not reaching expected levels in multi-literacy . This has been identified as an area of concern in both schools. The ability to speak, listen and communicate through different media is an essential skill for all pupils to have. It has been identified in each school that pupils cannot achieve the best in basic reading and writing unless they are confident speakers and communicators. This project will enable and encourage all pupils and teachers to investigate different ways of communicating their ideas, thoughts and opinions using both verbal and non-verbal techniques and strategies.  \r\n\r\nThis area  has emerged from our current Comenius project. The Erasmus+ Partnership opportunity enables us to jointly explore these issues and deepen our practice further . Pupils must be able to communicate, discuss and debate beyond the comfort zone of their own classroom. They need to be flexible communicators, have the ability to adapt and empathize across both local and European/Global contexts. Working with the partner schools in Europe provides us with the opportunities to develop global dialogues where a deeper understanding of each other\u2019s cultures, perspectives and opinions takes place. \r\n\r\n The project, 'Pupil Voice' will look collectively at the Big Question 'What Kind of a World would we like to live in? \r\nEach year one theme will be explored, taken from the Pupil Charter that was developed by the schools in the previous Comenius partnership which ends in August 2014. Due to the global themes the students have identified, the project will give all participants an enhanced sense of their ability to affect change on an individual and collective level. \r\nThe two themes selected from the Pupil Charter are\r\n\r\nGreed and Power\r\nEquality and Racism\r\n\r\nThere will be 6 transnational project meetings where senior managers, coordinators and teachers appointed to each schools Erasmus Team will work together on project planning, implementation and continual review and reflection.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole two years classes in both schools will work jointly and independently on the two themes. This will involve Skype, email, video conferencing and letter writing. Both schools will hold events, special days and ongoing classroom activities linked to the Erasmus themes. \r\n\r\nMany pupils in our schools will have little or no opportunity to ever take part in European travel. The project will see two 'Pupil Camps', one in Finland during winter and one in the UK. Pupils from both schools will take part and live together in a neutral venue for one week. Both Pupil Camps will be facilitated by a Theatre and Drama specialist who specializes in Ensemble Theatre, a style of theatre which involves communities working together in an equitable way which engages all participants  voice.\r\nShe will work with the camp participants on the process of creating a performance that responds to the theme that is being explored.  During this week they will explore the range of strategies for engaging Pupil Voice and will look at a Big Question the project has developed over the previous months. These pupils (and staff) will develop close and long standing relationships with each other and will be able to address some of the key issues identified through the months prior to the camp. The host pupils will be engaging in an opportunity they will probably never get in their lives again (low socioeconomic backgrounds).\r\nA specialist Media Artist will also attend both pupil camps to  film and document all the activities, process and outcomes. The film will be  edited professionally, capturing the whole experience, as well as the final outcome and this will become an essential dissemination tool .This film will be used by many key stake holders to disseminate the project, it's methodologies, results and impact.\r\n\r\nImprovement of the curriculum in both schools provides another rationale for the project. Both schools have identified the need to improve their way of engaging Pupil Voice and are keen to explore together the different strategies each school currently uses. The legacy of the project will be a refined and tested way of engaging Pupil Voice which both schools can integrate into their own curriculum. This will be disseminated in many ways including a project website, Erasmus+ Dissemination Platform, E-twinning, leaflets, brochures, seminars and sharing/training events , both internal and external.", "http://www.dunkirkprimary.com", "Dunkirk Primary and Nursery School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000210_coordinator"], [2017, "How do we create communities that are physically, emotionally and spiritually healthy?", "Dunkirk Primary and Nursery School", 29830.0, 2, 2, "How do we create communities that are physically, emotionally and spiritually healthy?\r\nThis question has arisen for both schools due to a number of changes.\r\nThere are concerns about how pupils who arrive from other countries with little or no English/Finnish settle happily into life at school and how easily they can access the curriculum. The need to welcome these new arrivals (some who have come from traumatic backgrounds and circumstances) is a key concern for both schools. Pupils and teachers need to develop the skills to become effective and empathetic European/Global citizens where all members of the school (and wider) communities feel happy,  safe and able to fulfill their full potential. This identified need has emerged from the political developments in both countries regarding the intake/treatment of migrants and refugees. In both communities there have been significant issues raised about how we should behave when welcoming new members to our community. The need for the whole community to develop certain skills has become evident. These skills include Empathy, Gratitude, Resilience, Social Responsibility and Self Care. This all feeds into the need to have a robust PSHE (Personal, Social, Health and Emotional) curriculum that isn't squeezed out due to external pressures and time.\r\nThe main objective of the project is to develop a Scheme of Work for PSHE that can be used internationally and speaks to all teachers easily. It should meet any school's individual needs but also be something that can be applicable on a global/international level. During the two years of the project, teachers will pair up with a teacher in the link school and work for a period of time together on developing ideas that they will trial and test with their classes. The Erasmus +  provides the ideal platform to address identified needs in both schools and supports collaborative action. This will provide a structure for both schools from which to work and will build upon the existing excellent relationship  between both schools. Having dialogue and discussion between teachers in both schools, sharing their strengths, skills, contexts and expertise provides an excellent platform from which to plan and implement the program.\r\nThe need to raise the self esteem of all pupils is a key area to develop. Developing the understanding, respect and tolerance between the different cultures and religions represented in both school communities is a big part of the project . Improving community cohesion and tolerance is something that will underpin the work of the next two years. \r\nThe ideas will center around developing Acts of Kindness across both schools. The aim will be to create kinder more empathetic communities.\r\nOver the two years 12 teachers and 3 leaders from each school will participate in a visit to the link school and their classes will link with each other sharing and collaborating throughout the whole project.\r\nThe overall theme of study across both schools will be 'Change' in year 1 and 'Action' in year 2.  In Year 1 of the project the schools will look at what we would like to change within our communities. Each class will design their own Community Action project on a school and local level which will be shared with each other. They will specifically design and implement Acts of Kindness activities at an individual, class and school level. By the end of the year 1they will move  on to a community Act of Kindness at a local level. This will be dependent on what changes they would like to see in their community. They will compare this with each other and also with The Lahore Lyceum School in Pakistan who will also participate in the project. \r\nIn Year 2 of the project the schools will try to develop further Acts of Kindness activities including  whole school events such as participation on the global Dance of Kindness Day and the World Kindness Day in November. The schools will work together to develop a joint Act of Kindness which will require complete collaboration in order for it to be implemented across both schools simultaneously. These events will be open to the community and may involve other community organizations.\r\nThe final year will see the team gather together to compile the best practice and develop the Scheme of Work for PSHE which the schools formally introduce to all staff in 2019-2020. The Scheme of Work will be shared on the Dissemination Platform, our own websites and e-Twinning. The schools will also hold dissemination seminars in UK and Finland where they will share the Scheme of Work ,teaching methodologies and what Erasmus is.\r\nDunkirk is about to become part of an Academy Trust and will open up the project to everyone in the Trust, enabling them to participate. There are 19 schools in the Trust.\r\nThe sustainable outcome is that the scheme of work developed through this project will be embedded into both schools (and hopefully many more) everyday practice and will become something that everyone uses.", "http://www.dunkirkprimary.com", "Dunkirk Primary and Nursery School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036523_coordinator"], [2017, "Chances for All", "Dunkirk Primary and Nursery School", 13868.0, 2, 2, "Dunkirk holds international linking and global education at the core of it's ethos and vision and has recently won the International School Award for the 5th consecutive time. Dunkirk and Rastaala School have been successfully  linked for 5 years. Many teachers from both schools have taken part in mobilities through our previous Comenius then Erasmus+ KA2 project. \r\nThis KA1project will open up the opportunity for twelve Teaching Assistants at Dunkirk to participate directly in an international mobility and become more involved in the international strand of work across the whole school. Teaching assistants have not yet had any previous opportunity to be directly involved, yet they are key members of staff who work with a range of pupils across every class in school.\r\nThe Teaching assistants work in school with a range of pupils all with varying needs. These needs include severe physical special educational needs (SEN) , emotional SEN, pupils who have experienced trauma (Refugee and asylum seekers),gifted and talented pupils, pupils with specific learning difficulties such as autism, speech and communication difficulties, EAL (English as an additional language), pupils who are suffering deprivation and hence low aspirations and pupils who are underachieving. This role requires a range of strategies and methodologies. \r\nCurrent national expectations of progress for pupils regardless of their specific needs have increased and there are a range of pupils new to the school with different needs, such as refugee and asylum seekers. This has now prompted the school into a review of the role of teaching assistants and if what they do currently can be improved. As we already know Rastaala School, we are very aware of their successful support and integration of pupils with different needs. They have specific expertise in using music and ICT to support such pupils and they have special classes for pupils with significant learning difficulties. They are also developing best practice in supporting pupils who are asylum seekers or refugees.\r\nTwelve teaching assistants have already applied to be a part of the KA1 Job-shadowing project with Rastaala School in Finland. They are all aware of the link and have met teachers who have visited Dunkirk from Rastaala previously. \r\nThis project will allow our twelve teaching assistants to visit Rastaala over a two year period and observe the strategies and methodologies that are so successful in Rastaala. They will discuss and document their findings and then return to Dunkirk and lead an assembly to share their experience with the school and lead a staff meeting where the strategies they have observed are discussed and review of their own practice takes place.\r\nThe project should lead to a more refined and improved provision for our pupils with different needs and with more confident practitioners who have had time to learn from and experience a different international system of supporting pupils with a range of needs. As the use of music and ICT(particularly use of IPads) are a particular specialism for Rastaala, we will see improved use of these in the teaching assistants provision for their targeted pupils back at Dunkirk.\r\nAnother long term benefit will be a higher profile for our link with Finland. The fact that another 12 members of staff will have visited  Rastaala School by the end of the project will ensure that the European dimension of our curriculum and ethos is part of every participants practice. \r\nEach participant will be expected to share their experience in assemblies and lead a staff meeting with their findings. They will also use the school website,  e Twinning and Europass to document their experience and outcomes. The confidence of the participants will increase and their involvement in whole school initiatives and project will increase. A greater European understanding amongst them will develop and this is crucial at this tricky time of Brexit. The participants work closely with pupils at all times and their ability to share their Finnish experiences will enhance the pupils understanding of what being a part of Europe means.\r\nA mid project review will take place by senior leadership and the international coordinator. This will ensure that any difficulties or areas of concern are identified and resolved.\r\nA final evaluation will take place at the end of the project, again by leadership and a questionnaire will be used.

Elite amateur sport men and women are not outside of this reality. They have to develop a dual career at the highest level: both, academic and sportive.  If they want to be at the highest sport level, trainings and competitions are very demanding. At the same time they have to do their best at the university, as their labour future does not depend on the sport, but on their studies and competences.Too often, these students have to renounce living a mobility experience because of the high sport demand.

Crop production has to double by 2050 to keep pace with global population growth increasing to 9 billion. This target is challenging given the impact of climate change on water availability and the drive to reduce fertilizer inputs to make agriculture more environmentally sustainable. In both cases, developing crops with improved water and nutrient uptake efficiency would provide the solution. Root architecture critically influences nutrient and water uptake efficiency. Rooting depth impacts the efficient acquisition of soil nitrogen (and water) since nitrate leaches deep into the soil. Phosphate use efficiency could be significantly improved without increasing root depth by manipulating the angle of root growth to explore the top soil where this macronutrient accumulates. The genes that regulate root traits such as angle, depth and density in crops remain to be identified. A key impediment to genetic analysis of root architecture in crops grown in soil has been the ability to image live roots non-invasively.

The first 3 work packages will create high-throughput \uf06dCT (WP1) and image analysis (WP2) tools that will be used to probe variation in root systems architecture within wheat germplasm collections (WP3). Work packages 4-6 will identify root architectures that improve water (WP4) and nitrate uptake efficiencies (WP5) and pinpoint the genes that regulate these traits.

At high energies, they provide an interesting type of deformations of GR, with the key property that the number of propagating degrees of freedom is the same as in general relativity. To test the asymptotic safety conjecture we shall perform perturbative one-loop computations to determine how these theories are renormalized by quantum corrections and then study the resulting renormalization group flow.

Thus, whilst the pathogenesis of its notorious pathogens (C. botulinum, C. perfringens and C. difficile) is ascribed to the devastating toxins produced (neurotoxins, endotoxins and cytotoxins), it is their capacity to produce spores that lies at the heart of the diseases they cause. This is because spores play the pivotal role in the spread of infection (eg, C. difficile) and in foodstuff contamination and food poisoning (eg, C. botulinum and C. perfringens). The processes of spore formation (sporulation) and germination (return of the dormant spore to toxin-producing, vegetative cells), therefore, represent key intervention points. On the other hand, the majority of clostridia are entirely benign and can sustainably produce all manner of useful chemicals and fuels. Crucially, the regulation of chemical production is intimately linked to that of sporulation. Spores of benign species may also be used as a delivery system for treating cancer. Yet, despite the spore\u2019s importance, little is known of the developmental processes of sporulation and germination.

The approach and content of the Joint Master respond to main challenges faced by the energy sector: To master new energy sources and their implications to the power systems; To reduce CO2 emissions by increasing energy efficiency and the share of clean energies; To gradually incorporate electrical transportation as an alternative to vehicles using combustion engines. Students will carry out the courses in at least 3 different countries, with 2 alternative mobility tracks: Coimbra-Nottingham-Oviedo or Rome-Nottingham-Oviedo. Students will also have the opportunity of an internship in an associated universities or companies in Europe, America or Asia. Course will be taught in English but students will have the opportunity to work in at least other 3 EU official languages. Students will attend a 2-week introductory course at the UniOviedo, to meet other colleagues, University coordinators. Semester 1 will be a Levelling Course to compensate knowledge for different educational background. Students wishing to focus on ST strand will rather spend this first period in Rome, while the focusing on EPS will rather attend lectures in Coimbra. Semester 2 will be devoted to the study of advanced subjects on ST and EPS in Nottingham. During Semester 3 students will complete their specialization in either of the proposed strands in Oviedo. In semester 4 students will carry out an internship in one of the associated Universities or world leading companies, and a guided research for the preparation of the Master Thesis.", "http://www.nottingham.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_574442-EPP-1-2016-1-ES-EPPKA1-JMD-MOB_2"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", 1062668.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.nottingham.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046777_coordinator"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", 1043919.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.nottingham.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035548_coordinator"], [2014, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", 1042042.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.nottingham.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000170_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", 851751.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.nottingham.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023500_coordinator"], [2015, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", 683863.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.nottingham.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012743_coordinator"], [2017, "Supporting Internationalisation of Traineeships in the Healthcare Sector", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", 362900.0, 5, 8, "In healthcare studies which include professional regulation, student learning in clinical practice is an essential part of the curriculum.

Industry 4.0 addresses the \u2018grand challenges\u2019 of the 21st century society, facilitating new innovative products and systems and impacting across a broad range of application areas, where the current international economic situation intensifies the risks posed by increasing energy costs, depleting resources, and employment. The ultimate benefit is to improve affordable health care, higher standards of living, and quality consumer goods, addressing the 3 interlinked priorities identified by the EU strategy Europe 2020, promoting a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, some large companies have integrated the digital tools such as cloud computing, rapid manufacturing, data analytics, virtualization, knowledge library and social networks in several stages of the product life-cycle, driven by the reduced time to market (short product development time), improved productivity (in terms of quality and reduced waste) and management of cost. However, manufacturers are burdened with outdated production facilities and a big inertia toward a radical transformation. \r\n\r\nOn the other side, SMEs could more easily fulfil customized product requirements with computer-based systems that comprise simulation, 3D visualization, analytics, but at the present, they do not have enough awareness of the benefits and requirements of the digitalization and find it difficult to access this information. \r\n\r\nThis proposal will contribute to the skills enhancement of the workforce, by spreading in a systematic, coherent, user friendly, and innovative way the available knowledge on the most recent advancements in this fast growing, resource and knowledge intensive application domain, allowing the participants to acquire and improve the skills on Digital Manufacturing technologies to link IT and industry. \r\n\r\nWhile several books, course and websites already exist associated with Industry 4.0, including a number of initiatives within the VET framework, no e-learning platform is currently available which provides a comprehensive framework on Digital Manufacturing Technologies capabilities on an open access basis.

The European Junior Leadership Academy seeks to address the important priority of developing skills in the European Area by focusing on developing the leadership skills of student nurses. The RELATE project also integrates development of digital and ICT skills into the leadership development of nurses because to deliver the most up to date and modern care, employers need nurses who, on the point of qualification, have the information technology skills necessary to take full advantage of the technological  resources available for patient care and patient outcomes. Enhancement of these skills has the potential to connect practitioners virtually to facilitate the adoption, diffusion and spread of innovation and evidence based nursing practice. The project also targets nurse educators because educating this modern nurse who is a clinical, care and knowledge worker requires highly skilled, digitally literate and innovative educators. RELATE seeks to develop nurses educators from different countries through shared training and experimentation with teaching and social network tools not often seen in nursing education. The team recognises the value of emerging leaders as peer mentors for student nurses. This project will therefore also target nurses in their first year of qualification and develop their peer mentoring skills. The European Junior Leadership Academy (EJLA) programme will identify 40 high performing nursing students from four Higher Education Institutions in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Slovenia and Portugal who demonstrate leadership aptitude and leadership potential. The programme will develop their leadership identity, knowledge, attitudes and skills by creating opportunities for them to observe leaders in action and leaders\u2019 impact on the individuals and organisations they lead. Through leadership retreats, internships, mentoring and peer network projects, the EJLA  will support participants to develop their leadership signature early in their career journey. Materials from the EJLA will be adapted and delivered as a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC). This element of the project aims to expose a wider number of student nurses across Europe and beyond, to leadership development opportunities. The RELATE project is needed because nurses across Europe face the common challenge of delivering more nursing care with less resources. The rising demand for healthcare has been fuelled by an ageing European population, the global epidemic of non communicable illnesses and the information revolution which has resulted in highly informed patients. At the same time, health systems across Europe are under increasing pressure to contain costs. Delivering high quality care under these conditions requires innovative, collaborative nursing practice and cadre of leaders able to operate in different professional situations and cultures. The results of the project include a collection of assets which will be curated on the RELATE website. The assets will include pedagogical resources for student nurses, nurse educators and nurses. These will be available openly to the public.  A Massive Online Open Course will also be produced as part of the project. The MOOC, Lead Now! will be available to any student nurse wishing to take part. The impact of the RELATE project in the local, national , regional and international nursing and nurse education community will be a  wider acceptance of junior leadership as a key talent management objective for student nurses. Locally, health facilities and higher education institutions will benefit from students and newly qualified/emerging leaders increased leadership identity and skills through the generation of more ideas for service and care improvement and more ability to initiate change.

Inform and education will be provided through staff training which will offer sustainble knowledge for further multimedia development within each participating school. \r\n6.  Students will engage in a blended learning approach including completion  and evaluation of the new RLO suite and face to face discussion groups based on extension work provided by the teachers within the partnership. Two international blended mobilities for students will offer the RLO suite  for 50 nursing students in 'summer schools'.  This will be based upon the developing material and upon good experiences from the previous co-operation.   Students will work together from the five particIpant schools thus giving a face to face opportunity to explore their cultural views of other and reflect upon their own views. Student evaluation will be integrated in the material development.\r\n\r\nProcess \r\nThe working process is in phases relating to intellectual outputs with the transnational meetings acting as \u201cmilestones\u201d. Every meeting will include the collation and sharing of results from the previous work, relating to outputs as well as processes. Results will be discussed and agreed and following from this the next phase will be planned. At least 2 partners will share responsibilities at any meeting: the hosting partner is responsible for organising and hosting the meeting, 1 partner is the lead for the previous work packages and responsible for the conclusion. 1 partner is the lead for the next work package and responsible for the preparation and introduction.  This way, any potential risks or problems such as time keeping or communication problems will be identified and addressed. Project outcomes such as the development, implementation and evaluation of the RLO as the central working phases will be documented and will influence further work.\r\n\r\nImpact is expected on different levels.  The Network will have an eLearning tool which can be used by all partners to prepare mobility: this ensures quality in the teaching/learning process regarding mobilities. It is hoped that using the RLO will motivate and encourage students and nurses for mobilities, thereby bringing back from abroad important experiences which will change their professional performance in nursing and also makes them more reflective European citizens.", "http://www.nottingham.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA203-036612_coordinator"], [2017, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM", 164440.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

Therefore, if the current expansion of LED technologies is most welcomed from an economic and energy point of view, it requires optimising resource flows and addressing key societal issues. To strengthen the emerging LED market in Europe, cycLED focuses on improvement of the material flows and policy measures to remove barriers for LED technology dissemination. Innovation is needed to achieve an efficient management of the different materials used in LED systems, so that the growth of the LED-related markets is decoupled from resource depletion. A material flow analysis will first be conducted to obtain an overview of the most relevant materials contained in LED products, their origin and the situation regarding recycling. Further research will focus on the different life-cycle phases (production and manufacturing, assembling, use and material recycling) to provide overall solutions to improve the resource flows.

System design of the electric power-train is based on existing components currently in different phases of the development process. Integrating these components into an electric power-train using current designs can only result in a suboptimal solution since components are generally not designed for integration, but rather to optimally fulfill the supplier's requirement specification.It is postulated that the most cost effective and reliable design is a highly integrated solution that reduces interfaces, variations of components and uses synergy effects e. g. common housing/casing wherever possible. The large design effort for such integration requires sufficiently large number of produced systems and will thus become attractive when the market enters the strong growth phase. This is expected around 2020 or early as 2018.Optimally integrated solutions are not achieved by simply assembling existing components, but by ensuring that components are designed according to integration aspects of the system requirements and by implementing and testing the complete integration early in the process.This project aims to develop a compact, efficient, highly integrated electromechanical powertrain, production optimized to deliver key cost reduction goals. The partners will focus on optimizing the integrated unit for an entry power level of a typical urban vehicle. In parallel they will assess scalability potential to meet the performance criteria of other platforms.

The reason that this existing WTDT is so widely employed is that it is cost-effective because it makes use of widely available industrial components and adopts a low-cost partially-rated converter. The proposed medium-speed WTDT leverages the advantages of the existing DFIG WTDT, but also improves upon the intrinsic reliability by adopting: a) Medium-speed Brushless DFIG, excluding brush-gear and slip-rings, known to be the highest failure rate components in the generator; b) Partially-rated converter, identical to the high-speed WTDT; c) 2-stage gearbox, excluding the third high-speed stage, known to be the highest failure rate section of the gearbox. The project aims to move the Brushless DFIG technology from being a promising and proven concept, demonstrated in small-scale, to an optimized industrial-scale drivetrain for multi-MW wind turbines. The Brushless DFIG has been demonstrated on a 20 kW wind turbine and most recently, a 250 kW prototype generator on a test bed.

The school is based in the city centre of Nottingham, in the East Midlands of England.  The school plays an active part in the wider community, providing opportunities for pupils of all backgrounds through bursaries for school placements as well as outreach work to local schools in sports, music and latterly, MFL.  \r\n\r\nNottingham High School is experienced in working with Erasmus+ and The British Council having run a successful and highly scored small-scale project in 2017-2018 to enhance the provision of primary French within the Infant and Junior Schools.  The school has a highly successful senior MFL department which runs many trips abroad every year.  \r\n\r\nMiss Fiona Riley is the Project Leader and Participant.  Her role is Head of MFL (Infant and Junior) and she has established aims and objectives for this new project and put together a clear two year project plan which will ensure that it will build on the successes of our first project which she is also currently leading. She has experience of preparing and submitting an application, monitoring a project and developing resources and curriculum enhancements, following an immersion course in France and is now confident and experienced in managing the administrative and monitoring aspects of such a project.   \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to firmly establish the school as a prominent centre of French and Spanish primary tuition and to become a positive influencer for change through work with local primary schools to strengthen their primary languages curriculum.  This will be done by establishing a programme of outreach workshops where expertise in primary language teaching can be shared and disseminated, providing opportunities in languages and intercultural understanding for pupils of all backgrounds.  \r\n\r\nThe Project Leader has a clear vision for the structure of this two-year project.  During the first year, she will participate in three separate mobility activities to enhance and develop her language skills, intercultural understanding and links with primary schools in France and Spain. These will take the form of two structured immersion courses in Spain, as well as one bespoke structured language course in France.  During these mobility activities, the Project Leader will build strong links with two link primary schools - one in each country - as well as gaining fluency in both languages. In the second year of the project, the Project Leader will focus on creating a strong programme of outreach primary language workshops working with local primary schools in Nottinghamshire.   \r\n\r\nTools on the eTwinning site such as eTwinning Live and Twinspaces will be used to support the running of the project and to establish strong working relationships with the link schools, and the Europass Languages Passport will also be used throughout the project to assess the language skills of the participant.  \r\n\r\nThe project will be regularly assessed and monitored throughout to ensure a high quality output and impact with monitoring points built in at the start, middle and end of the project.  The project will be assessed by the Senior Leadership Team of the school through lesson observations, work scrutiny, meetings to discuss development plans and teacher appraisal meetings as well as an assessment of visibility of languages within the school through displays, clubs and pupil enjoyment.   \r\n\r\nThe impact of this project is envisaged to be significant and wide-reaching.  As well as the pupils in the Project Leader's school (of whom she teaches 290), the impact will be seen on parents, prospective parents and pupils, visitors to the school, pupils and teachers in the local primary schools involved in the outreach workshop programme, and teachers (and pupils taught by those teachers) who network with the Project Leader in teaching communities such as Facebook/Whatsapp and the Association for Languages local network meetings.", "http://www.nottinghamhigh.co.uk", "Nottingham High School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047065_coordinator"], [2017, "Promotion of Modern Foreign Languages (French) for juniors", "Nottingham High School", 2010.0, 1, 1, "Our school is Nottingham High Infant and Junior School, an independent, fee-paying school educating children aged from 4 to 11 years old, and which forms part of the Nottingham High School.

The Headmaster of the Senior School is Mr Kevin Fear and the Headteacher of the Infant and Junior Schools is Mrs Clare Bruce.  The schools are all on one site and form part of one whole school.   \r\n\r\nThis project was conceived of when Miss Fiona Riley joined the school in January 2016 to take up the role of Head of Modern Foreign Languages (Infants and Juniors).  New to subject leadership, Miss Riley was keen to create and deliver a rich, stimulating and exciting modern foreign languages curriculum for the pupils, using authentic materials and resources.  The school offers a wide-ranging curriculum which encourages pupils to be independent, confident and flexible in their thinking and a modern foreign languages curriculum which encourages confident fluency in speaking is key to this ethos.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to bring rich, authentic resources to the curriculum; to enhance the modern foreign languages teaching in the school; to encourage greater connections and communication opportunities with native speakers of French; and to forge links with a primary school in France.  The only participant in this project will be Miss Riley; she was chosen due to the fact that she is a specialist language teacher and the sole teacher of languages in the school.  \r\n\r\nThe core activity in this project will be the participation of Miss Riley in an intensive, immersive French course run by PQ French in Carcassonne, France. This course will be an eight day residential course during which Miss Riley will have the opportunity to network and share ideas with other primary language teachers and subject leaders; to participate in French lessons to enhance her language skills; to visit the local area in France, to gain greater local understanding, enhance her vocabulary, learn additional 'real-life' French vocabulary, gather authentic resources and realia, and visit and connect with French primary school teachers.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives, findings and outcomes of the project will be recorded in the MFL Development Plan, the annual budget, the long-term and medium-term planning of the school, as well as through the use of the Europass Language Passport.  \r\n\r\nWe hope that through the delivery of this project, the modern foreign languages curriculum in the infant and junior schools will be greatly enhanced; pupils will gain a greater understanding of the real-life experience of living and studying in France; they will be exposed to a wider range of authentic vocabulary through new materials and resources; they will benefit from their MFL subject leader having a wide and rich network of contacts and they will gain greater communication skills through having the opportunity to communicate directly with native speakers of French.", "http://www.nottinghamhigh.co.uk", "Nottingham High School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036053_coordinator"]]}}, "5PN": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "PRACTICUM DEPO 2018", "Castle Cavendish Foundation", 577218.0, 14, 39, "Diputaci\u00f3n of Pontevedra is a public institution clearly committed to the sustainable development of the province.

In addition, there are young people with no motivation for employment, low-skilled in a second language, and with little ICT competences at a professional level, and therefore, with difficulty for access to labour market. Furthermore, we find companies in the province demanding prepared young people, as a consequence of the competitiveness misbalance within the European common market that cannot satisfy companies' needs, feeding the EU skills gap.\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome such skills gap of the province, with a strong rural character, the Diputaci\u00f3n has formed a Consortium, with 37 VET schools in Pontevedra and Employment Workshop and authorized courses with Certificate of Competences, which will offer 105 young VET graduates in one of these centres, the possibility of carrying out work practices, for 6 months (ErasmusPro), in a European company. Participants must return from their mobility within 12 months after obtaining their degree.

This equates to 250,000tonnes p.a. with \u2018soilage\u2019 (soil/grass/stones/etc). Agricultural plastic film waste has proven difficult to recycle commercially due to the high levels of contamination and its wide geographical dispersion which lead to high transport costs. This means that recycling schemes require financial support from governments and/or must charge high fees in order to be financially sustainable. Hence many farmers use alternative, environmentally harmful, disposal methods, such as burning or land-filling, which do not take advantage of the latent value of recyclates and do not comply with current and future legislation.
