It has 511 children on roll and 77 staff including teachers, teaching assistants, midday assistants, cleaners and maintenance staff. \r\n\r\nIt was identified by the Head Teacher and Subject Leader that the teaching and learning of French was not as consistent within the timetable as the other foundation subjects. After a staff audit was completed in September 2017, the Subject Leader identified that the main reason for low progression across Key Stage Two was that most staff felt under-confident in the pedagogy of language teaching and speaking and listening. \r\n\r\nTo address this Winsford High Street will be using a KA1 Erasmus+ grant to allow twelve participants to travel to Carcassonne, France for French immersion training. Our project will last 24 months and participants will travel in pairs. The courses will each run for 8 days and will involve the participants in language learning that is planned to their ability, creation of resources, use of songs and games within teaching and learning plus time to work within a French school. \r\n\r\nThe impact that the project will have on the school will be an overall increase in confidence, motivation and enthusiasm for the teaching and learning of French. This will be reflected upon the staff and children at High Street. The children will have a stronger grasp of the language and grammar skills developed through the use of resources, games, songs and activities learnt by participants in France. The children will develop their cultural understanding; they will realise that there is life outside Winsford that is both culturally and linguistically rich. \r\n\r\nDissemination of the project results will be filtered through via the Subject Leader and Head teacher plus the participants. This will be evidenced through the use of staff meetings, a termly book and planning scrutiny, classroom learning walks and lesson observations plus the mid-term and end term reports that will also be presented to staff and the governors.", "http://www.winsfordhighstreetprimary.co.uk", "Winsford High Street Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047274_coordinator"]]}}, "2DF": {"nhs": {"data": [["RBT", "Elmhurst Intermediate Care Centre", "nhs_RBTPP"]]}}, "2GN": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Antygypsism \u2013 Mobile Books", "Home Space Sustainable Accommodation CIC", 16112.0, 11, 11, "This project brings together 30 youth leaders, workers, multipliers, trainers and volunteers from over 11 different countries during a 7 day lasting seminar in Struga, Macedonia, and it involves them in a long  lasting preparatory and follow-up process. As the venue is in Macedonia, a study visit and the final performance using Living Library method will take place in the Roma municipality with more than 80 000 Roma inhabitants.\r\n\r\nRoma rights are violated every day in Europe. Even if authorities acknowledge the socio-economic situation of Roma as a problematic issue, they are often denied their full rights as equal citizens, excluded from an active role in policy design and implementation, and approached in a patronizing manner. Such \u2018applied anti-Gypsyism\u2019 is the background to the unequal treatment of Roma \u2013 on the labour market, or in the provision of social services such as housing, healthcare and education. \r\nThe European Union\u2019s Fundamental Rights Agency concluded that the Roma are the most discriminated against group in the EU: \u201cEvery second Roma respondent said that they were discriminated against on the basis of their ethnicity\u201d\r\nThe 9th meeting of the EU Platform on Roma pointed out that emphasis should be placed on promoting Roma equal citizenship and human rights approach when addressing the situation of Roma.

French is delivered by each class teacher in Key Stage 2 for 30 minutes each week. In Key Stage 1, children have the opportunity to develop their language skills through rhymes and songs. Since the introduction of the new National Curriculum in September 2014, MFL is now a statutory subject which means that there is new challenge for teachers and through a scrutiny of the subject, SLT has revealed that it is a key area for development. Staff at St Joseph's are extremely under-confident about their French skills and this is impacting on provision for children and the progress being made in the subject. In order to address this issue, St Joseph's plans to use the Erasmus+ Key Action 1 programme to send 5 members of staff to France to participate in immersion courses where they will have the opportunity to take part in high quality language lessons which are delivered by native speakers. Through personalised and bespoke language classes, our teachers will be supported and encouraged to practice their French as much as possible. The immersion courses will provide cultural activities and visits whereby participants learn about the region and practice French with local people in real life situations. Each of our 5 participants will visit the same primary school during their courses, learning about the French education system, sharing teaching ideas and developing a link.During the project, participants will share their experiences and learning with staff back at school and parents will be kept informed through the school website. After the project has been completed, allocated staff meetings will enable participants to share engaging ideas which will help facilitate excellence in the primary language classroom.   We expect this project will have a lasting impact on our staff and pupils; staff will have improved language skills and confidence and children will be enthusiastic language learners with new friends in France and a growing awareness of their own place in Europe.", "http://www.stjosephs.cheshire.sch.uk", "St Joseph's Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023542_coordinator"]]}}, "3EP": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Shared languages, shared ethos", "Wharton Cof E Primary School (Winsford).", 3463.0, 1, 1, "As a staff we need to increase our ability to teach Spanish in order to be able to confidently deliver the government requirement of teaching language in Key stage 2 and also to continue with the development of Spanish in Key stage 1/EYFS. We aim to improve the professional competence of the team with the extra training provided and hope that the sharing of ideas will lead to raised attainment for our pupils. We are focusing on raising standards in literacy and want to look at further ways of using language teaching to support literacy learning, particularly in the case of children with low basic skills and those with special educational needs.\r\n\r\nWe want to provide more motivating materials for pupils and establish regular contact with another school with the aim of uploading work to compare with our partner school. This will provide a meaningful context in which to use the language we learn and help to motivate learners. \r\n\r\nWe would like to raise the profile of our partner language, involving parents in their children\u2019s learning and establishing an international dimension.

We would like  teachers to take part in a training course in Spain. The course that we have identified involves intensive language training, cultural knowledge and activities, teaching activities and methodology (including evaluation of resources) and a placement in a Spanish school leading to a link that can be used by our whole school.\r\n\r\nThese two teachers will develop greater confidence and and a better knowledge of the Spanish language through this course. They will also greatly increase their knowledge and understanding about Spain (through the activities on the course and also through the placement in the Spanish school). They will then look for ways to spread this new knowledge and the skills they have gained to the rest of the staff. This will involve CPD sessions in staff meetings where they will help the rest of the staff to develop their Spanish, and share ideas and resources with them.\r\n\r\nThis will lead to us being a better skilled staff more able to teach Spanish to a high standard to all our childrenand give them an enjoyable and authentic experience and establishing international links (particularly focusing on sharing our Christian ethos).
