Their period was marked by political stability and an astonishing florescence in every field of endeavor. The Gupta kingdom and its networks had an enduring impact on India and a profound reach across Central and Southeast Asia in a host of cultural, religious and socio-political spheres. Sometimes characterized as a \u2018Golden Age\u2019, this was a pivotal moment in Asian history. The Guptas have received considerable scholarly attention over the last century, as have, separately, the kingdoms of Central and Southeast Asia. Recent advances notwithstanding, knowledge and research activity are fragmented by entrenched disciplinary protocols, distorted by nationalist historiographies and constrained by regional languages and associated cultural and political agendas. Hemmed in by modern intellectual, geographical and political boundaries, the diverse cultures, complex polities and varied networks of the Gupta period remain specialist subjects, little-mentioned outside area studies and traditional disciplinary frameworks. The aim of this project is to work beyond these boundaries for the first time and so recover this profoundly influential dispensation, presenting it as a vibrant entity with connections across several regions and sub-continental areas. To address this aim, three PIs have formed an interdisciplinary team spanning linguistics, history, religious studies, geography, archaeology, Indology, Sinology and GIS/IT technologies. This team will establish a scientific laboratory in London that will generate the synergies needed to delineate and assess the significance of the Gupta Age and its pan-Asian impacts.

Pottery vessels are no longer viewed in western archaeology as a material correlate of sedentary farming life in the Neolithic. Despite recognition of pottery vessels in hunter-gatherer contexts in some parts of northern Europe and the former Soviet Union, their impact on, and role in, hunter-gatherer lifeways has been regarded as peripheral to mainstream European prehistory. This proposal seeks to rebalance the evidence and the debate, placing the innovation, dispersal and use of pottery vessels among hunter-gatherers in NE Europe at the heart of the enquiry. Virtually nothing is known of the choices underlying the adoption of pottery vessels or the uses to which they were put. Similarly, there is little understanding of the environmental contexts that led to the emergence of pottery or the timing and dynamics of its apparent westward dispersal across NE Europe, nor its legacy following the introduction of food production. Addressing these lacunae is the motivation for this proposal. INDUCE will tackle these important challenges with an integrated approach to reconstructing the contextual life histories of over 2000 pottery vessels, enhancing chronological control of early pottery horizons through 600 14C dates, investigating the typology of several thousand vessels from across the study region, creating spatio-temporal models for the spread of different pottery traditions and documenting the impact of the introduction of farming on the use of vessels for resource utilisation.

Recent research has shown that the Atlantic seaboard is the most likely route for colonisation due to the more oceanic climate compared to eastern Europe and to the richer range of resources in coastal areas. Due to cyclical changes in climate with glaciations and interglacials, northern Europe was frequently depopulated and then recolonized through this period probably from source areas in southern France and Iberia. This route-way should therefore bear witness to the cultural links between north and south. From 1 million to 600,000 years ago there is evidence of brief pioneering events in north-west Europe with a small number of sites and small numbers of stone tool artefacts. After 600,000 year ago more sustained occupation is shown by the increase in sites and the much large stone tool assemblages.

(Changing places: Mid-career review and internal mobility, Eurofound Report January 2017)\r\n\r\nRecent OECD research has highlighted that there are many millions of adults in Europe with low levels of functional literacy and/or numeracy skills and that the majority of these are in employment (OECD Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) 2016). This has negative implications for their employment potential and longer term career prospects.\r\n\r\nThe concept of the Mid Life Career Review (MLCR) is one which is gradually gaining favour in many countries and the role of social partners in both lobbying for and delivering elements of this is one that could be critical to its success (Eurofound 2017).

Further, the reviewers across the partnership will be encouraged to become \u2018mid-life skills champions\u2019, with the support of online tools and a virtual e-network. This network will support its members and share ideas and experience.\r\n\r\nAs well as a new suite of materials and in keeping with the European priority for prioritising the recognition of skills and qualifications, we will accredit learning through a new online digital badge and explore linking this into the Europass CV Programme.

Since interests of both workers and the public have to be reconciled simultaneously, labour disputes regarding public services are trickier than those in the industrial sector, which makes affairs of public sector unions very crucial. Furthermore, officials carrying out negotiations with unions find themselves on a difficult spot, because working conditions for the public sector are determined by law. \r\n\r\nThe health sector is among the largest in the public sector. According to statistics published by the Ministry of Health, there are more than 124 thousand medical doctors in Turkey, while total number of health workers exceeds 700 thousand. Given their publicly critical duties and responsibilities, it is clear how complicated and arduous it can be for health workers to pursue union rights compared to other public servants. \r\n\r\nThe European Commission\u2019s 2014 Progress Report of Turkey voices serious criticism regarding social and union rights and working conditions. The report mentions many issues such as strike delays, workplace accidents, union obstruction and child labour. According to the report, laws and regulations concerning union rights need to be revised and a more permissive environment should be created for trade unions. Rights to unionisation, participation in collective bargaining and strike need to be adjusted in accordance with the EU acquis and international standards. The report states that small amendments to union rights made by the government are not satisfactory and that fundamental issues and violations of social and union rights persist. \r\n\r\nBy analyzing advancements and applications relating to the future of trade unions in Turkey and globally, impediments to public sector unions can be overcome. To do so, forming active union policies, developing collective struggle strategies, presenting resulting propositions to the public, and opening social dialog are among the practices required. Considering the pioneering role of public sector unions, if they become weak and ineffective, private sector unions as well as the Turkish union movement in general would suffer. \r\n\r\nConsequently, education and training in union affairs for the public sector is of critical importance. This project involves training of 20 union representatives and officials in an EU member state. The participants are going to gain awareness, knowledge and experience in trade unions of EU standards. Following the mobility activity, a workshop will be organized and resulting reports and booklets will be distributed along union branches throughout Turkey and will be presented to the Ministry of Health. Seminars will be organized in various health institutions in order to disseminate gained knowledge to other health workers.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-TR01-KA104-017025_1"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2016, "TRADE UNION CONGRESS TUC*", 4678.0, "Cost of preliminary consultation meetings with trade union representatives (04.03.01.01)", "fts_2016_31411"], [2017, "TRADE UNION CONGRESS TUC*", 4239.0, "Cost of preliminary consultation meetings with trade union representatives (04.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_31576"], [2016, "TRADE UNION CONGRESS TUC*", 1861.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18390"], [2016, "TRADE UNION CONGRESS TUC*", 958.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18917"], [2017, "TRADE UNION CONGRESS TUC*", 448.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_19821"], [2016, "TRADE UNION CONGRESS TUC*", 421.0, "Other management expenditure (33.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_26808"]]}}, "3QJ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1301616000000, 1427760000000, "Advancing Sustainable In Situ Remediation for Contaminated Land and Groundwater", "Contaminated Land: Applications in Real Environments", "This project will develop innovative in situ remediation concepts for the sustainable management of contaminated land and groundwater, as required by the WFD.

Due to the non traditional configuration of contemporary conflicts and the diversification of the actors implicated therein, violations of international human rights and humanitarian law have taken on new forms. Either the existing legal framework must be strengthened, or new legal responses must be developed.
