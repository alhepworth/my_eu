Replication potential will be demonstrated in medical diagnostics, Fluid Catalytic Cracking and consumer products.

Reclaiming of rare-earth magnet motors/generators used in (H)EVs is a major challenge because the magnets are difficult to remove from the assemblies.

It was hereto identified that French language provision was suffering due to a lack of staff confidence in their subject knowledge and an overall need to upskill in order to meet the already high standards at the school and provide children with the best possible opportunities. \r\n\r\nA new Subject Leader was appointed to address the overall provision of Modern Foreign Language (French) teaching and to establish next steps. A staff audit overwhelmingly identified a general lack of confidence in staff (in MFL), the need to upskill and the need to raise the profile of French across the school. Our Erasmus+ project, \u2018Wolverham MFL Confidence and Profile Builder\u2019 was set up to address these needs using short and long term strategies. It was felt that long term, the most effective way to address these needs would be for a core team of participants to engage in immersion courses, with a view to them taking on timetabled teaching roles across the school, but also disseminating their experiences and new skills to all staff, therefore embedding French across the curriculum and throughout the school day.\r\n\r\nThe four participants are a selection of  highly motivated qualified Primary class teachers and Teaching Assistants (TAs), who presently teach across Key Stages one (KS1)  and two (KS2). Currently, the Subject Leader teaches all French lessons in KS2 and French does not formally appear on the timetable in KS1. This project will upskill the Subject Leader, who will establish planning and assessment documents. Other participants, once upskilled, will take on teaching roles across the school, introducing French into KS1 and providing a greater resource of provision for the school in general. \r\n\r\nImmersion courses will provide participants with the opportunity to experience French life, deepen their understanding of French culture and everyday life and to provide them with the tools to use the French language confidently. Participants will spend eight days in the town of Carcassonne, France, conversing with locals, researching the area and wider region and generally experiencing French culture through cultural activities and guided visits, including visiting French schools to see them in action. They will attend language lessons with native French speakers and develop their approaches to teaching through methodology and pedagogy sessions. \r\n\r\nThe project is designed to have immediate impact on the teaching and profile of French at Wolverham.  Longer term, it will raise the confidence and enthusiasm of all staff, thereby ensuring that French is not taught as a stand-alone subject by one teacher but embedded across the curriculum throughout both key stages and seen as a communication tool. Opportunities to rehearse and consolidate French will be identified and development of all skills will greatly improve. In short, staff confidence will be raised and French will take on a higher profile in school, creating learners that are engaged, enthusiastic and highly motivated to find out about a world of language.", "http://wpns.org.uk", "Wolverham Primary & Nursery School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036461_coordinator"]]}}, "6SG": {"nhs": {"data": [["RJR", "Ellesmere Port Hospital", "nhs_RJR60"]]}}}}
