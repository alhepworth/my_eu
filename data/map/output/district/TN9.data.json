SMARTFISH exploits technological developments in machine vision, camera technology, data processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data analysis, smartphones/tablets, LED technology, acoustics and ROV technology to build systems for monitoring, analyzing and improving processes for all facets of the fishing sector, from extraction, to assessment, to monitoring and control. The SMARTFISH systems will:\n- assist fishermen in making informed decisions during pre-catch, catching, and post-catch phases of the extraction process. This improves catch efficiencies and compositions in fisheries across the EU, leading to improved economic efficiency while reducing unintended fish mortality, unnecessary fishing pressure and ecosystem damage.\n- provide new data for stock assessment from commercial fishing and improve the quality and quantity of data that comes from traditional assessment surveys. This provides more accurate assessment of currently assessed stocks and allow the assessment of data-poor stocks.\n- permit the automatic collection of catch data to ensure compliance with fisheries management regulations. \nThe SMARTFISH systems are tested and demonstrated in several EU fisheries. This contributes to promoting the uptake of the systems by extraction sector and fisheries agencies.

BIM softwares are used to plan, design, construct, operate and maintain many kinds of buildings and infrastructures. In Europe BIM is becoming more and more studied in VET schools, VET courses and university courses and applied in companies. It is becoming a new specialization with a high rate of employability.In Italy this methodology is not yet sufficiently known and spread, while in other EU countries, especially in northern Europe, BIM is already very well know and used: Finland is one of the earliest adopters of BIM, and it has been for years at the forefront of Building Information Modelling; in other northern european countries like Norway BIM research and development goes back to more than twenty years ago, and nowadays it\u2019s one of the leading Countries using BIM with one of the European highest implementation of BIM among architects and installators.Considering the lack of homogeneous tools validated at European level for training in BIM, this project has the aim of building a bridge between Northern Europe and Southern Europe: Italy will have the opportunity to learn from the European best experiences paving the way to other Southern Europe Countries, while Finland and Norway will have the opportunity to enlarge their international BIM-related network of institution and companies and update  their knowledge from mutual exchange of best practices and innovation of training tools.Excellence in the area of BIM is possible at the moment only through transnational cooperation, standing the big difference of knowlege, awareness, entrepreneurial attitudes and implementation rates among EU Countries.The project GENERAL AIM therefore is to deepen knowledge about Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a skills' development training subject for employability goals, upgrading existing training tools and professional qualifications and creating a network to promote work-based learning with special attention to apprenticeship.BIM project is a capacity building project in the area of VET promoting cooperation and partnership among 6 different organizations (VET provider, Regional Authority, 2 universities, private company, EU association).

The motivation of BIM partners to participate in the project is strongly connected to the obseversation of local needs and the aknowledgement about the necessity to try to cover the gap between skills's qualifications levels and the requirements from job market.
