It first disappeared in 1785 but was re-introduced from Sweden in 1837 as a game bird. By the 1970s the populations numbered around 20,000 birds.  Since then, however, its decline has been dramatic with population numbers dropping to around 1,000 birds.  Key threats include mortality through collisions with deer fences, predation of chicks, lack of suitable foraging sites for newly-hatched chicks and, above all, the severe fragmentation and reduced quality of the capercaillie's prime woodland habitats.   A number of emergency conservation efforts have been carried out in recent years but these were neither large scale nor wide spread and remained predominantly localised programmes.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=1975", "http://www.capercaillie-life.info/,", "life_241"]]}}}}
