This vocational training period has to be completed in order to pass the European standard BTECH diploma in Cookery and Catering, and provides the students with a mobility opportunity abroad, an opening into European Multicultural Citizenship and development of their vocational and linguistic skills. These students, who are registered in the second year of the three year European B Tech, in the Cookery, Service and Restaurant modules have already undertaken a first year Vocational BTECH. They comprise 2 classes of 24 students.  The first group will go to work placements in Europe in September 2014, the second group will have their training period in March - April 2015, The next class, of 48 students, will be divided in half so 24 will be sent in September - October 2015 and the others 24 in March - April 2016. In total 96 students, both boys and girls will benefit from these mobilities. The pupils are often quite young and some have challenging social backgrounds. The financial support from Erasmus+ contributes to a good quality, well-structured training opportunity.Since 2004, we have been building a network of receiving hotels in Ireland, Scotland and Estonia and have worked hard to establish these contacts. These European countries were chosen for ease of access from France, The receiving partners are all high quality hotels and restaurants.The aim of our students is to pass their Vocational B TECH and to obtain the Europass certificate. After being prepared for the mobility, the students, travelling in pairs, are supervised and monitored by our local partners. The receiving hotels or resturaants keep in touch with the tutor in charge of the project. Teachers from the Lyc\u00e9e visit to assess the trainee.

They are enrolled in a complementary local initiative training - FCIL: Adaptability to Cooking and Catering Trade in Europe and Abroad (Adaptation aux M\u00e9tiers de l'H\u00f4tellerie en Europe et \u00e0 l'International).Our participants are mainly from the Paris area and they come from modest social backgrounds. They require financial and an organisational help. Our aims are to prepare our students to adapt to diverse cultural and vocational situations to enrich their lives. This project aims to further their vocational and social integration into the world of work and to familiarize them with applying a Lifelong Learning training. At our Lyc\u00e9e, our involvement in European programmes is part of the \"European and International Opening\" axis of our school project. This international dimension is likely to enhance our desirability in terms of recruitment and employability, contributing to the excellent reputation of our training and enhance the positive image of our school. Our project is supported by the strong C.H.A.S.E Network (Consortium of Hospitality and Accommodation Schools Schools of Europe) which is now of 24 years standing and has 14 partner catering schools or institutions located in 13 European countries: Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Finland , Ireland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, and Turkey. It is thanks to this network that the mobility projects can be realised; the wide range of European destinations has a strong attraction for students wanting to participate. In order to coordinate our activities, improve communication and to make long-lasting partnerships, a annual meeting is organized where we decide on a joint focus for the project e,g, this year we chose: Awareness of Health and Nutrition in the Cookery and Catering sector in Europe, The mobilities last for five months. During the first 4 weeks there is a period of cultural and linguistic training to prepare the students for their internships in hotels or restaurants. During the four months internship students are accommodated in the hotel or in nearby hostels or apartments. Students have a nominated supervisor in the hotel or restaurant placements and are also monitored by a tutor from the receiving partner and from the Lyc\u00e9e, the sending organisation.

Three of the students are from the fashion department. As our students are trained in modern languages, we have chosen the following countries for the internship: Italy, France, Malta, Ireland, Spain and Great Britain. Our students will be trained in theory (language skills) and in practice beforehand. Additionally, they will be supported by the Erasmus+ team (contact via WhatsApp/facebook) during the internship.After the internship an evaluation will be carried out by the partner hotel. Means of evaluation will be the ECVET \u2013 form and the Learning Agreement.Students are encouraged to gain further practical knowledge and skills in hotel industry which have already been provided in theory in order to be well-prepared for their future working life. Therefore our students should be given the possibility to work in fields like:restaurant, reception, bar, administration, room service, housekeeping, concierge, seminar and conference area. From our point of view, there will be a noticeable increase in the employability because of the internship.Besides improving their practical skills, our trainees should strengthen their social skills and their self-confidence (personal capabilities), which means that responsibility, independency, self-confidence, ability to work on their own, team spirit, ability to listen, friendliness, ability to communicate with their superiors, colleagues and guests. Moreover, our students should encounter the differences of various cultures and traditions and their characteristics to develop an open-minded tolerance.Another important aim is to improve language skills. Students should be able to use their acquired language skills in order to broaden their communication skills in daily work life.Furthermore, we would like to stress that the sense of belonging to the European Union should be created and increased to make the EU be realized as a chance for personal and professional development. Employing foreign students in their hotels, people show interest in different nationalities and also in the willingness to train and support the young. This will be documented by using the following tools: Letter of Intent, Learning Agreement, Personal Transcript, Europass and ECVET.

Using these tools, the cooperation with the hotels will be intensified. That\u2019s why increased action of the accompanying teachers will be necessary especially at the beginning.Apart from the EU aspect, long-term impacts on the participant, school site and the Austrian educational system are stressed.

The content has been divided into three phases: first of all, the reasons that push minors to leave their home country, secondly, the dangers and risks regarding their journey, and finally, the difficulties they might face once in Europe. Furthermore, participants will receive information about international conventions concerning the rights of men and children and, additionally, the mobility options proposed by Erasmus+.\r\n\r\nIn the months ahead of the exchange, every group conducts a research about the situation of unaccompanied minors in their own city/country. During the exchange, all participants are invited to actively participate in debates and round table discussions where they can share and exchange their opinion. With the aim of accurately tackling the subject, different learning methods will be alternated throughout the exchange: individual preparation, assemblies allowing the encounter with professionals, excursions to venues where unaccompanied minors are being received, documentaries etc. The exchange will also propose moments of social encounters and animations: games, intercultural evenings, social dinners, official receptions and cultural excursions. Besides, we intend to execute our project according to the framework of sustainable development: recycling, waste management, site visit of natural areas etc. Finally, a blog will facilitate the communication and retention of the work done during the youth exchange.

Students will carry out projects revolving around public relations activities, i.e. resulting in events such as public debates and panel discussions on the one hand, and media products such as websites including documentary film clips and podcasts on the other hand. The projects will deal with topics of local and European / international relevance.

Enriques (Castelfiorentino, Italy) and Otto-Hahn-Gymnasium Ostfildern (Ostfildern, Germany). It is aimed at general and vocational students aged 15-18.\r\n  \r\nWe see the need for increasing the speaking skills and oral proficiency of our students so that they are enabled to prove their qualifications in European standardised tests. Test results have shown that foreign language classroom teaching often enables students to achieve  adequate levels in the understanding and in the writing part of standardised exams, but that they fall behind in the speaking part.  \r\n\r\nWe want to achieve higher language proficiency in cooperation with language test institutions and with members from The English Academy (TEA), a language educator think tank in Giessen.  We will work together via the e-twinning platform, in online video conferences and in intercultural project meetings. \r\n\r\nWe will adapt existing didactic material, but we will lay emphasis on our students creating material like games, phrase cards and 'speaking prompts' for each other because this makes them personally involved in the topics. They identify more closely with the speaking situations and their context. \r\nWhen creating a pair of 'speaking prompts' for the topic of 'health vs. drugs, alcohol, smoking', they will follow the requirements for the Speaking Part of European language exams, and create two A4 sheets with their own photos presenting different situations, and with opposing statements/quotations. This material will be used in the foreign language classrooms in our schools and will prepare the topics for the meetings. \r\n\r\nIn order to create plurilingual speaking opportunities in CLIL-like surroundings, the students' meetings are organised as workstays. The first day of each meeting will be consecrated to a language workshop so that students are familiarised with the host country's language and introduced to the workstay. English will be the communication language in this project and the language used on e-twinning and in publications. \r\n\r\nThe level aimed for in the final language tests depends on the years of teaching and ranges from B1 to B2/C1, whereas the other country languages reach levels from basic/A1 to A2/B1/B2. During the workstays English will be used at B1/B2 level, with specific terms (Fachsprache English). \r\n\r\nThe workcamp in Germany, at the industrial control and automation company FESTO in Esslingen, will deal with mechanics, electronics and engineering; the work stay in Finland will include schools and sports facilities enlarging the topics of education, sports and health. The science work stay in Scotland deals with sciences and ecological topics like pollution and global warming; the workstay in Italy with agriculture and  tourism. The final workstay in Estonia deals with media, surveillance and future work places. \r\n\r\nAll these topics are relevant for the speaking parts of European standardised exams at B1, B2/C1 levels and should be achieved in English. The aim for the other languages is that students can speak about themselves, their family, their hobbies, favourite food, holidays and plans for their future to various degrees (basic to A1/A2), so that they feel confident to take language exams and feel at home in intercultural surroundings, and feel prepared to work in the EU-wide job market.\r\n\r\nWe will  document the speaking situations which we create with the help of the experts from The English Academy (TEA). \r\nIn order to experience the learners' viewpoint and to live lifelong learning, some of the teachers will prepare for language tests alongside with students and take them. \r\n\r\nWe will evaluate the project and publish our findings in the DVD \"STEPs taken - What we have achieved\".  It  gives insight into the language situations created. It will be accessible on the e-twinning site  and on the Erasmus+ dissemination platform. The material and the methods applied will be made available in a methods guide published by Diesterweg, and as Open Educational Resources  material.", "http://www.peebleshighschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE03-KA219-013935_2"]]}}}}
