We will collect and peer review good practices that use parks, nature and woods as green learning environments, and more specific for the target group of children between 8 and 14 years with mental and/or mixed impairments and/or learning disorders. Research suggests this target group takes even more advantage of the green environment for non-formal learning and basic and transversal skill development. The aims of the project are (1) to increase the awareness on the stimulants in nature to facilitate non-formal learning, (2) to collect and review existing practices for non-formal learning in Green Learning Environments with the target group, and (3) developing, testing and disseminating a toolbox.Our multinational, interdisciplinary project team comprises four green partners experienced in education in green areas, and six specialised schools for children with special needs, from Slovenia, the UK and Belgium. Through exchanging and peer reviewing existing practices within the participating organisations and other organisations within and beyond the project countries, we will build a database of and report on good practices for Green Learning Environments (Output O1). Based on this review, we will develop 12 educational materials, methods and tools to be included in the Green Learning Environments Toolbox (Output O2). Three country teams will develop the Toolbox, each team including a green partner and the specialised schools. The materials will be tested in one of the other schools involved in the project, and reviewed by the project team. The joint work on the Good Practices Database & Report and the Green Learning Environments Toolbox will lead to joint capacity building with the project partners. Finally, we will compile a Policy Brief (Output O3), stating the advantages of Green Learning Environments for children in general and our target group more specific. The Policy Brief will also include a brief summary of the project and will introduce the materials and outputs developed.The project will involve 125 children with special needs from 6 schools, and 175 staff members from these schools. We will communicate widely and give a lot of attention towards disseminating the results and tools provided by the project through social media, newsletters, articles in local and specialised press, conferences, mailing lists, ... (expected audience: at least 2000). The project will be closed by a Concluding Seminar, which will be held concurrently in the three countries involved (expected attendance: 55 national participants and 15 international participants each) (Multiplier Events E1, E2 & E3). To stimulate interaction between the 3 concurring seminars, we will set up video-conferencing; online streaming (and recording) the conferences makes it possible to expand the audience to people attending online during, or after the conferences. The Policy Brief will be sent out to relevant local, regional, national and European administrations, authorities, expert networks, umbrella organisations, politicians and policy-makers (over 125 addressees expected).

Both schools will use data collected from their student enrollments, retention and achievement figures as well as destination data. In addition observations, feedback and unstructured interviews will be carried out.  Interviews will be conducted with staff and students with a general theme to allow the conversation to develop organically in an informal way to gain as much information as possible.   The partnership expects the impact at participant level will be increased skills relevant in the scientific field for both participating staff and students. The expected impact for the schools involved is to share ideas and good practice.  The project results will be in the form of a documentation/teaching unit and will be made available on the EST server and e-Twinning website. Additionally, there will be a range of measures to inform about the project and maintain its long term impact via social media, websites, press releases and workshops. Over the longer term the project results will be expected improvement in student results, increased retention and more science related higher education and employment destinations. The short term benefits of the project will allow students involved in the learning activity (some from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds) to gain experience abroad in an academic context, enhance their language, practical and transversal skills to improve their further study and employment prospects.  Language skills will be particularly beneficial to the German students as English is the international language of science.", "http://www.salfordcc.ac.uk", "Salford City College", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000353_coordinator"], [2018, "Enseigner l'Ouverture et les Langues Europ\u00e9ennes", "Salford City College", 34912.0, 3, 4, "Since its opening in 2016, the Ernest Ferroul Secondary School has wished to integrate the European dimension into its school project, in order to enable its pupils and teachers to meet the new challenges of a globalized economy. \r\nThis year, a first mobility project has involved 8 pupils and eight teachers, in Spain and in the United Kingdom. This project has established a trans-curricular team and a network of European partner schools, setting the grounds for further enhancement of our international development. \r\nSituated in an attractive part of the French Mediterranean, where unemployment and precariousness are key issues nonetheless, the Ernest Ferroul High School\u2019s ambition is to broaden the horizon of its pupils by offering them a wider range of opportunities, particularly in the vocational fields. \r\nThe objectives are manifold and have been set in compliance with the school project: \r\n- To develop the pupils\u2019 professional, linguistic and cultural skills, to help them build their citizenship skills within the European Union and to challenge social and geographic determinism, which is strongly-felt in the d\u00e9partement of Aude. \r\n- To improve the students\u2019 school results, retention and future employability, by giving them more professional experience. \r\n- To prepare the teachers (namely in Science and vocational subjects) to CLIL in order to prepare the opening of European Sections. \r\n- To improve the teaching skills of the teams through peer to peer exchanges and joint projects with our European partners. \r\n- To improve the curricular offer of the school \r\n- To boost the students\u2019 motivation and the teachers\u2019 well-being. \r\nAfter the success of the first project, the team has settled the grounds for further developments: new staff members have joined the initial team, a new section (Bac Pro ASSP \u2013 Health Care and Child Care) is going to be involved and new destinations are going to be offered (Amurrio and Girona in Spain, Lauterbach in Germany). The next mobility projects will thus involve three languages: English, Spanish and German.\r\nIn Spain: \r\n-Las Palmas de Gran Canaria : 4 student mobilities (two 2nd-year students in \u201cRetail and sales\u201d + two 2nd-year students in logistics)\r\n- Amurrio: 4 student mobilities (four 3rd-year students in Health Care and child care)\r\n- Girona: 2 student mobilities (one 3rd-year student in Logistics + one 3rd-year student in Transport)\r\nIn the United Kingdom:\r\n-Salford \u2013 Greater Manchester-England: 4 students mobilities (four 2nd-year students in \u201cRetail and sales\u201d)\r\nThe Ernest Ferroul Secondary School has already had the privilege of building strong collaboration with intermediary partners (namely the Salford City Council and its twinning committee, the CIFP Cruz de Piedra in the Canary Islands, the IES ZARAOBE in Armurio, Masco Trans Society) who provide invaluable assistance for the pupils\u2019 work placements. \r\nThat support and guidance at each stage of the project guarantee the quality of the work placements, and the variety of the tasks that are set for the students within the framework of each degree. \r\nRegarding the staff work placements, Salford City College as well as the Spanish and German partner schools work with us to set up visits that fit the needs of the French teachers (observing how specific educational issues are tackled or discovering new learning practices). \r\nBy enabling our students to take part in European mobilities during their studies, not only do we help them to gain significantly in terms of linguistic and professional benefits but also contribute to their intercultural awareness as well as their identity and citizenship construction, by changing their perspectives at a European level. Acquiring intercultural skills and better mastering a foreign language will be a strong asset to live, work and succeed within the European Union.\r\nErasmus staff mobilities will also be highly beneficial. By observing class practices and exchanging with European counterparts, our staff will discover new ways of teaching or managing a school. These visits will be great opportunities that will contribute to the students and the whole school improvement by adapting these successful practices and implementing them in our own national educational context.\r\nIn the very near future Ernest Ferroul College is to become one of the trade and qualifications campus support schools for the logistics and transport sector. The international dimension will be one of the school\u2019s strengths on which to base our school project and school development strategy.

For us, real life experience in a host country seems to be an excellent way for students to learn and build professional, language and intercultural skills. These work placements will also contribute towards increased prestige in the students\u2019 academic careers and therefore help their integration into higher education or employment.\r\nBy enabling students to participate in mobility actions during their studies we give them the possibility to better understand the European Union and to exercise their European citizenship. The capacity to build representations of their partners\u2019 cultures and identities as well as their own culture can lead them to a better understanding of the divergence between the Other\u2019s reality and their own perception, therefore gaining perspective on their own identity references.\r\nAcquiring intercultural skills is an undeniable asset in learning foreign languages and the building of ones own citizenship and capacity to live and work in the European Union.\r\n- Mobility of staff to discover other teaching systems as well as learning languages and improving relationships with public and private partners.\r\nThe staff involved (teachers, education staff, administrative staff) will do \"job shadowing\" which will enable them to discover other ways of teaching or managing a school.

This facility would be the first of its kind in the world and would represent a significant advance for metallurgy. The novel technology that enables this HTT facility is based on automated, direct laser deposition (DLD). The key feature of this technology is the way in which a mixture of elemental powders is accurately and directly fed into the laser's focal point, heated by the laser beam, and deposited on a substrate in the form of a melt pool, which finally solidifies to create a unique fully-dense alloy button with precise stoichiometry. This robotic alloy synthesis is 1000 times faster than conventional manual methods. Once produced, these discrete mm-sized samples are submitted to a range of automated, standardised tests that will measure chemical, physical and mechanical properties. The vast amount of information will be recorded in a 'Virtual Alloy Library' and coupled with computer codes such as neural network models, in order to extract and map out the key trends linking process, composition, structure and properties. The most promising alloy formulations will be further tested, patented and exploited by the 20 end-users. Industrial interests include: (i) new lightweight fuel-saving alloys (<4.5 g/cm3) for aerospace and automotive applications; (ii) new higher-temperature alloys (stable>1000\u00b0C) for rockets, gas turbines, jet-engines, nuclear fusion; (iii) new high-Tc superconductor alloys (>30K) that can be wire-drawn for electrical applications; (iv) new high-ZT thermoelectric alloys for converting waste heat directly into electricity; (v) new magnetic and magnetocaloric alloys for motors and refrigeration; and (vi) new phase-change alloys for high-density memory storage.
