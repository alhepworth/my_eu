The reason for this is our experience that the arts and crafts haven\u00b4t been prioritized at schools during the recent years, though the industry and commerce want people entering employment to show powers of innovation, initiative and problem solving. We also felt that many young people today don\u00b4t know much about their own culture or the culture in the countries of Europe.\r\nThe aim of our project \"Learn, Create, and Communicate\" is to improve our pupils key competences like cultural awareness and expression, ICT-skills, and communication. We  focus on how to teach our pupils to learn in a more creative way so they can develop their basic academic skills, learn to foster their creativity and to cooperate with others.\r\n\r\nWe are six schools in Denmark, Iceland, Germany, Spain, Italy and Wales who will participate in this project. We represent many different skills like experience in project coordination,  e-twinning, ICT-skills, inclusive approaches and  evaluation practices. Our approximately 4000 pupils come from various backgrounds and the size of the schools span from 120 to 1700 pupils. We represent six different languages in Europe.  We believe that our pupils will benefit greatly from the opportunity of working collaboratively with pupils across Europe. \r\n\r\nThe project \"Learn, Create and Communicate\" will last for three years.  The common theme for all three years is  creativity in learning and teaching. The first year we  will focus on learning about cultures and learning to cooperate. Pupils will look at the culture of their own country and then make conceptions and comparisons of the cultures in the partner countries. Through activities like exchanging the Culture Box, sewing and collecting a Culture Quilt and singing the Project Song we will invite our European partners into our hearts and begin feel united.  We learn to cooperate through games, plays, cooking, sport and making an animation film during the first Learning Activity  in Denmark.\r\nThe second year has focus on creativity and art. We will create contacts with the local artists, art schools and creative companies and look at how creative thoughts can be fostered and used. The teachers will have focus on teaching basic skills in creative ways like using animated learning, movement, music and ICT-skills. We will learn about famous artists in the partner countries and exchange pieces of art produced by pupils during our second Learning Activity in Germany. These will be used for an exhibition in \"Kinder Kunst Gallerie\" in Wiesbaden, where the pupils will also work closely with artists as art teachers and get inspired.\r\nThe third year of our project is about communication. Activities like \"Fifty-word-play\" and \"A Day in My Life\", will challenge the pupils to find creative ways to communicate. The teachers will exchange materials for teaching languages.  Our third Learning Activity in Italy has focus on communication through Virtual Classrooms and and learning basic vocabulary in the languages of the partner countries by working with production of a common on-line dictionary.\r\n\r\nOur project aims not only to develop the skills of the pupils but also the skills of the teachers. All teachers participating the project will have a possibility to develop their ICT-skills and get inspired teaching \"Early English\", as each of the six project meetings will include sessions of sharing best practice.  All partner schools will work jointly to produce a book  \"Inspiring Ideas for Teaching Basic Skills\" . This book will be published on the internet and it will be accessible for all interested in teaching. We also intend to arrange a Multiplier Event in Iceland sharing our work through practical examples and work shops with teaching professionals beyond our project.\r\n\r\nWe will communicate, collaborate and share project results through e-twinning and our project webpage.\r\nOur goal is that our pupils will develop their basic skills including language competences, and learn to solve problems and tasks in a more creative way. Learning this they will become more proactive, employable and responsible citizens who are able to make a positive contribution to making a better Europe.", "http://www.mrhianedd.conwy.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DK01-KA219-004268_2"]]}}}}
