Our young people will be facing a very different landscape for employment in 10-20 years when our youngest pupils in primary school enter the world of work. Digital skills are becoming more and more central to teaching and education policy in particularly developed countries are preparing pupils for the Digital Economy. Digital Competency/Literacy Frameworks are in place for strategic development of digital competency across schools. \r\nThis project t takes the role of digital competency to the next level and seeks to engage schools and pupils involved in innovative curricular activities and training for this 4th Industrial Revolution. The project will up-skill teachers to be confident and competent to deliver and embed the skills of programming and coding of robots.  Teachers will work alongside industry standard experts (Big Learning Company - BLC)to use LEGO\u00ae Education Mindstorms EV3 platform and programming languages such as Python. Teachers will develop with BLC experts appropriate training resources for other teachers, a training pack for pupils and creative curricular resources/parental engagement activities for teachers and pupils to use and for other to access too.  We will also carry out a baseline assessment to measure attitudes and values toward Digital Learning with pupils, teacher and parents/carers.  This is followed up by an impact assessment to measure the impact of actions and activities on the targeted group. \r\nThe impact of these Intellectual Outputs and activities developed will be also be evaluated during the project through actions such as lesson observations and feedback from users of the resources and pupil voice on their experiences of being trained as deliverers and educators. \r\nDuring the project, we will include training sessions, two pupil exchanges and four multiplier events. In the 2 distinct phases of the project our overall aim is to up-skill teachers and pupils and involve parents/carers in understanding how digital learning takes place in the school and for them to sample digital learning activities.  The finale of the project will be a collaborative and simultaneous programmed robot dance involving all partner schools using the same dance movements.  This will result in a pan Europe Robot Dance which we plan to broadcast.\r\n\r\nOur participants are:\r\n2 Local Authorities\r\n2 Teacher training/Support for School Development Centres\r\n1 Small/medium enterprise (SME) expert at new technologies\r\n7 schools\r\nThe results/impact of the project:\r\n\u2022 Improved digital skills for teachers, pupils and parents/carers\r\n\u2022 Increased uptake of STEM activities by young people\r\n\u2022 Professional development in 21st Century skills for teachers\r\n\u2022 Improved quality of Digital technology/STEM related lessons through new resources developed\r\n\u2022 Embedding of Digital Skills such as programming/coding in a range of lessons\r\n\u2022 Improved outcomes for pupils in supporting ET2020 targets\r\n\u2022 Improved skills for future employment for pupils", "http://www.npted.org/schools/primary/central", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036581_8"]]}}, "1YY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Formaci\u00f3n Europea y desarrollo profesional del profesorado", "Ysgol Hendre", 13836.0, 3, 5, "EUROPEAN TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHERS\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\nThe HUELIN Secondary School in Malagais carrying out a CLIC programme. It has ICT provision, IT assistant initial voca courses with experience in Computer and participation in European programs. These features convey constant and demanding challenges to maintain quality levels to ensure continuous improvement in the linguistic , technological, educational and internationalization fields.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES , PARTICIPANTS AND METHODOLOGY\r\nTraining of teachers in this project arise through two strategies :\r\n\r\nA1 . MOBILITY TRAINING\r\nCourse ETI ( Exacutive Training Institute - Malta) on the enrichment of learning through technological tools which will last two weeks.Four participants are proposed from different areas:  Spanish Language , Music, Economics , Computer Information Systems.\r\n\r\nA2 . JOB SHAWODING\r\nA2.1 Golborne High School ( UK) : 15-day visit of Spanish language teacher in groups of junior high .\r\nIt seeks to implement , adapting to the characteristics of our students , the teaching of Spanish as a second language , although students are Spanish in groups of special Attention to Diversity , since their levels of reading efficiency are so low that it will impossible to use the usual books and materials.\r\n\r\nA2.2 Penair School and Velindre Community School ( UK) : two-week visit (one per center) of the Therapeutic Education teacher .\r\nA study of protocols , intervention analysis , curriculum design , methodology, and lesson plans for students with various disabilities as autistic pupils, pupils with profound and multiple learning, emotional and behavioral difficulties will be researched .\r\n\r\nA2.3 Helsinki Vocational College , ICT Institute ( Finland) :  four weeks visit of  initial vocational teacher that teaches modules of the same professional group in PCPI .\r\nThe visit aims to study and get the keys to the didactic models in the Finnish vocational training among the student , school officials and companies much closer to what we know in our country, and is expected to get ideas for achieving the objective of covering this approach need to the student as an apprentice to the business sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPACT\r\nSome of the skills as learning outcomes  expected to be acquired by the participants are:\r\n\r\n* Enrichment of Information and Communication Technologies ( ICT) in teaching and learning  by supporting education and ICT -based assessment\r\n\r\n* Adaptation of knowledge and methodology to the needs of the weakest students with adaptation difficulties in the first course.\r\n\r\n* Creating guiding activities to bring students to the professional reality expanding the dissemination of work done with new media and creating alliances with partner companies in the teaching of vocational training.\r\n\r\n* Improvement of the foreign language\r\n\r\n* Increase opportunities for professional development.\r\n\r\nLONG TERM BENEFITS\r\nIntegration of these skills acquired in the classroom and in the center, and their dissemination at all levels . The following improvements are proposed:\r\n\r\n* The willingness to transmit the new techniques learned within the community to use them in a comprehensive and unified manner for students' improvement.\r\n\r\n* Our school will have a stronger network of contacts to facilitate the implementation of European projects , such as e- twinning and KA2 school partnerships that will enhance the European dimension, as our management team wants to strenghthen our international partnership.\r\n\r\n* The center will have more resources to deal with SEN students with, particularly disruptive , or immigrants with social, emotional and behavioral problems , which are often not adapted or integrated into mainstream classes.\r\n\r\n* Through the dissemination plan colleagues will  know the benefits of an experience like this , and may take some of the new ideas and materials in both high school classes as in VET .\r\n\r\nIn short , it is worth noting that these activities will  promote an atmosphere that encourages the staff and motivate the center within a more modern and dynamic professional environment , willing to integrate good teaching tecniques, new teaching methods and practices in daily activities , to integrate teacher professional development and objectives in order to enhance the quality of our school .", "http://www.npted.org/schools/primary/velindre/Pages/default.aspx", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA101-001352_3"]]}}}}
