The project provides the following components of international professional management competency:\r\n+ expand / deepen the knowledge of foreign languages\r\n+ apply professional knowledge in a foreign company and learn new working-methods\r\n+ acquire intercultural competence\r\nAs a vocational school we train for various professions of business, technical, socio-educational fields and the field of care. Our school also has \u201cProduktionsklassen\u201d. These students also should get - as disadvantaged - the opportunity to participate in a learning mobility. For the trainees who gain the additional qualification \"European businessman/-woman\" the participation is obliging. \r\nFor the first time we would also provide this opportunity for apprentices who have completed their vocational training and have not yet participated in a mobility. \r\nIn total for the BBS Osterholz-Scharmbeck (also for 5 other vocational schools in the region) applies for 271 mobilities for 2 years, including 8 to the disadvantaged students. 12 teachers will accompany them and the  groups with minors.\r\nAs a model school for a mobility centre for the school district L\u00fcneburg, a project of the Ministry of Education in Lower Saxony, we support vocational schools which have carried out up to now only a few or no mobilities. They are part of our project and will send students of the socio-paedagogical area, electronics engineers, hairdressers, retail dealers, wooden technology, all together 95 delegations.\r\nIn order to promote the internationalization of initial vocational training, it is important to improve the skills of trainers and teachers. So we offer the possibility for learning stays and working stays. In addition to individual mobilities that deal with methods and concepts to improve vocational education and training systems, we will send a group of teachers. As a mobility center, we want to send teachers to the NL  to deal with the objectives, procedures and methods of vocational training and to prepare concrete mobilities for their students. Through the individual mobilities we want to strengthen the strategy of internationalization of the respective vocational school and improve the language skills. Their absence in school is a reason for the restraint of teachers to implement mobility projects. 28 people will participate in these activities. A further aim is to create a mobility orientated curriculum for participation of Lower Saxony vocational schools.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2 \u2013 6- week stays most trainees will complete a vocationally orientated language training and do an internship, some will make the internship at the foreign branch of their training companies and together with an English college we plan to perform a school-based program for two groups.\r\nIn addition to the job-related activities, the participants will cover the following topics in the placement companies:\r\n+ Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other the resources.\r\n+ Create professional biographies of employees\r\nWe expect the participants to gain an increase in technical and methodological skills, and also in interpersonal skills and a strengthening of intercultural competence. Further we expect as a result that they\r\n+ improve their language skills and in terms of job-related use.\r\n+ can compare the procedures in the foreign company with the processes within their company.\r\n+ are more motivated for their profession and the type of school they attend. This might prevent early school-leaving.\r\n+ know what a company can do to reduce greenhouse emissions and work resource-efficiently.\r\n+ e.g. care \u2013 apprentices improve their understanding of care and demonstrate a respectful and social behaviour.\r\n+ e.g. in the area of social-pedagogic they get to know concepts of the partner institutions and work accordingly.\r\n\r\nFor the implementation, we have developed a coordinated project management of 9 work-packages. The expected results correspond to the above specified components of international professional management competency and are evaluated with different instruments.

It also gives us a competitive edge compared to upper secondary education in colleges providing general education. Continuation in creating this international profile is crucial. Hence we have extended our international educational programme in 2015. The additional qualification (\"European management assistant\" - EMA) for apprentices (industrial mangement assitants) is designed to assure international and intercultural qualification: The apprenteces attend additional courses about international business processes (such as international marketing, basics of international trade and contracts, law of international sale contracts, shipping documents and foreign payment transactions), and acquire certificates: ECDL-Base, certificats of foreign language competence (Englisch (at least B1, intended B2) and French or Spanish (at least A2). They are also obliged to go abroad for a 3-week internship.\r\n\r\nSignificant targets are ...\r\n1) ... for learners: improving their chances on the labour market by providing the additional qualification (\"EMA\") and testing/improving developed  instruments for recognition (especially Europass mobility and ECVET) for work placements in that context.\r\n2) ... for teachers: strengthening existing cooperations and hence putting the international orientation of our college on firm footing, especially by qualifying more colleagues in the execution of work placements abroad, exchange programmes and international projects, discover new impulses for their teaching and share them in teacher conferences for further improvement of our educational programmes. \r\n\r\nAll apprentices enroled for the \"EMA\" programme  are obliged to complete a 4-week work placement abroad. In 2017 there are 31 apprentices aiming to obtain this qualification.  Additionally 10 interested apprentices in other educational programmes will be offered to participate in a commercial 2-week-internship. Teachers who will be chosen for staff mobility are either already teaching in the Europakaufmann (\"EMA\") or EBBD (European Business Baccalaureate Diploma) programmes or seek to teach in these programmes or want to contribute to the internationalization of our college in another way, e.g. by creating new exchange programmes or projects of cooperation.\r\n\r\nAs all apprentices currently enroled for the \"EMA\" programme are apprentices as industrial management assistants their work placements will also fulfill their training regulation. Our partners (CSCS, Principia School of language, partnership international, StageinSpain, Stage Malta) are able to provide work placements accordingly and will ensure on-site monitoring. They will also arrange accomodation and necessary support.  Activities reports will reflect the students' learning progress and will be sent to the German teacher responsible for that project. We will test using etwinning in this context.  The students will reflect on their mobility by using an evaluation sheet based on ECVET criteria, stating the learning outcomes they will have achieved during their stay. These evaluation sheets will be discussed with their mentors and recognized by them.

So far we were able to establish networking and cooperation to Sweden, Norway, Italy, Spain, Ireland, England, Finland, Poland, Croatia and Hungary.\r\nA small project is the cooperation to Norway. It says GeNo-media . The cooperation provides that Norwegian trainees come to Germany and learn printing techniques in three weeks. The BBS II G\u00f6ttingen is a specialist in this area and has an excellent Department of printing technology. In return, German apprentices go to Norway, where they learn audio and video technology. In sound and video technology can unfortunately only be breathe pure. This topic is very extensive and is taught in Norway one year. Both partners thereby increase their competence and quality of education. This is the Norwegians but also the Germans for good.\r\nMove-G\u00f6ttingen is our biggest project. It exchanges trainees, trainers and education staff. The length of stay in Germany or an EU country move from four weeks to six months. The cooperation exists between businesses, schools and universities from Germany and the EU. The German University of G\u00f6ttingen sends trainees in the field of natural sciences in universities or hospitals of Europe. A similar approach companies from S\u00fcdniedersachsen. They aim trainers, trainees and training staff to educate and train. Here, the participants will get to know other methods. In addition, this promotes key qualifications in social skills, language skills and intercultural competence. This is not a one-way street. This is currently only in professional training for biology, chemistry or physics laboratory that. This apprenticeship does not exist in other EU countries. The finished laboratory technicians from Germany therefore have a large labor market. You will be gladly taken as professionals in EU countries. Initial experience this, we have made in Sweden. So it happened that a student is gone after their examination in January 2015. Sweden to the University of Uppsala. She now works at the Institute, where she had her internship. We see this as a great success.\r\nGreen School is a new project also between several scientific schools in Europe. The participants meet once a year in small groups and work together. There are also individual trainees and training staff to be replaced. So the project is to come and stay in each school at the same level. It is constantly being developed and expanded. A goal should be to find cheap drugs for developing countries based on natural ingredients. These can then, for example, are produced in countries with little effort itself. There's a little bit of thought \"medicines for all\" behind it. Each participating country has special herbs that grow only there. These herbs are cultivated in gardens themselves, researched and studied. The ingredients of the herbs to be analyzed. Also important are the action spectra of the herbs, so that they can be recovered economically.\r\nEurope is to grow together and it can be set right with the youth. The positive experience already gained young people at the beginning of their working life will change the setting to a common Europe.\r\nThe trainees will build on their language and human competencies and acquire new professional action competence. Thus, the trainees will not lose the connection at the school. With the new media (moodle) the school will offer modules to the trainees. These need to be developed and uploaded again, so that the vocational teachers can check the success of learning. In this way we also during the internship a learning purpose. In addition, the trainees will continue their record books, as indeed their only place of learning has changed.

The practical rele-vance of the apprenticeship is ensured during the vocational training by firmly inte-grated work experience placements in companies in Bremen and also by the opera-tion of international training firms. Our objective is the institutionalisation of work ex-perience programmes in the target languages of English, French and Spanish (roughly 120 students have chosen either French or Spanish as a second language!). We have always been faced by the problem of dissimilar school structures and inter-ests when searching for partner schools to cooperate with. A Leonardo da Vinci pro-ject for the preparation of work experience provided the opportunity for colleagues at our school to develop devices for the preparation, controlling and evaluation of work experience in a transnational project. Work experience placements have been organ-ised and carried out over the last years in a similar structure but with other responsi-bilities. Most of our students would not be able to participate in a work experience placement abroad were it not for the financial support provided by the Erasmus + Programme.

All students have French or Spanish as a second foreign language (they will have received tuition in one of these languages for at least six or eight school years by the time they sit their final exam). English will have been learnt for eight to ten years. All students have the possibility of acquiring external foreign language certificates. Roughly 40% to 60% of students make use of this opportunity depending on their age group.

Furthermore, work placements abroad are part of the curriculum provided by the Hessian Ministry of Education. They also  meet the requirements of the job profiles of the learners involved in this project: Foreign language assistants and bespoke tailors work in internationally operating companies, social care assistants and students also need intercultural competencies as they will be working with an increasing number of clients with a migrant background. Finally, the shop assistants work in Alsfeld, a European Model Town, with lots of tourists from all over the world.In-service teacher training has a European dimension too and is, therefore, another building block of our profile. In the past activities took place in Finland, France and Denmark.The overall aim of this project is based in the development of personal competencies of the learners. Flexibility, initiative, resilience, cultural open-mindedness and  a tolerance for ambiguity are being promoted. Also, promoting the foreign language competencies, especially listening and speaking skills, is essential. Foreign language assistants need skills in reading and writing as well. With regard to the vocational competencies, the placement  functions as a link, i.e. a connecting activity between the first and the second course year. The learners apply what they have learned in school and thereby expand their skills and competencies through practical work in the placement companies. The political dimension of the project can be found in its close connection to the European labour market. It is an opportunity to experience European mobility.The overall objective in teacher training is staff development following to-date standards. The teacher in question is to enhance her competence profile, i.e. her didactic skills and teaching methods and to improve her job opportunities within the Max-Eyth-SchuleAll in all 38 students and one teacher are involved in this project. The average age is between 18-20 years. Most participants have left secondary school with a GCSE-school leaving certificate.All students complete their placements in companies, however, in each country we cooperate with local vocational colleges. It is their task to provide placement companies and host families, to organize induction courses (UK only) and, eventually, to act as contact persons for our students.A team of teachers who bear responsibility for the respective target groups supervise the project. The project management follows a proven and documented routine. Essential stepping stones are as follows: information, application and election of participants, foreign language, intercultural and organizational preparation, monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of results. The results are then used by second-year students for their own preparation.According to the overall aims of the project, its outcome and effect are expected in the promotion of intercultural capacity, self-confidence and resilience of the participants. Regarding the vocational competencies the full-time students will have applied their acquired theoretical knowledge in a practical environment. They learn to immerse quickly into a foreign business and social context and they will be able to make use of this experience in their professional career. Finally, with regard to  foreign language learning we note that most students develop better listening skills. They are also able to improve their fluency.The certificate the students receive at the end of their placements (Europass Mobility, reference letter) is the immediate benefit the students gain from the project. It will certainly enhance their opportunities on the labour market. Furthermore, placements at an early age are formative for their later lives. The students may develop a positive attitude towards Europe in general and their host country in particular.The immediate benefit of the teacher training study visit is its disseminator effect on other teachers and on the students, eventually.

We also hope they will further promote mobility activities for learners, increase their motivation and statisfaction in their daily work. A considerable boost of innovation is induced by participation at EfVET conferences (see vgl. http://www.efvet.org/), which is why we want to go to this year's conference in Porto. \r\n\r\nBesides EBBD in our upper secondary vocational education department we agreed upon mobility activities with one major local employer, BASF: apprentices for industrial clerks will work as interns in the social sector in order to gain soft skills in other areas than the ones provided by their professional background. That is why the project is called BRIDGES. This will be a first step towards increasing mobility of apprentices in our college. In this case we rely on partners in UK (Principia School for Language/Worcester and Sussex Downs College near Brighton) which are well experienced and connected to local chambers of commerce and companies, provide fitting work placements in the social sector and secure safe accomodation in host families. It is planned for 24 apprentices. Like CSCS with EBBD they will support, monitor and certify the students' work placements, newly implementing ECVET elements in this process. This mobility's focus is on developing personal and social competences as well as intercultural competences which could not be achieved during the students' apprenticeship. Besides students will increase their foreign language competences and employability. This also applies for the 4 students' EBBD work placements, who will be gaining initial work experiences abroad.\r\n\r\nAs our college does not have any experiences with work placements abroad yet, one teacher shall be trained at CSCS, job shadowing well experienced trainers and discussing the used instruments (matching tools, language and intercultural preparation, monitoring and certification of the mobilities according to ECVET instruments/Europass). Due to the ambitious standards which have to be met in EBBD (especially CLIL for working in companies (presentation, participation in meetings) and training of intercultural competences) and the extension/adjustment of CLIL-lessons at our college in this context, job shadowing of teachers in Copenhagen (IBB programme of Niels Brock Business College), in Vienna (International Business College Hetzendorf) and Hungary (Andr\u00e1ssy Katolikus K\u00f6z\u00e9piskola) are planned. \r\n\r\nWe want to achieve the implementation of newly acquired skills in EBBD-classes and bilingual programmes, the implementation of innovative teaching techniques whereever possible, sharing of experiences with colleagues and long-term fostering contacts with partner organizations, especially mentors, intercultural awareness \u2013 also for foreign students living in Germany  - (changing mind sets and attitudes), promotion of  mobility among both student and colleagues, encouraging more students to choose vocational instead of general upper secondary education because it provides better preparation for the job market and encouraging more students to go abroad for work placements, thus increasing their labour mobility, educating with more regard to international orientation and especially European participation based on the teachers\u2019 own experiences - creating awareness of European Citizenship and inducing more cross country cooperation.", "http://info@principia.eu.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000345_7"], [2014, "Auslandspraktika an der Max Eyth Schule Alsfeld", "Principia School of Language Ltd.", 28627.0, 3, 3, "The need for this project is based on the professional requirements in each target group.

Furthermore, work placements abroad are part of the curriculum provided by the Hessian Ministry of Education. They also  meet the requirements of the job profiles of the learners involved in this project: Foreign language assistants and bespoke tailors work in internationally operating companies, social care assistants and students also need intercultural competencies as they will be working with an increasing number of clients with a migrant background. Finally, the shop assistants work in Alsfeld, a European Model Town, with lots of tourists from all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of this project is based in the development of personal competencies of the learners. Flexibility, initiative, resilience, cultural open-mindedness and  a tolerance for ambiguity are being promoted. Also, promoting the foreign language competencies, especially listening and speaking skills, is essential. Foreign language assistants need skills in reading and writing as well. With regard to the vocational competencies, the placement  functions as a link, i.e. a connecting activity between the first and the second course year. The learners apply what they have learned in school and thereby expand their skills and competencies through practical work in the placement companies. The political dimension of the project can be found in its close connection to the European labour market. It is an opportunity to experience European mobility.\r\n\r\nAll in all 13 students are involved in this project. The average age is between 18-20 years. Most participants have left secondary school with a GCSE-school leaving certificate.\r\nAll students complete their placements in companies, however, in each country we cooperate with local vocational colleges. It is their task to provide placement companies and host families, to organize induction courses (UK only) and, eventually, to act as contact persons for our students.\r\n\r\nA team of teachers who bear responsibility for the respective target groups supervise the project. The project management follows a proven and documented routine. Essential stepping stones are as follows: information, application and election of participants, foreign language, intercultural and organizational preparation, monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of results. The results are then used by second-year students for their own preparation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the overall aims of the project, its outcome and effect are expected in the promotion of intercultural capacity, self-confidence and resilience of the participants. Regarding the vocational competencies the full-time students will have applied their acquired theoretical knowledge in a practical environment. They learn to immerse quickly into a foreign business and social context and they will be able to make use of this experience in their professional career. Finally, with regard to  foreign language learning we note that most students develop better listening skills. They are also able to improve their fluency.\r\n\r\nThe certificate the students receive at the end of their placements (Europass Mobility, reference letter) is the immediate benefit the students gain from the project.

Foam packaging is an essential part of the food processing and transport process to prevent damage and spoilage. However, they are made from synthetic polymers and have low density (50 kg/m3) which makes them difficult to recycle economically.
