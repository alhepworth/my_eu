The project  supports the development of a whole school ethos that recognises the school within the wider world and the importance of equality and diversity. It will will enrich the educational practices in school and improve educational outcomes for our children and families. \r\n\r\nWe aim to develop our curriculum, establish links with the school in Spain, enrich our current provision through extending our teaching into Key Stage I and develop our learning environment. We also hope to ensure positive engagement in different cultures, develop new teaching methodologies and develop our whole school ethos promoting diversity, fairness, inclusion and equality.\r\n\r\nWe will improve our teachers' language knowledge and cultural awareness and also improve their teaching skills through having five members of staff take part in training courses in Spain.\r\n\r\nThese training courses will involve intensive language learning and intercultural immersion, building a link with the school in Spain and observing best practice there leading to a link between our schools, and the development of new and effective teaching styles.\r\n\r\nThe visit to Spain would be taken by our MFL co-ordinators for Key Stage I and Key Stage 2 and members of the Subject Leadership Team, teaching and support staff.\r\n\r\nThese members of staff will focus on increasing their skills and developing a strong and productive link with the Spanish school. They will actively disseminate the results of their visits and the skills and competences gained to the rest of the staff, and the whole school will be involved in developing the link with the Spanish school.\r\n\r\nThis will result in skilled staff teaching high-quality lessons leading to an improvement in attainment. We will develop our curriculum so that international learning will be embedded and be part of genuine classroom practice, and extend our teaching of languages further. We will establish parental and community involvement in our Spanish club and develop a workshop programme for parents and children.\r\n\r\nOther outcomes will include the achievement of the International School Award and the Equality award,  improved learning environments and better use of resources including ICT, an increase in international events and an improvement in our staff's professional profile.\r\n\r\nWe will share the results of this project and the benefits gained by our staff and children in many different ways.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefits will include languages being fully established as an important subject in school, children developing an enthusiasm for languages which they will take with them into secondary school, increased involvement of parents and community and a well-trained, effective staff with excellent skills.", "http://Www.partingtonprimary.com", "Partington Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002003_coordinator"]]}}}}
