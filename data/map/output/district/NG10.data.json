In March 2016 a resolution of the European Parliament was published. This resolution request, from the European Union, sought for equality and against discrimination of LGBTI- people: \u201cIn a key report (\u2026) on Gender mainstreaming in the work of the European Parliament, the European Parliament made a strong call to include \u2018the rights, perspectives and well-being of LGBTIQ people\u2019 in all gender mainstreaming activities.\u201dThe relevance and challenges of these issues are evident on different levels: nationwide controversy about the incorporation of the topic of homosexuality into school curricula, the controversial discussion about the implementation of gay marriage, homophobic attacks and bullying (particularly at a young age), the outing of and dealing with homosexual migrants, homophobic behavior in sport, homophobic legislation of LGBTI-people in Russia and likewise many African countries, with images published and distributed by the mass media helping fuel it further.The aim of this project is to make a contribution towards better understanding homosexuality. This is true equally for the areas of tertiary as well as secondary education. Taking a cross-sectoral approach, cooperation between eight countries is proposed for the project, with one university and one secondary school participating from each country respectively. The project thus addresses students and lecturers at teaching colleges and universities, teachers in secondary education and students at secondary schools. Greater understanding is hoped to be achieved through resources which will be created by the project team and then implemented, tested and evaluated within the relevant institutions.A comprehensive assessment and a comparative study is to be published, including images related to homosexuality in the participating countries, and the mission, aims and content of gender-appropriate behaviors in schools (for example: the topic of homosexuality in the training of teachers, in curricula and teaching resources for secondary schools) and of complementing non-school initiatives in other educational institutions. A curriculum module \u2018Gender & Homosexuality\u2019, covering general diversity of lifestyles, sexual identities, the question of coming-out and sexual well-being, is to be established across target groups and will form the basis of a school project over a period of several days. In addition, curriculum module \u2018Migration & Homosexuality\u2019 taking into account the problematic situation of refugees in Europe will be developed. Implementation and evaluation is planned to take place in all participating secondary schools in the third year of the project.During the project a Knowlegde-Portal will be created. All developed resources will be integrated in this portal. An e-learning-portal, the project website, a news-portal etc. will be part of the Knowlegde-Portal.A conference during the third year will bring the project to a conclusion. The resources will continue to be available (indefinitely and without limitation); through the development of applications thus their transparent dissemination is ensured far beyond the duration of the project itself.The project intends to make an active contribution towards establishing intercultural dialogue towards gender equality, and, last but not least, acceptance and better understanding of homosexuality. Apart from its comprehensive geographical reach across the diverse historic backgrounds of the partner countries, the project is enriched especially by our Turkish partner. Cultural differences in the \u2018West\u2019 are manifest also in gender-specific education and upbringing, in gender-specific interactions and attitudes towards tolerance, diversity, and homosexuality. The participating countries from Eastern Europe will further enrich the project outcomes and activities as their traditions and specific experiences, too, are analyzed and incorporated into our project.", "Http://www.longeaton.derbyshire.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NL01-KA203-022893_11"]]}}, "4QD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Industry 4.0 for wood and furniture manufacturers", "BFM LIMITED", 951091.0, 5, 13, "The furniture and woodworking sectors can benefit from the advantages that Industry 4.0 brings. However, as other traditional sectors, these show a shortage of professionals with high qualification in ICTs and other emerging technologies. Some of the specific skills and competencies that stand out as critical for managers in the furniture sector are ICTs skills that are crucial to operate in a modern business environment.Under this context, the In4Wood alliance is working towards the design, development andrecognition of a Joint Curriculum for filling the skills gaps of productions managers and CEOS of such industries in those relevant Key Enabling Technologies (hereinafter, KETs) from the Industry 4.0. With the support of the the Sector Skills Alliances action from the Erasmus+ programme.Being the project objectives clearly aligned with both the needs of the sector in terms ofsustainability and the main aims of the participant institutions, In4Wood is composed byassociation and bodies representing the furniture and woodworking industries, educationalinstitutions from regions highly influenced by such sectors, authorities in the field of Labour and Vocational Education and Training from Spain, Italy, Germany and UK, and one federation representing regional development agencies from all Europe.During the 1st period of the project, this Sector Skills Alliance has worked in developing a deep desk research and thorough consultation to deliver a clear analysis of the skills needs in the field of Industry 4.0 within the addressed sectors, where sectorial, educational and ICT experts were involved. Results from this first stage were used for building up a common curriculum proposal for manufacturers of smart furniture factories. Such curriculum proposal comprises four different units, which have been described using ECVET principles: Generic title, qualification and its reference to the EQF level, learning outcomes contained, assessment criteria and procedures and the associated ECVET points.The VET providers from the consortium, with the support of the sector experts and VET authorities are currently working in the development of the didactic materials that will compose each unit.These will be deployed in a learning platform to be freely and massive delivered.In4Wood has its own website (www.in4wood.eu) and profiles at the most relevant social media (twitter and linkedin), constituting the main platforms for dissemination activities and containing all public information of the project.

Moreover, one of the key priorities for HE is the reinforcement of the \u201cKnowledge Triangle\u201d, through the support of innovation, entrepreneurship and university-business cooperation. This specifically applies to those traditional sectors, such as the furniture and woodworking sectors, where changes in education and training are required to equip the future workforce with the new skills for the new demands generated by the changing patterns of furniture consumption (e.g.: ageing population/assisted living).Nevertheless, the European furniture sector is a key driver of sustainable growth with a significant contribution to Europe\u2018s overall economic health, competitiveness, creativity, innovation, employment and export: One quarter of the world\u00b4s furniture is produced in the EU. In 2012, more than 900,000 EU workers were employed in approximately 126,000 firms, and production amounted to more than \u20ac84 Billion (1) (figures for each participant country are fully detailed in Partner\u00b4s Description). However, these figures are 13% lower than in 2007, while the Asian market has increased its production to 230% during the same period (2). Staff qualifications along with the ageing workforce and the inability to attract young workers (3) remain one of the crucial points in these industries. To boost the recruitment of highly prepared staff requires initiatives addressing training to make the sector attractive and capable of transforming both the academic knowledge and high-level basic and transversal competences required to be useful and applicable.For these reasons, this Strategic Partnership proposes the creation of a flexible learning pathway in line with the needs of learners and companies in the furniture, woodworking and related sectors. It will provide a joint study program between Higher Education and Vocational Education and Training that will CAPITALISE COMPANIES WITH PREPARED YOUTH, providing enterprises innovation, expertise and added value.IM-FUTURE arises from a Strategic Partnership composed of seven entities from regions that are highly influenced by the furniture and woodworking industry: Four universities, two technical research and Training centres and one furniture industry representatives. With the aim to DEVELOP AN INTERNATIONAL MASTER DEGREE FOR THE FURNITURE SECTOR, which will offer an adapted curriculum to equip the young generation with the specific, basic and transversal competences currently required in the furniture, woodworking and related industries. This international Master Degree will provide students with opportunities to gain additional skills by studying and training abroad.This initiative will comprise of the following activities:-Surveys, comparative analysis and evidence-gathering, studies of real life cases in order to have a real idea of the needs of skills and competences in the European furniture and Woodworking industry.- Development of a joint curriculum with the integration of different learning modes (distance, face to face, etc) and innovative approaches.- The creation of learning and training materials together with methods, pedagogical approaches and tools.- Capacity buildings and networking activities.As a final result of these activities this Strategic Partnership will develop a Study Report on current skills needs on the European Furniture and Woodworking industry, a Joint Curriculum together with a learning content and an e-Learning platform that will be freely and widely distributed. 4 Multiplier Events are planned at the end of the project.IM-FUTURE will trigger modernisation and reinforce education aligned to the needs and opportunities offered by traditional industries. It will provide, assess, and look for the recognition of basic skills needed in the furniture and wood working sector. IM-FUTURE will also address transversal skills, such as entrepreneurship, foreign languages and digital competences.HE students and staff, and also everyone involved in the development of this initiative will have the chance of increasing their sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, their competences in foreign languages and, of course, increasing their skills and capabilities for employability in a industrial sector which is the main key driver in many European regions.----(1) Data from Eurostat SBS Eurostat, (sbs_na_ind_r2).(2) Source: CSIL processing of data from official sources: Eurostat, UN, National Statistical Offices, National Furniture manufacturersassociations (e.g. China National Furniture Association, Amedoro, Japan Ministry of Finance, Japan Ministry of Economy, Trade andIndustry).

However, while these statements are made with real intent the data suggests that a great deal more needs to be done if the barriers to employment for people living with disability are to be eliminated.Currently much good work is being done to enhance the training received by people living with disabilities so they have the skills required to contribute with the labour, but there is less work being done to prepare and support SMEs in their efforts to engage people with disabilities. There is a significant need to ensure that SMEs can face the directives with confidence if the changes for people living with disabilities are to take place.SupportAbility has been created in order to address the gap in resources that currently stops SMEs in the furniture industry being full contributors to the aims of the UNCRPD. Its core aim is to provide resources to ensure that people living with disability can secure long-term employment through SMEs being able to supply the support they require from within the workplace.To this end, the project seeks to gain access to available resources and construct new ones for SME Directors, HR Officers and other managers so they can access the information they need when employing people with disability. In addition, SupportAbility will be creating a curriculum and e-Learning platform for a VET course to train furniture industry employees to be workplace mentors for people living with disabilities, so their peers are ready to give their support as well, especially during the initial phase of transition when entering a new place of work.SupportAbility has six Partner organisations that bring their experience in working with the SMEs active in the furniture industries, implementing VET for these SMEs, advocating for people living with disability, creating e-Learning activities, and analysing social research. The Partners are based across four countries \u2013 UK, Spain, Portugal and Turkey.The method for the project is founded on providing five substantial outputs as resources that can assist in bringing about the results. These will include (1) a report on the current state of affairs for furniture industry SMEs in employing people living with disability with an analysis of their needs. (2) a database providing resources for SME managers that can assist them in employing people with disability. (3) A User Guide to assist them in navigating and applying the database (4) A curriculum for the training of mentors to support people living with disability in the workplace. (5) An e-Learning platform that can be integrated into the implementation of the mentor course. The work will follow in this order, with the work on each output informing the development of the next one. There will also be a set of learning activities that will be included in the curriculum element as an implementation of that curriculum for 12 furniture industry employees to train as mentors.The Partners will be making contact with over 100 different organisations from across the sectors where they are working and engaging with 350-450 participants in order to reach their objectives. The Participants will mainly, though not exclusively, come from the countries where a Partner is located. The participants will take part in surveys, learning activities, as well as other events. They will also be engaged with the work on the project's data-driven analysis of disability in the furniture industry, the gathering of available resources for SMEs and the development of the curriculum for the mentor training.For many SMEs, being able to have a defined strategy to deal appropriately with employees that may also have disabilities will be new. The SupportAbility Partners expect that within furniture industry SMEs, there will be a significant increase in their sense of initiative and entrepreneurship in their approach to recruitment. The outputs will exist to enable SMEs to move past seeing the disability in a candidate for employment so they can engage with them as part of a team while having the confidence to deal with any special needs systemically.Beyond the project's lifetime, SupportAbility can become an example of a practical implementation of the ethical position stated within international directives like UNCRPD and the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. In this context, SupportAbility can bring an increased inter-regional and transnational cooperation between public authorities in their VET commitment on behalf of supporting SMEs seeking to maximise accessibility to their world of work in all its forms.", "http://www.bfm.org.uk", "BFM LIMITED", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA202-024414_coordinator"]]}}, "4QE": {"cordis": {"data": [[1351728000000, 1446249600000, "Additive Manufacturing for Wear and Corrosion Applications", "Etalon Research Ltd", "AMCOR will develop and demonstrate Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) industrial manufacturing systems for the deposition of functional graded coatings (FGM) and 3D features onto metallic components supplied by industry that are subjected to in-service wear and corrosion.
