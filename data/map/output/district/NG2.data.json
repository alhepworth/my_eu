EATS will propose innovative lab. tools providing a model of the on-board ERTMS system, and including the dynamic behaviour of the air-gap comm. and fault injection for the safety assessment. This will lead to reduced laboratory and field-testing certification process time and cost.  In the current economic situation, this is crucial to keep the ETCS deployment speed.\n2. EATS will propose a novel positioning system based on the combination of different techniques proved useful for other industrial sectors and exploit unique features of the railway and the train. Moreover, RAMS analysis and laboratory testing are foreseen to verify the proposed technical solution. This will be a step forward towards ETCS level 3 that minimizes trackside costs and maximizes track capacity.\nThe consortium is clearly concerned about the return to the society of the funding obtained. Dissemination will be done by a web site with open forum, 2 workshops for industry, 2 courses for engineering students, 8 scientific papers, an Advisory Board and contribution to standards.\nThe consortium presents 3 key characteristics to overcome these challenges: world class organizations with successful previous experiences (e.g. CEIT coordinates [TREND], NSL participated in [GRAIL]); it involves technology providers (CEIT, FhG), subsystem integrator (INT), service providers (NSL, ESOL) and Notified Body (CETREN).

The features of the services rely on an accurate and available positioning that will be achieved thanks to the distinguished characteristics for the railway environment of the EGNOS and Galileo multi-frequency multi-constellation signals (e.g. E5 wideband signal with Altboc modulation has high code range precision through reduced code noise and multipath). SIA will build on existing EGNSS based pilot projects such as H2020-ERSAT EAV and H2020-FR8RAIL within the context of Shift2Rail.

More European countries are emphasising the importance of making visible and valuing learning that takes place outside formal education and training institutions, for example at work, in leisure time activities and at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, despite a number of initiatives and recommendations on the recognition of informal learning (c.f. European guidelines for validating non\u2011formal and informal learning, CEDEFOP) there is a wide gap between the recognition of formal and informal or non-formal learning. Access to the recognition of informal learning is patchy and the outcome of recognition process is  too often treated with suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mozilla Open Badges, an initiative launched by the Mozilla Foundation in September 2011, provides a response to the needs for the recognition (formal and informal) of learning (formal and informal).  Open Badges are portable and verifiable, allowing learners to showcase work, document skill sets and competencies, and create a robust portrait of their abilities wherever they were acquired: whether in school, in the community, on the job or online. Millions of badges have already been delivered and the initiative has received the support from leading organisations in the field of education, business, policy and citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe aims and objectives of Badge Europe, BEU (pronounced \u201cBe You\u201d) are to exploit the benefits of Open Badges to:\r\n\r\n- To create the conditions for a Europe-wide and world-wide recognition of learning achievements;\r\n\r\n- To open and facilitate the systematic access to the recognition of non-formal and informal learning;\r\n\r\n- To place formal and informal recognition of learning on a par; \r\n\r\n- To create new employment and learning opportunities for all; and\r\n\r\n- To bring a European contribution to the leadership of the world-wide Open Badge movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nBEU will be developing a network of organisations and practitioners to: \r\n\r\n- Promote the use of Open Badges for the recognition of learning;\r\n\r\n- Develop Open Badge initiatives at institutional/local/city/regional/national levels (e.g. Cities of Learning, developing the example of Chicago Summer of Learning - http://explorechi.org);\r\n\r\n- Promote Open Badges at policy levels;\r\n\r\n- Develop innovative practices in learning and employment; and\r\n\r\n- Make recommendations and implement improvements to the Open Badge Infrastructure, technologies and services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose activities will be carried out directly, with the support of Open Workshops (6) and of a MOOC.

The 4 CME City Pilots are:  1) Arnhem: medium size city, large renewable energy production, large storage in industrial area;\n2) Nottingham: medium size city, large renewable energy production, medium size storage, electric vehicles and bi-directional chargers in a controlled area (depot);\n3) London: large city, large renewable energy production at multiple locations, large storage, electric vehicles and bi-directional chargers in controlled areas with separate grid (depot);\n4) Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd: small city, small renewable energy production, storage facilities and electric bikes in residential area.  The city pilots will utilise different state-of-the art storage media in various environments, which are representative of North West Europe and are easily replicated in other cities across Europe. Specifically in London and Nottingham, for example, electric vehicles themselves will be used to power the buildings and depot by using innovative bi-directional chargers controlled by the integrated energy management system iEMS. In Arnhem, on the other hand, renewable energy will be supplied to ships in the harbour adjacent to its industrial.

Fighting rising levels of unemployment has become one of the most urgent tasks for European governments. Too many young people leave school prematurely and run a high risk of being unemployed. The same risk threatens high number of adult workers with low skills. One quarter of the working age population in Europe, almost 80 million people have only low or basic skills, and a great percent of them area hardly educable or trainable because of different disabilities. Activation of school drop-outs or low-qualified job seekers is a primary field of cooperation in the Public Employment Service (PES) 2020 strategy of the EU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost relevant priorities of the project are contributing to a reduction in the number of low-skilled adults (re-skilling and up-skilling) and developing partnerships between education and employment. Targeted topics are new innovative curricula/educational methods/development of training courses and labour market issues incl. career guidance / youth unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTarget groups:\r\n\r\n1. Unskilled or low-skilled disadvantaged young people and adults between 16-36, who have troubles in finishing/ taking part of trainings in the regular school system as well as of the employment centre, being mentally and/or psychologically unable to follow the usual courses. These persons are excluded from the labour market and belong therefore to a disadvantaged group in social life. Members of the target group are not mentally handicapped, but the social-economic background did not allow them to develop skills, moreover the family and social surrounding often suppresses existing skills and motivation. \r\n\r\n2.Trainers, tutors, teachers of the above mentioned group of young adults.

For employers however, it is not a level playing field the barriers for micro, small and medium sized enterprises are significant and prevent them from taking on apprentices. In the UK less than 10% of SMEs will take on an apprentice compared to a third of large companies who will do so. Given that the consensus, amongst academic studies and labour market experts is that  growth in employment will come from SMEs, there is a danger that these business organisations will not engage with apprenticeships and public investment will not be as effective as it could be.\r\n\r\nThis is what the project will seek to address, it will take good practice from two countries which have good records at assisting SMEs to take on an apprentice, and import this into three who wish to do better.

The Agency is an institution that coordinates the implementation of national policies in the field of vocational education, training and guidance.\r\nUnder the Article 42 from VETA, NAVET has functions which are directly connected to the project proposal topic:\r\n- Licensing of Vocational Training Centers and Centers for Information and Vocational Guidance (for adult learners);\r\n- Supervises the activities and assesses the quality of training (for unemployed and employed)  in licensed institutions in the system of vocational training;\r\n- Prepares annual analyses for the activities of licensed centers and make proposals for improving the vocational training for adults;\r\n- Prepares annual analyses of the self-assessment carried out by VET centers for adults;\r\n- Provides methodological support to the Vocational Training Centers performing validation of professional knowledge, skills and competences of adult learners.\r\nThe participants in the project are experts and manager staff in NAVET, who are responsible for improvement of the national system for vocational education and training, incl. for employed and unemployed persons.\r\nEvery participant who is planned to be a part of the mobility, has an active role in the different working groups with participants from state institutions and other organizations for development and actualization of the national legal framework and strategic documents, connected to the improvement of the access and participation of adults in VET. The participants are also involved in different projects for improving the quality in VET and regarding the opportunities for dual VET for adults. So the project will be useful for the adaptation and transfer of best practices in the national VET system, including trainings for adults which are in need for new innovative methods to answer the actual challenges of the labor market.\r\nThe specific needs of the participants in the project are connected to the research, comparison and adaptation of good practices from related organizations in the following areas:\r\n1) Vocational training for adults;\r\n2) Initiate of quality control systems for the VET centers;\r\n3) Validation procedures and better opportunities for acquiring new qualification.\r\nThe mobility is organized in 2 streams: in Italy - 1 and in the United Kingdom - 1, each of them with 5 days duration.

Axle bearing damage has been the object of intense attention by railway operators and transportation authorities, leading to a variety of approaches and systems currently in place to deal with the problem. However in Europe there is some lack of standardisation which justifies R&D work on condition monitoring and early diagnosis of axle bearings by technology integration. Moreover the current European documents do not present any guidelines for the maintenance management of the rolling stocks with regards to axle bearings, which make the association of monitoring, diagnosis and maintenance an interesting approach.\nThe MAXBE project appears in this context and its strategic objective is to provide validated and demonstrated concepts, strategies and guidelines for the interoperable axle bearing monitoring and diagnosis that support the railway operators and managers dealing with the threats imposed by the existence of axle bearing defects.\nThe consortium for the MAXBE project comprises 17 partners (industry, leading universities, end-users and a SME) from 8 member states, representing operators, axle bearing manufactures, key players in the railway community and experts in the field of monitoring, maintenance and rolling stock. The presence in the consortium of one axle bearing manufacturer, market leader in the field, and three operators and railway managers, as end-users, is decisive for the enhancement and optimisation of the axle bearing diagnosis and maintenance strategies and for the definition of the new proposed approaches for the interoperability.\nThe MAXBE project will have impact for the reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS) of rolling stock and infrastructure, focused on the axle bearings.", 171165.0, 3654683.0, 7, 18, "MAXBE", null, "http://www.krestos.co.uk", null, "fp7_105866_956384111"]]}}, "7QP": {"esif": {"data": [[1467331200000, 1561852800000, "D2N2 Digital Business Growth Programme", "Nottinghamshire County Council", "D2N2 Digital Business Growth Programme will deliver a bespoke, structured business support programme, intensively supporting 852 businesses and developing 39 new businesses with real growth aspirations, to explore and introduce new and emerging ICT products / services to their business to improve competitiveness, productivity, perceptions about ICT\u2019s role in business growth and to take advantage of commercial opportunities \u2013 consequently driving economic growth across the D2N2 area.", "ERDF", 3626318.0, 7252636.0, "erdf_england_185"]]}}}}
