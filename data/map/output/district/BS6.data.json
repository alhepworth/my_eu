The outcomes of the project indicated a great need of continuing and expanding these types of schemes. During the planning stage, the initial group, which included MODM in Bialystok and pre-school institution from Lithuania, was expanded by schools from Western European countries. In addition to aforementioned issues, those institutions struggle with rapid increase in the numbers of pupils, which result from the rise in economic emigration of Poles. The analysis of the needs of target groups of the project showed the following problems: insufficient methodological support, lack of access to new teaching methods, materials, technologies and up-to-date subject knowledge. The project \u2018Polish school abroad\u2019 answers the actual needs of Polish educationalinstitutions abroad.\r\n\r\nMain aims of the project:\r\n- to organize in-service training for Polish teachers abroad in terms of pre-school education and subjects taught in Polish; to improve teaching, psychological, intercultural skills and subject knowledge\r\n- to improve skills of managers of the partner institutions in terms of the educational institution managment \r\n- to create methodological resource pack for Polish overseas teachers, comprised of didactic materials\r\n- to create an in-service teacher training programme that will contain methodological and subject  knowledge\r\n- to create methodical e-learning courses\r\n- to promote the use of ICT in teaching, e.g. through e-learning\r\n- to maintain the national identity of Poles living abroad\r\n\r\nThe participants of the project are teachers and managers of the partner institutions (around 65 participants in total). The project partners are: Municipal Centre of Methodology and Counselling in Bia\u0142ystok (Poland), Kindergartens in Maisiagalos (Lithuania), Polish School in Barcelona and Tarragona, ProPolonia Polish Association for Culture and Education (Belgium), Integrative Saturday School in Bristol (the UK), Polish Saturday School in Moss (Norway). \r\nThe participants will take part in courses, workshops, exchange of experience and good practices, the results of intellectual work elaboration and creating didactic materials. On the part of the coordinator, the participants are employees responsible for preparing and carrying out of the in-service training. E-learning courses and didactic materials will be available for all interested teachers of Polish schools abroad. The in-service teacher training programme can be used by institutions and associations active in the field of Polish overseas education. Indirectly, the project will impact around 400 recipients.\r\nIn order to achieve the aims of the project the partners planned the following activities:\r\n- transnational project meetings, for the management of the project and coordinating the work on the results\r\n- transnational training activities consisting of courses, workshops, exchange of experience and elements of job shadowing\r\n- joint activities of partners to produce intellectual work products of the project including:\r\n* creating e-learning courses, available on Moodle platform administered by the coordinator of the project\r\n* creating the in-service teacher training programme and the resource pack for teachers of Polish schools abroad\r\n- creating the project website, where the products of the project will be made available as Open Educational Resources\r\n\r\nAchieved results, especially the teacher training programme, the resource pack and e-learning courses, will be presented during the seminars and a conference organised at the end of the project. The events will be attended by teachers and employees of associations, organisations and institutions connected with Polish education abroad. The results will be also disseminated through the project website.\r\n\r\nThe project will have significant impact on raising qualifications and developing knowledge and professional skills of the participants.

The school's primary interest is science and mathematics, and it offers the unique practical laboratory work in physics, biology and chemistry throughout all four years of the secondary education. In order to secure even better quality of education, we have decided to start teaching those subjects in English language. We have presented our project to the Croatian Ministry of Education and received their positive comment. \r\nThe school's goal is not only to start teaching the above mentioned subjects in English language, but to improve schooling and bring the spirit of internationalism. The biggest beneficiaries from the project would be our students, who will get the chance to take part in the programme that is unique in Croatia. All this will be done because the school aspires to implement standards in accordance with the general Strategy of education, science and technology as well as to achieve high EU standards of quality education and students' mobility.\r\nIn order to meet this goal, teachers would therefore have to improve their general and subject related English language skills. The teachers will also come across various new subject related materials, which would then later be available to all the staff. Learning about other teaching traditions and ways in Europe will be of great use to all the teachers since they will be able to implement them in their own classes. \r\nNext objective is to produce more teachers who are able to manage projects. This can be achieved by including all the teachers into all the project stages (from developing an idea to the evaluation stage) which leads to increasing every teacher\u2019s confidence to manage a project of its own. This, together with improving the language competence, directly ensures their better position on the job market.\r\nWe have four activities. The first activity consists of two mobilities in Language School International, Cambridge, UK. The mobility part gathers overall ten teachers. Teachers will improve their grammar as well as work on their reading, listening and speaking skills and pronunciation in a controlled environment. They will, of course, also get to become better at knowing subject related terminology.\r\nThe second activity is visiting a partner school - Redland Green School, Bristol, UK which is the base for both our job shadowing and teaching assignment. The plan is to study the way the school functions in general, the way projects are run there and how they are included in the curriculum. Also, a lot can be learnt about the school system in the UK, with special interest in development plan, teaching methods and similar. This will result in improved language skills, skills needed for project management and teaching skills. \r\nThe third activity involves English language workshops organized for teachers of science and math by the English teachers from Vladimir Prelog Science School. This is the way teachers will continually work on developing and improving all the language skills. The workshop classes will also be used for brainstorming in general, identifying the needs of the project, task delegations, preparations for the trips and similar activities. This all will contribute to a good communication and flow of information between all the participants of the project.\r\nAnd finally, the fourth activity is ensuring the project's visibility which is directly affecting project competences of the teachers involved.\r\nThe competences gained throughout the project are to be confirmed by certificates such as: Europass documents (CV, Language Passport, mobility), Croatian Ministry of Education's comment on the idea of the project as well as Cambridge's  FCE test.\r\nThe experiences and information gained through this project will be spread not only during the project, but also after its evaluation phase. Project has many goals so it is of utmost importance to spread the word about the results and the mobilities to as many people as possible.\r\nTeachers of the above mentioned subjects would therefore improve not only their general English language but also very important subject related vocabulary which will enable them to teach in English themselves, while English language teachers will become specialists for science related terms. Quality improvement together with internationalisation is also an important outcome. New and improved teaching methods as well as project management skills will surely lead to greater teachers' mobility. Through this mobility a greater tolerance of students and teachers towards other cultures is also likely to be achieved. Also, cooperation with the partner school will be established which opens the door to further projects. Teachers as well as students will definitely use platforms as eTwinning more in order to carry out online projects and make new partners all over the Europe.", "http://www.redlandgreen.bristol.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-HR01-KA101-012809_1"]]}}}}
