Every participant will develop their language skills, social skills, professional skills, attitude, tolerance, general knowledge and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nIn this project we send 67 students, 5 staff members and 1 working life representative to work based learning periods abroad.  This mean real work in real work places. Additionally we send 7 staff members to visit partner schools abroad. As a new qualitative addition some of the exchange periods are longer, even 10 weks and in one case 32 weeks.\r\n\r\nDuring the work based learning periods both students and staff collect cultural differences ay work places, free time and everyday life.  This information will help next travelers to meet the differences in other countries. Another task during the exchange is about entrepreneurship. Participants have to compare the future changes of techniques and ICT in working life of Finnish and foreign employer. It gives students a possibility to meet and interview company owners and directors of work places and develop their entrepreneurship skills.\r\n\r\nThe project affects students\u2019 employment and the internationality of schools and region. Cultural results of the project can be used when preparing students for future exchange periods. Information of entrepreneurship can be used in education in our schools. All information will be put on our web site for open use.\r\n\r\nWork based learning abroad will be accredited for students. Additionally we give 2-4 extra study weeks for preparation and informal learning during exchange period.", "http://www.westsuffolkcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FI01-KA102-008731_4"]]}, "esif": {"data": [[1483228800000, 1569801600000, "PLACE 21 C", "West Suffolk College", "This is a pilot initiative and breaks new ground.
