Habitat loss and deterioration - especially the reduction in Phragmites reedbeds and similar marshlands which are favoured by this large but secretive bird - are among the chief reasons for its general demise, and for its inclusion in Annex I of the Birds Directive. The recent trend to abandon traditional reed management has contributed to the present situation where the haunting, low, booming call of territorial male bitterns is no longer heard, or is heard less frequently, in many lowland wetlands of north-west Europe.\n\nIn the UK, where the breeding population has dropped from a mid-1950s peak of around 80 booming males to 16 in 1994, the RSPB has prepared a recovery plan for bitterns. This project aimed to take key elements of this plan and put them into action so as to safeguard and enhance core areas of UK bittern habitat.\n\nTo improve the conservation status of this species in Britain, the project would expand the available breeding habitat and improve habitat quality at 13 sites, mostly in East Anglia - the species' current stronghold - and at one outlying site in north-west England. This would be done in partnership with wetland management agencies in both the public and private sectors.\n\nActivities would specifically protect and enhance reedbed habitats; restore degraded reedbed habitats; and create new reedbeds adjacent to existing areas of this habitat. The expected result would be to provide suitable habitat in Britain to support a bittern population that is 2-3 times higher than at present, although it might take longer than the life of the project before the birds take up residence in their improved habitats. Finally, lessons learnt from this project would be shared with other relevant organisations across the EU to assist the implementation of the European bittern action plan.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=119", "http://www.bitterns.org.uk,", "life_179"], [1995, "Natura 2000 sites in Wales - Integrating monitoring with management planning:  a demonstration of good practice on Natura 2000 sites in Wales", "Countryside Council for Wales", 638148.0, 319074.0, "The main objective of this project is to develop a monitoring methodology for all the terrestrial habitat types listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive which are found within the proposed NATURA 2000 sites in Wales. This will include seven 'priority' habitat types, such as fixed coastal dunes, ravine and alluvial forests and yew woodlands, raised and blanket bogs and calcareous fens, plus a further 18 habitat types ranging from sea cliffs, heaths and grasslands, to oak and beech woodlands and open mountain habitats. These habitats occur in a series of 20 potential NATURA 2000 sites throughout Wales, for which monitoring programmes and baseline data will be produced. The final output from the work will be a series of publications on the monitoring methodology and training in its application for the benefit of NATURA 2000 site managers elsewhere in the Community.The effectiveness of the Habitats Directive in ensuring the protection of those habitat types and species of European importance listed in its annexes I and II can only be judged if the habitats and species are monitored adequately. While there already exists some experience on the monitoring of a range of habitat types, no work has, as yet, been undertaken to develop standards for monitoring in support of the Directive. As the network of Special Areas of Conservation (NATURA 2000) will form a vital foundation for the conservation of these habitats and species, it is important that monitoring programmes are developed to determine their favourable conservation status. \n\nBy targeting the proposed SACs in Wales, this project aims to develop a standardised and efficient habitat monitoring programme linked with management plans for NATURA 2000 sites in the Region which can act as a demonstration tool for other areas within the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=64", null, "life_17"]]}}}}
