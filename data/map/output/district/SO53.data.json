La Salle is present in 82 countries where its Educative Mission has been spread at Regional level. As an educative institution, it has recently been subject to major changes regarding national and international organization.In 2010 the organizational, and management structure was modified. The centres became managed by Regions, and within these ones, Districts. Spain belongs to the RELEM Region and forms the District ARLEP (Regional La Salle Grouping for Spain and Portugal in Spanish language).Since then, our centres have been constantly networked. At the mobility level we aim at developing a common Project, a consortium involving students and teachers. We also rely on our own experience in mobility as well as the good work done by Colegio La Salle Virgen del Mar in Almer\u00eda, which will lead the consortium and will boost the various phases of the Project. The objectives of the project1. To respond to the concerns detailed in the Mission Project of La Salle Centres. 2. To create a sub-commission of Mobility for the Network of La Salle Centres in Spain. 3. To systematize the procedures in view of developing mobility projects for students and teaching staff. 4. To optimize the use of technological platforms \u2018Sallenet\u2019 and \u2018Indivisa\u2019 in such a way that they may be used as repositories and respectively, assessment tool and data analysis. 5.

Consequently, the participation to the Erasmus+ project is even more effective in helping the school comply with the new requirements and offering the trainees an invaluable experience that might even steer the beneficiary towards specific future working/training choices. \r\nAlthough the work placement is an important stage of the process of personal growth for the participants, a good project does not confine itself to the period of work experience abroad, but preliminarily it offers preparatory activities at school that cover the whole span of the project\u2019s life. \r\nA qualifying feature of the experience is the planning and testing, rich in content and quality, of the Learning Outcomes Units inspired by the ECVET system and of the agreed upon learning objectives with tools such as the MoU and the LA, both with the traditional partners of the CREDCHEM network and with the ones of the educational and tourist fields, with the purpose of acquiring skills that can be transferred to national and international contexts. \r\nIn order to promote this good practice that can be applied in particular in the context of the Technical school of Chemistry, this year more mobilities will be reserved for the students of the Chemistry branch, consistently with the Key Objectives of ET2020 to make science and technology more appealing while improving one\u2019s language skills, strengthening creativity and innovation as key factors of a sustainable economic development. \r\nHigh quality skills and competences for employability, innovation, active citizenship and welfare, together with transparency and competence and qualification recognition, are explicitly recommended among the 6 priorities of the 2016-2020 period.  \r\nThis important goal is reached thanks to work-based learning provided by the work placements, which have the following objectives: \r\n\u2022 For the Chemistry Technical School: acquiring methodologies and procedures in the field of chemical, biological, biotechnological, environmental hygiene and healthcare analysis; interpreting results and writing reports; using instruments; performing qualitative/quantitative analysis with different methodologies;\r\n\u2022 For the Foreign Languages School: developing multilingual communicative skills in the tourist and cultural fields in hotels, tourist offices, libraries, recreation/cultural centres, universities, museums; collaborating in the organization of events, planning itineraries, managing reservations and quotes; collaborating in an educational team by planning activities relevant to the interests of the participants using one\u2019s communicative skills. \r\nThis project supports the teachers involved as tutors in a process of continuous professional development through projects of teacher mobility (ERASMUS+ CLIL O.W.Ne.R.S. 2016-1-IT02-KA101-022762); this opportunity will be taken this year by some of the tutors that have most recently joined the Erasmus+ team, to improve their teaching competence and language skills as teachers of non-language-related subjects.", "https://www.oxfordinternationalenglish.com/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005740_15"], [2017, "Internacionalizaci\u00f3n de la formaci\u00f3n profesional - La Salle Mollerussa", "Oxford International Education and Travel Ltd", 28195.0, 2, 3, "La Salle Mollerussa has been a renowned educational centre in our administrative district, El Pla d\u2019Urgell, for more than 100 years.

Erasmus+ scholarships are essential to make it possible for most vocational training students to take part in mobilities, since economic difficulties will no longer be an insurmountable barrier.\r\n \r\nWe are going to organise mobilities for students as a part of their work placements and we are working from our school to tailor them to their training needs to the maximum. Our idea is to start with small groups of about 10 students per year in this KA102 project and in the KA103 one, which we are also applying for. The students\u2019 improvement in the mastery of languages is beyond question after a mobility, and even more so after a traineeship, because they will have had to communicate in the target language all day long.\r\n\r\nAs regards teachers, observing other ways of teaching can only be positive and, if we also get them to improve their level of English, they will be able to teach a part of a formative unit in English. We would like 4 of 5 teachers to participate in a KA102 mobility every year.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, benefits may be manifold. In the first place, our students will improve their curriculums and gain a view of a more global world. This may turn them into entrepreneurial people with broader minds when it comes to pursue their goals.\r\n\r\nSecondly, teachers will be more trained, motivated and better prepared to respond to the education challenges which may come up, and they will be able to adapt their school objectives to the demand for skilled workers which companies require, as suggested in the New Skills Agenda for Europe.\r\n\r\nFinally, for both our school and our area, taking part in European projects will enable the next generation of businesspeople, workers and entrepreneurs to have a better training and to develop a sense of European belonging, which will help them to have a positive attitude to broaden their professional goals. This may have only positive effects for the economy of our area and for the social fabric living here. \r\n\r\nAll in all, Erasmus+ projects are a cornerstone for a competitive Europe in the 21st century, with better trained students and teachers, who have a positive attitude to tackle the challenges demanded by the present society\u2019s daily life.", "https://www.oxfordinternationalenglish.com/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-035317_1"]]}}, "4HL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1377993600000, 1504137600000, "Develop and demonstrate a \u2018Mini-factory\u2019 concept for production of personalized skin care products for elderly population", "Ascend Technologies Limited", "Skin alterations within ageing are significant and visible, and therefore disturbing feature in the quality of life of aged people.
