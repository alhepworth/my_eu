All the partners\u2019 schools believe that knowing our own culture and its particularities, firstly, will then help our pupils to discover and get interested in others cultures, from other countries. It is a way of questioning ourselves about differences and similarities between each others. More globally, the target is to help our pupils to build and develop a feeling of an European culture through the discovering of 5 others cities partners in this project:  London, Madrid, Paris, Rome, Tallin.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the beginning of our project is to make (re)discovered to our pupils their neighbourhood, their area. This is the first step of our project: our pupils will be encouraged to look at the facades of their neighbourhood buildings, the shops, the places of interest around where they live and describe it in a characteristical way. Then, our pupils will go farther, discovering their all city and even around it, to discover and experiment the famous monuments and the different kind of transport.\r\nIt is through the exchange of pupils\u2019 productions from each partner schools that our pupils will discover the others cities and their heritage. Finally, it is through the gastronomy that this discovering of other cultures will be completed.\r\n\r\nThe main target of this project is to motivate our pupils and make them actors of their learning through the study of \u201cconcrete\u201d subjects, close to their life. During all the activities of the project, our pupils will have to call up multidisciplinary competences likes linguistical, technological or artisticial competences, for example.\r\n\r\nThe pupils\u2019 productions will be valorised in different exhibitions in their schools, in public places from each city, in each school websites and twin space created in etwinning for this project.

The school's philosophy is to use methods which will increase the potential of learners, the vitality of the Italian language and the enjoyment of learning. For this, particular attention is devoted to the best existing emerging methodologies and advanced pedagogy.\r\n\r\nSince 2014 Vivere l'italiano has  also been a  teacher training centre which regularly organizes seminars, themed and bespoke workshops for their own tutors and external teachers.\r\n\r\nThe project \"Teaching Italian Through and with Glottodramma , Multimedia and Technology\",  complements and broadens, a work path which Vivere l'italiano embarked and recently culminated in the creation of Vivere l'italiano Teacher's Training Centre. It will start with the training of two key role members of the staff in Glottodramma and Creating Multimedia Activities  for Language Teaching Training. The participants are a language tutor specialised in teaching Italian as a L2 and LS with sound experience in the theatre field, and the Course Coordinator,  trainer  specialised in teaching MACs (mixed ability classes), assisted by technology.\r\n\r\nObjectives, in the short and long term, of the project, which fit in with school's overall European Development Plan, are:\r\n\r\n1) increasing knowledge and awareness of the teachers of how new tools and  modern methodologies can be used in class to optimize the learning experience of the180 Vivere l'italiano students\r\n2) cascading the activities and outcome through the training of our teachers\r\n3) creating a network of international contacts\r\n4) launching, within the existing Vivere l'italiano Teacher Training, a Glottodramma Training  and Technology Enhanced Language Learning Departments (TELL).\r\n\r\nThe results and impact envisaged can be summarised in:\r\n\r\na) highly qualified and trained staff\r\nb) empowered learning for the school's students\r\nc) innovation and modernisation of Vivere l'italiano' s teaching methods and curricula\r\nd) a wider audience, from different background, of learners, trainees and teachers\r\ne) a network of international contacts.

Our longer-term aim from this will be to develop international collaboration in high school economics with a view to creating an Olympiad competition.\r\n \r\nIt will involve a single member of staff who is a senior teacher with extensive experience economics and of UK economics education. \r\n It will allow them to explore what topics are taught in both micro-economics and macro-economics.  It will explore how the coverage differs from the UK A level and Pre-U courses, which we have extensive experience in.  It will also explore the approach to teaching economics in France and how pedagogy differs from the UK.  There will be a particular focus on \"stretch and challenge\", with a view to helping to identify which topics could be used as the basis for an international Economics Olympiad (based upon elements of the CORE e-book).  The long term benefits in our school will be an improvement in economics teaching, with a wider range of topics and pedagogical approaches.
