In fact, just about any nuclear/genome function has a spatial component that has been implicated in its control. We know surprisingly little about chromosome conformation and spatial organization or how they are established. The extent to which they are a cause or consequence of genome functions are current topics of considerable debate, however emerging data from my group and many other groups world-wide indicate that nuclear location and organization are drivers of genome functions, which in cooperation with other features including epigenetic marks, non-coding RNAs and trans-factor binding bring about genome control. Thus, genome spatial organization can be considered on a par with other epigenetic features that together contribute to overall genome control. The classical paradigm of early mammalian development arguably represents the most dramatic and yet least understood process of genome reprogramming, where a single cell undergoes a series of divisions to ultimately give rise to the hundreds of different cell types found in a mature organism. Study of pre-implantation embryo development is hindered by the very nature of the life form, composed of extremely low cell numbers at each stage, which severely limits the options for investigation. My lab has recently developed a novel technique called single cell Hi-C, which has the power to detect tens of thousands of simultaneous chromatin contacts from a single cell.

However, this creates a new challenge for medical science, to facilitate healthy ageing. With age, the function of the immune system declines, rendering older people more susceptible to infections and less able to benefit from vaccination. Indeed, improving vaccine efficacy is key to reducing infection-related morbidity in older people.  To date, the complexity of the ageing process has hindered attempts to fulfil this ambition, and thus innovative approaches are required to better understand the underlying biology.\n\nVaccination creates protective immunity by inducing the germinal centre (GC) response, an intricate process that generates memory B cells and long-lived antibody-secreting plasma cells.  However, the GC response declines with age.  Strikingly, it is not B cells that are responsible for the age-dependent decline in the GC response, but the CD4\\ T cells and the microenvironment of older individuals. The cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible, however, remain unknown. In the GC there are two subsets of specialised CD4\\ T cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells, which act in opposition to promote and suppress the response, respectively. I hypothesise that aberrant formation and/or function of Tfh and Tfr cells contribute to impaired GC responses during ageing, and that these cells could be targeted to improve vaccine efficacy.  Furthermore, the most prominent age-dependent change in secondary lymphoid tissues is the accumulation of senescent cells, which can modify immune function and tissue structure. I hypothesise that accumulation of senescent cells alters this microenvironment, impairing the response to vaccination. I will test these hypotheses using new mouse models and innovative approaches to human research, in the expectation that the knowledge obtained will promote healthy ageing and uncover novel aspects of GC biology.", 1263181.0, 1263181.0, 1, 1, "TWILIGHT", null, "http://www.babraham.ac.uk", null, "h2020_196771_999473742"], [1433116800000, 1590883200000, "Beyond genotype to phenotype: how ancestor lifestyle impacts on lifespan variation in descendants", "The Babraham Institute", "There are many examples in nature where inter-individual variability in life-history traits is exploited as an adaptive strategy. I and others have shown that inter-individual variability in the longevity pathways \u2013and in particular, in stress response genes- has consequences for genetic/environmental phenotypic robustness as well as for lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. My main interest is to uncover the causes that explain inter-individual variability in lifespan. The variability across individuals must include an important non-genetic component because the laboratory strains of this nematode are genetically homogeneous. I propose that lifespan variation is a by-product of non-genetic sources of variability in the pathways that control longevity. Strikingly, inter-individual differences in stress responses are transgenerationally transmitted. Transgenerational memory is an adaptive strategy that informs the next generation about the likely environmental cues that will be encountered, and sets patterns of gene expression by the incomplete erasure of chromatin marks in the germline. I hypothesise that transgenerational epigenome inheritance introduces transcriptional variability for genes that influence lifespan. Also, I propose that the probabilistic nature of lifespan is caused by inter-individual differences in the inheritance of longevity genes that set the rate of ageing from early development. Understanding the basis of lifespan variability is crucial for personalised medicine, where not the average population but rather the individual is centre stage. It is equally crucial for the identification of new factors that may have been missed by the analysis of population averages that can have an impact for human ageing and health.

Mouse primary macrophages expressing either i) a TRPV2-GFP construct containing an extracellular flag tag or ii) specific shRNA against TRPV2 will be obtained using the innovative technique of adoptive transfer of haematopoietic stem cells transduced with appropriate retrovirus.

This will slow the patients\u2019 cognitive and functional decline, avoid carers getting exhausted and reduce costs of emergency care.\n\nOur project will comprise two phases: first we will use digital accessibility tools to re-design the existing application for dementia patients. The development will be steered by patients, carers and doctors, through user-centric design: we will collect feedback on each new version of the application until the design is perfectly adapted to the users\u2019 needs. In the second phase we will pilot the optimised application with 1,100 users (patients \\ carers) and 1,100 controls. This will show the clinical and social benefits for patients and carers, as well as financial benefits for the healthcare system.\n\nSuccessful delivery of the pilot will increase patients\u2019 adherence to treatment (10 %-points), while improving the quality of life of carers and patients. It will save healthcare providers \u20ac1,818 / patient / year in care costs and will generate revenue of over \u20ac18 million / year for the consortium (Year 5).", null, 3201372.0, 7, 12, "SMART4MD", null, null, null, "h2020_194061_950480400"]]}}, "3HY": {"creative": {"data": [[1504224000000, 1535673600000, "Multi-Language / Multi-Modal Automated Film Tagging Service", "FILMDOO LTD", 52981.0, 2, 2, "European film products have largely failed to exploit the rapid globalization and internationalization of the film industry value chain.

The REPRISE project will thus be focused on overcoming these issues and improving technology performance, reliability and safety using new technologies and health-management algorithms.\nProject activities will start testing an available EMA (electromechanical actuator) and ECU (electronic control unit), which meets in general the requirements reported in the CfP, on an available test rig until mechanical failures occur. These tests will allow the development of a Health Monitoring System (HMS) able to detect degradations of the mechanical components before they will evolve into failures. New sensors will be added, to those already embedded into the available EMA, to verify their capability to detect part degradation. The EMA will be then redesigned in order to improve reliability and reduce weight and envelope through the introduction of new technologies into EMA/ECU, new sensors and the HMS. Finally, the improved EMA and ECU will be tested to demonstrate both performances and effectiveness of HMS.\nPointing at the success of the project, the REPRISE consortium strength lies in the association of different expertise, from different type of active members (SME, academia and industry). This association will benefit to all involved partners by sharing resources, skills and competencies on a high technological field with a major growth potential. From a wider point of view, this challenging project opens the small aircraft market sector to cutting edge technologies and will be beneficial to the whole aeronautical market as well.", 162202.0, 1139275.0, 2, 3, "REPRISE", null, null, null, "h2020_205606_952783374"]]}}, "7QY": {"cordis": {"data": [[1430438400000, 1446249600000, "Disrupting the real-time medical imaging market, and accelerating innovation, with cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS)", "Cydar Limited", "Medical imaging science has progressed greatly in recent years with advances in cloud computing power, computer vision, machine learning and augmented reality. There is global political will to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery through better exploitation of information technology. But there is surprisingly little translation of research output into clinical systems supporting real-time imaging. \nLarge hardware manufacturers currently dominate the software market for image-guided surgery. Their business model is based on high capital expenditure for installing large equipment that combines hardware and software. But this model means high costs and long lead times for changes, creating high barriers to innovation.\nCydar has identified an opportunity to disrupt this model by decoupling software innovation from the hardware. The concept is a dedicated cloud platform that hosts third-party applications, while handling image anonymisation, information security, governance and data storage. The core, tested technology involves a standard PC and web browser securely streaming the live imaging in the operating room to the cloud platform. \nThis business model is cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS), hosting applications for enterprises, healthcare organisations and academic institutions. Revenue streams include hosting fees and fees for access to the stored data for secondary use.\nCrucially, end-user markets become widely accessible, costs are lowered, lead times slashed and the commercial risks of innovation reduced.

Our primary aim is to provide an opportunity for people to find out more about researchers within a European context through live discussions (at a public event and through radio phone-ins). In England, listening to the radio is an important part of everyday life with an average listener hearing over 20 hours of radio a week. There are a diverse range of stations, both local and national, which together cater for almost every taste in music, news and entertainment. There are 38 local BBC radio stations which together with the national stations, account for over half of all radio listening in the UK.

ERIA was instigated to coordinate research into ALK-related malignancies to facilitate the development of less-toxic and more efficacious therapies. ALK is increasingly recognised as a prevalent oncogene in a number of human malignancies and therefore poses a prominent clinical problem, which requires coordinated research into its oncogenic mechanisms. ERIA now conducts a collaborative multidisciplinary research programme at the interface of biomedical and bio-mechanistic approaches, which will be an excellent environment to train the next generation of European scientists. The 15 recruited fellows will be incorporated into international academic study groups (all partners of the ERIA network) to perform high calibre research and also will be exposed to environments from other sectors to broaden their experience.
