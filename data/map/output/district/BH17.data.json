Direct earth fire combat using hoses is a key method used for fighting fires in forestry environments, often used in conjunction with air fighting and other methods. Given the unpredictability of fire in natural environments, versatility and safety are key element to de successful action of the fire brigade. Currently used fire hoses cannot resist more than 1 minute to a direct fire of 350C, resulting in many cases in hoses burning as a consequence of now fire start ups. This has shown dramatic consequences in fire-fighter\u00b4s safety, as well as a decrease in the versatility and efficiency of direct fire combat action plans. The project aims to produce a novel fire-fighting hose system for forestry applications able to provide enhanced versatility, efficiency and safety of fire-fighters in their forestry protection action plans.

The environmental, political, and economic pressure to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions associated with transportation means that reducing turbulent skin-friction drag is a pressing engineering problem.\n\nThe current project will tackle this problem with the development of superhydrophobic nanostructured top coatings, which do not only exhibit improved aerodynamic efficiency but at the same time they prevent icing on the aircraft. The nanostructured coatings will be based on metal oxides or nanostructured carbon (carbon nanotubes or graphene). Both types of nanoparticles can become superhydrophobic by suitable surface treatment while nanostructured carbon can also thermally activate the coating using the plane's on-board electrical system.\n\nThe proposed project involves the synthesis and chemical modification of ad-hoc nanoparticles.
