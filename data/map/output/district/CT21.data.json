The students come from the surrounding rural districts of the Emsland, Steinfurt and Osnabr\u00fcck and have deep roots in their home. With this project they are given the chance to gain first work experience at a foreign work place and to improve foreign language as well as intercultural skills in order to prepare them for the challenges of a changing regional, national and European job market. \r\nThis project is built on the experiences of the former HuebEurope I Project, which has been running successfully within the EU programme Leonardo Mobility for two years. \r\nThe project is supported by the EU office of the regional government of M\u00fcnster. \r\nThe project is applied for a total number of 44 participants. It will be carried out in two flows, each with 20-24 participants, who will be sent off for two weeks after the Easter holidays of the years 2016 and 2017. \r\nThe target group of this project are the vocational full-time students specialising in Business, Administration and Foreign Languages. \r\nThe project consists of two actions: \r\nThe main action is the offer of a two-week work experience in different British companies and institutions (e.g. primary schools, grammar school, residential home for the elderly) in the county of Kent. Participants are accommodated in British host families. The H\u00fcberts\u00b4sche Schule organises travel and accommodation of the participants. Two teachers of the college will accompany and support the participants on site during their stay. \r\nThe second, new action is to offer the possibility of a funded foreign work experience to those students who have succeeded in finding a work placement due to their own personal commitment. This action is mainly focussed on foreign branch offices and distributors of regional companies. In this case travel and accommodation will be organised by the participants themselves, who will be supported by the teaching staff of the college.

Among all RE sources, wind energy is currently viewed as one of the most significant fastest growing (at an average annual growth rate of more that 26% since 1990), commonly used and commercially attractive source to generate electrical energy.\n\nThe vision of the wind industry in Europe is to increase wind\u2019s fraction of electrical energy mix to more than 20% within the next 2 decades. To implement this, an average 10-15GW of additional capacity must be manufactured, delivered and implemented every year in Europe. In order to achieve this, further improvements in wind turbine technology are still needed. Wind turbines are not new concepts but still face challenges as a stable and reliable source of energy \u2013 issues with efficiency, operations, maintenance and its general costs.\n\nThere is a need to reduce the rate of electrical system faults and the corresponding downtime per fault which will contribute significantly to the overall reduction of the operational and maintenance cost associated with current and future wind turbines.
