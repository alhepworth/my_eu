We aimto self-empower participants for mutual solidarity, active participation in society and democracy through the development and practice of methods and strategies in order to manage challenges of involvment in social-change structures as part of different minorities.\r\n\r\nObjectives of this youth exchange\r\n- Coming together and meeting across differences: Young socially and economically disadvantaged people from different countries and backgrounds have come together to exchange experiences and learn from each other. \r\n- Mutual exchange: Participants exchanged experiences based on marginalisation and discrimination to learn tolerance and respect and grow self-esteem in order to become active in changing the world they live in.\r\n- Understanding and language: Participants have learnt and enhanced their language skills, as well as learnt words in the other participants languages, as well as have grown confidence to communication beyond language barriers.\r\n- European-wide friendships \u2013 European values: The young people have build trust and friendships among eachother and have developed a connection to European values such as tolerance, respect and democratic processes.\r\n- Self-esteem and independence: The young people have grown their confidence and see themselves as an active part of society, having developed self-initiative to follow through projects. This will help to find their way from marginalisation into a self-determined life and possibly into the job market. \r\n\r\nMethodology used in the project\r\nInteractive and participatory methods of non-formal education\r\nTheatre of the Oppressed\r\nImprovisation Theatre\r\nPerformance\r\n-> As body-mind connecting practices that build to grow self-esteem and empowerment and to find ways to overcome discrimination and marginalisation.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThere will be 42 youth participants from three different countries, Eastern, Western and Northern Europe, who are facing marginalisation and discrimination based on their gender, sexual orientation, origin (migration or refugee background and low income families), disability and religion.\r\n\r\nActivities\r\nA planning and preparation meeting will allow partner organisations as well as some of the young participants to meet and bring together the organisations of the youth exchange. \r\nThe main activity will be a 16 days long youth exchange with a mixture of organised workshops and participant led-sessions. Including session on theatre the of the oppressed, improvisation theatre, guided tours, presentation from the participants about their background and home countries, as well as practical skills in facilitation, listening and peer-support. \r\n\r\nResults of the project\r\n42 young people who face discrimination will have met and be empowered to stand up for their rights and liberation \u2013 knowing and respecting different people. Also, there will be experience and lessons learnt in organising across difference which will be used for future projects. \r\n\r\nEnvisioned impacts\r\nHigher self-esteem, feeling empowered and having gained confidence will mean more active participation in society for the participants. An informal network of peer-support of the young participants will be formed. Moreover, participants will have learned skills in facilitation and preparing and organising workshops. Also, the partner-organisations will strengthen their European network for future transnational projects. \r\n\r\nLong-term benefits\r\nWorking towards ending discrimination and marginalisation allows the European Union to become a place where human rights are truly in place.

In our ever faster moving society, more people, especially in the third sector, where a major share of the work is done voluntary, are heavily impacted by burn-out through increasing levels of stress and insecurity. So that important resources, knowledge and contacts are lost which are a key of dealing with multiple social and environmental crisis. That is why the development of sustainable strategies for civil society involvement has a great importance for society, especially for youth and young adults. \r\n\r\nObjectives of the transnational youth initative:\r\n- build knowledge and experience of burn-out and burn-out prevention in civil society groups and activities for young people\r\n- pass on experiences and knowledge to youth and young adults, who are active in environmental-, peace- and other civil society groups.\r\n- making young multiplicators more resilient, in order to better deal with the challenges of being involved in civil society activities in order to strengthen groups of civil society.\r\n\r\nProject activities:\r\n- develop an education methods tool box for sustainable civil society engagement (innovative, open educational resource). This will be passed on in two ten days long trainings, with 30 participants per training \u2013 one will take place in Germany, the other one in the Netherlands. \r\n- educational material will be collected and developed (on burn-out and sustainable involvement in civil society groups):.\r\n-> handouts\r\n-> a movie that shows best-practive examples. \r\n- Workshops in the areas of the partner groups (ca. 10 Workshops per group in two years, ca. 15 participants per workshops = 600 participants).\r\n\r\nThe results of the project will be passed on personally at the trainings and on the internet through the fact sheets, handouts and the movie.  \r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nThe project is carried out by young adults. They aim at working self-empowered and self-organised - listening and learning from eachother. \r\n\r\nAt the trainings and workshops participatory and experience-based innovative methods are chosen, so that all participants can contribute and take part equally, as well as supporting and enabling self-empowered learning and participation.\r\n\r\nResults and impact of the project:\r\n- material on burn-out prevention and sustainable involvement in groups of the civil society is created (curriculum/ tool box of methodes, handouts, film) -> open educational resources\r\n- enhance capacities and experience of educational youth work in terms of sustainable involvement in groups of the civil society in the participating groups (organisation management and professional development) and among the participants of the trainings.\r\n- knowledge and access to material about burn-out and sustainable social commitment in German, Dutch and English. \r\n-> through this support and enabling of young people to fully participate at democratic processes.\r\n\r\nLong term impact:\r\nYouth and young adults who are involved in groups of the civil society can be active long term without burning out and therefore dropping out.

The creation of the Hibernian Community Foundation as an independent charity in 2008 signalled a clear commitment to step up the efforts to have wider scope and greater impact. The aim of Hibernian Community Foundation is to provide opportunities to everyone through which they can improve their lives. We utilise the power of football and the Hibernian Community Foundation brand across Edinburgh and the Lothians to engage people in a way which other organisations can't. It's the work of our programmes and excellent staff which makes the real difference.\r\n\r\nPart of the Hibernian Community Trust includes the operation of the Hibernian Ladies football coaching and teams. Hibernian Girls and Ladies are amongst Scotland's most successful female football setups. Hibs Ladies are very much a community-based team with a strong commitment to grassroots girls\u2019 football, inspiring young ladies to be active and pursue their dreams in becoming successful football players, or leaders in sports coaching. Our mix of volunteer and part-time coaches support the ladies and girls\u2019 teams by providing coaching, match analysis, and aims to grow the woman\u2019s game and aid the development of young female players so they too play on a level on a par with the men\u2019s game.\r\n\r\nParticipation in women\u2019s football is low, and retention of players is even more problematic. Notably, it is around the age of 16-18 where we see the biggest drop out from the game. It is our aim to combat and increase the numbers participating in women\u2019s football and encourage and motivate young, talented female players to continue progressing with the game once they leave school. There is a vast degree of inequality in football, with the women\u2019s game regarded as somewhat of a lesser sport. This is grossly unfair and Hibernian Community Trust seek to tackle this head on.\r\n\r\nThis project will allow a group of 30 female coaches from The Hibernian Community Trust, aged 17-32 to participate in mobility in Spain, gaining experience in the coaching and community initiatives that drive women\u2019s football in Spain and gives it the platform for success that it so deserves. Participants will travel to the Valencia region for a duration of 10 days.\r\n\r\nMobility will focus on improving the employability for female coaches, players and football professional support staff through a structured mobility experience which will involve the acquisition of key Spanish coaching initiatives and competences. Our project objectives include:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Improve technical, tactical, physical and physiological aspects of the game.\r\n\u2022 Enhance the vocational educational programme of HCT.\r\n\u2022 Assist in the continuity and togetherness of the girls and ladies teams.\r\n\u2022 Learn about Spanish best practice and coaching innovations.\r\n\u2022 Improve the employability of coaches\r\n\u2022 Empower, motivate, engage, and inspire young women and girls in football; to increase participation and player retention.\r\n\u2022 Improve linguistic abilities and cultural awareness, both in football and society.\r\n\u2022 Improved professional development of participants via the implementation of a structured work programme during the course of an Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n\u2022 Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility professionals in Spain and the UK.\r\n\u2022 Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional careers within women\u2019s football.\r\n\r\nFemale participation in football and the subsequent retention of players is extremely low, and this project seeks to  establish grounds to combat the inequality in football. This project will develop elite female athletes and coaches to enhance their abilities. Our coaches will deliver these lessons in Spanish football to the female teams at HCT from grassroots level through to the first team, with the intention that developing and innovating our coaching programme will increase the participation rate of female players.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to address the gender imbalance in football and while we will tackle this as best we can, we are under no illusion that this project alone will solve the problem. What it will do however, is start the process in Scottish Football to raise awareness of the need for more investment in women\u2019s football, creating discussions and highlighting the benefits to women in being able to pursue sustainable employment as elite athletes or coaches in the game.

The participants should all have experienced a tough time in life, and found a way to deal with it. They should all have a wish to use their experiences to convey and inform both youth, professionals and others about youth and mental health.\r\n\r\nThe main activity is an international youth conference taking place in Vest-Agder, Norway, from 6. to 10. august 2014. We will invite 10 participants from Young Carers Scottland, 10 from Det Sociale N\u00e6tverk Denmark, and 20 from Norway. In addition there will attend 10 leaders from the three countries. The leaders from the three organisations has the main responsibility for their participants during the whole project. \r\n\r\nThis conference is designed for youth and young adults who use their experiences as next of kin and/or their personal experiences with different mental health challenges. Our goal is to inspire, care and share their experiences with other people, such as school classes, parent groups, mental health professionals etc. Our goal is also for us all to learn from eachother as well as trying to create new ideas and strategies for dealing with this kind of problems.\r\n\r\nThe international Care and Share Conference should inspire both individuals and the parter organisations so that they can increase their work with informing and sharing the important messages about mental health problems, and how to overcome them. In that way we hope to reach more people, both youth, professionals working with youth, politicians and parents.\r\n\r\nWe wish that this conference can contribute to the massive task to reduce the taboos regarding mental health. We also wish that young people who struggles easier can find a way to overcome their challenges, as they learn that others has made it.\r\n\r\nThe International Care and Share Conference will help young adults to be more active in their local communities, and to lift up the voices of a group of young people that often are forgotten in the democratic processes.", "http://www.youngcarers.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NO02-KA105-000049_2"]]}}, "6LR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Language Training", "Craigentinny Primary School", 21090.0, 1, 1, "In this current session 2015/2016, staff have been teaching French from nursery to primary 7 as  part of the Scottish Government 1 + 2 initiative for all primary children to be taught two  languages in addition to English and for their introduction to modern languages to begin at an early stage.  All staff have received initial training to enable them to become familiar with French resources and introduce some basic French in their classrooms. Staff skills are very varied with some staff having a certain level of French or Spanish and some staff having none.  The next step is for us to develop and increase staff language skills so they have a minimum level of competence in speaking French and also to further staff confidence. Our aim is to have a progressive programme in place from nursery to primary 7 so that all children leave primary school with the ability to speak French at Curriculum for Excellence second level.We plan to attend a one week French immersion course organised by LFEE. This would improve teacher confidence and expertise in the teaching of French to young learners. It would provide participants with materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of French at primary level, including using the Internet and other ICT resources in class. It will help to develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France and improve participants' competence and performance in French. We plan for 12 staff to attend the week's immersion course. This would include management, teaching staff and support staff from nursery to primary 7.After completing the immersion course, staff will continue to share ideas and good practice and will be involved in the training of staff who did not attend. We aim for the target language to be embedded within the school as teachers will include French in daily routines and teach several lessons per week. Assemblies, displays and further opportunities for pupils to perform in French will be provided. New resources will be put on a shared drive within school. Further pupil resources will be purchased.", "http://craigentinnyps.uk", "Craigentinny Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023344_coordinator"]]}}}}
