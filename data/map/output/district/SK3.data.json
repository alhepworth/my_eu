Biomedical quality-assessed samples and data as well as biomolecular resources and molecular analysis tools are essential for academic and industry-driven research to treat and prevent human diseases. Although currently established national biobanks and biomolecular resources are a unique European strength, valuable collections typically suffer from fragmentation of the European biobanking-related research community. This hampers the collation of biological samples and data from different biobanks required to achieve sufficient statistical power. Moreover, it results in duplication of effort and jeopardises sustainability due to the lack of long-term funding. BBMRI will comprise: \u2022 biobanks of different formats (collections of blood, DNA, tissue, etc., together with medical, environmental, life-style and follow-up data), \u2022 biomolecular resources (antibody and affinity binder collections, ORF clone collections, siRNA libraries, proteins, cellular resources etc.), \u2022 enabling technologies and high-throughput analysis platforms and molecular tools to decipher gene, protein and metabolite functions and their interactions, \u2022 harmonized standards for sample collection, storage, preanalytics and analysis \u2022 harmonized databases and biocomputing infrastructure, \u2022 ethical, legal and societal", 40126.0, 6092439.0, 16, 55, "BBMRI", null, "http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/162431.jpg", "fp7_88365_999416221"]]}}, "9HX": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Spreading the European dimension of Our Ladys Catholic Primary School across the whole school community", "Our Ladys Catholic Primary School", 12063.0, 1, 1, "Our Lady's Catholic Primary School is an average sized one form entry primary school in the north west of England.\r\n\r\nFollowing a high successfully first project, which has had a significant impact on the language skills and confidence of staff and children in the school, we have identified further targets to extend the European dimension of our school.\r\nThese are:\r\n1. To build upon the improved language skills and confidence of KS2 staff from our first project by improving the skills of all staff across the whole school.\r\n2. To build stronger links with a link school in France to share ideas, resources and exchanges amongst more staff and more classes throughout the whole school.\r\n3. To embed French as a key part of the whole school and develop the European dimension of the school.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen Key action 1 funding for this project to send six members of staff on structured immersion courses in France, particularly focusing on members of staff in KS1 and teaching assistants to ensure that all staff have the opportunity of high quality training.\r\n\r\nThe courses we have chosen also include opportunities to visit a French primary school, with which we have already started to make strong personal and professional links.
