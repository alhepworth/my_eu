Our project is to now transform this into an outstanding nursery. Our focus is particularly on creating stimulating, creative and inviting environment in a pack away setting, injecting creative activities into pre-reading and writing activities and developing key ideas in both Reception and Nursery to link the two and create a continuity in education and care. These objectives are in our school action plan and this course will show us exemplary early years practice. Active participation, reflection and sharing of good practice on the course will allow us to implement the good practice we see. This will then be shared with the school community, village community and cluster of schools to improve the early years provision in the area. All of this will help us to build a stronger early years that allows children to reach their full potential in all areas and become a part of the community.", "http://Www.syreshamprimaryschool.co.uk", "Syresham St. James C of E Primary school", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036462_coordinator"]]}}, "5QT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Leadership Improvement and Enhancing Early Years.", "Helmdon Primary School", 13868.0, 1, 1, "Helmdon primary School is a small village school with 128 children on role. Approximately 45% of pupils are from the village of Helmdon with the others are from neighbouring villages or the nearby town of Brackley. 20% of the children have joined the school since their reception year. We have 5 mixed age classes. All year groups are taught separately for core subjects.\r\n10% of pupils are SEND. 5% are eligible for pupil premium, 2% are post looked after and we have 1 services child.\r\nOur mission statement is 'Inspire, nurture, challenge' Our aim is to provide a safe happy caring community where children grow and develop and in which they are respected and valued. Our challenge is to develop self-esteem, independence and resilience.\r\n\r\nWe are part of the Healthy Child project and have promoted the activities we have completed in school to the rest of our cluster of schools. We achieved the school games gold award last year and have sports crew and play buddies who support fellow pupils in activities. Pupil voice is important to us and we have an active school council and regular P4 C sessions and whole school debates. We are an Expert Centre for the Global Learning Programme and facilitate regular training sessions for schools in our area. We have recently established a link with a school in Finland and the pupils have started to exchange letters.\r\n\r\nWe hope to improve our provision for children in the early years and would like to learn from the good practice taking place in Italy. We also wish to improve our leadership skills amongst key staff, including our head teacher and subject leaders. Although part of the global learning programme, we have an ambition to become far better connected within a European context to set an example of a unified and open Europe to our young learners.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen to enable key members of staff to attend two particular training courses. The first is to visit Finland and engage in a programme that considers many aspects of the Finnish education system and various methods of leadership. The second is to attend a course in the Reggio Emilia region of Italy to engage with schools that employ the internationally renowned Reggio model, while also visiting the international Reggio centre. \r\n\r\nWe believe that improving these two significant aspects of our current provision will yield the maximum benefit for our school and its pupils. The attending staff have been strategically selected to maximise the benefits, based both on their current roles and responsibilities within the school (and the regional cluster) and their ability and willingness to share and promote what they have learnt on their return. The visiting teachers include the head teacher, two subject leaders, our SENCo and one of our leading teaching assistants.\r\n\r\nTo support our school development plan and some of our broader ambitions, we have set the following learning objectives for the two courses:\r\n\r\nTo support our pupils in becoming valuable global citizens\r\nTo support objective 1 by ensuring our staff have first-hand experiences of global education systems and models\r\nTo develop innovative approaches to teaching and learning \r\nTo improve/enhance our leadership models, throughout the school (not just the headteacher)\r\nTo develop pupils who are resilient to changes and appreciative of other cultures and nationalities  \r\nTo support our teachers in consistently delivering good or outstanding lessons.\r\nTo develop a more creative curriculum, incorporating current events and encouraging children to be independent learners.\r\nTo motivate and enthuse our teachers  to ensure better outcomes for children.\r\nTo increase our international networking with staff from other schools  \r\nTo improve the level of development in our early years provision.\r\nTo give staff more confidence and opportunities to use peer discussion as a development tool\r\n\r\nAs a result of members of staff attending the two courses we are confident that we can achieve the following impact:\r\nIncreased confidence in the various leadership and/or creative curriculum methods and activities\r\nThe generation of new international colleagues / partners\r\nImprovements to educational leadership abilities\r\nAbility to devise more creative curricula\r\nAdvanced pedagogic understanding\r\nCertified CPD training\r\nBetter understanding of developing resources through a community of professionals (collaborative development)\r\nFirst-hand experience and understanding of other European models / methods\r\nIncreased motivation and reinvigoration of practice\r\nIncreased staff satisfaction\r\nImproved leadership resulting in a more efficient (better) working environment\r\n(for cluster members) access to a body of knowledge delivered by a group of recently-informed staff\r\nA group of returning experts to share information and knowledge and to support other staff\r\nImprovement school professional development  profile\r\nA sense of global / European inclusion\r\nInteraction with schools and pupils from other countries", "http://www.helmdonprimaryschool.com", "Helmdon Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036287_coordinator"]]}}, "7DA": {"nhs": {"data": [["RP1", "Brackley Cottage Hospital", "nhs_RP1M2"]]}}, "7RP": {"cordis": {"data": [[1475280000000, 1538265600000, "Digitally controlled Braille and tactile graphic jet printing", "Kw Special Projects Limited", "The number of visually impaired people is continuously increasing in Europe and at the same time these people do not have the possibility to have full access to available visual content. They are restricted by the availability of content in Braille or tactile format. BrailleJet offers a multifunctional device (printer, scanner & photocopier) at an affordable price to be used at home freely and simply. BrailleJet uses a novel powder depositing method (patented by one of the partners) that allows the accurate placement of powder on a normal sheet of paper that is fused onto the surface to produce a tactile print. The operational model of our technology (buy the device, use normal paper and change the cartridge) is very similar to the inkjet operational model and therefore the commercialisation of such product can be modelled similarly to inkjet printers. Assistive technologies at present are usually available only in specialised stores, whereas BrailleJet will also be available in large electrical stores at estimated price of 250\u20ac per device.\nWe have completed a phase 1 project and have reached valuable results in our feasibility study through the user tests of our validated prototype with blind and partially sighted people. We have also built important networks with leading European associations and blind stores who have validated the commercial need for our product and expressed their unanimous interest in the future exploitation of this technology. With the help of the associations we have managed to collect exact information on the market size and have segmented our potential customers. There are 26.3 million visually impaired people in Europe, and about 6 million of them have such serious disability that restricts them from integrating into society and the world of work. \nWe have set up a competitive consortium consisting of commercial and technological partners who have the full capability to develop BrailleJet into a product and take it to commercial success.", 313757.0, 1440441.0, 2, 3, "BrailleJet", null, null, null, "h2020_205874_933387933"]]}}}}
