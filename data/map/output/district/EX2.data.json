In order to succeed, an experimental project has been set up and aims to award schools an academic label called \u201cEuropean School\u201d. The schools involved in this project must develop activities which open the pupils european outlook; encourage them to take part in trips and study programs of all types but also allow each pupil to attend non-linguistic lessons taught partly in a foreign language. The main aim is to give pupils as many possibilities to use the English language in different subjects and projects as well as the language course itself, thus allowing them to acquire the necessary skills for their future life as an European citizen. The setting up of this experiment involves proposing a series of training programs to the involved staff. The consortium is made up of 16 schools for this particular mobility program, all of which are part of the European school project. Thus, in the 2 years of the project, 141 participants will be able to carry out a mobility in England by attending organised lessons, adapted to the specific needs of each participant and/or a shadowing period in a European partner school. It principally concerns teachers of non-language subjects who wish to improve their English language skills but there are also language teachers, management and administrative staff who have been picked for their specific training needs.  Each person has been selected on the basis of specific criteria which have been defined by the Academy: committment to innovation, willingness to train in order to develop their skills and the committment to partake in a training program which not only includes an European mobility but also includes preparatory activities and the use of their new skills as part of the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe training program is based on a diagnostical evaluation of the linguistic capacities of the participants and defines the training activities which will take place before, during and after their mobility. The skills to be learnt and the way they will be used in a pedagogical approach are specified. The Europass language passport constitutes the instrument of measure of the training program, underlined in a mobility contract binding each of the different persons (the Local Education Authority, the participating school, and the training college or partner school). Except for our English teachers, the language skills of our trainees will be attested either by the \u201cDCL\u201d (which is a national professional diploma giving a level of the European Framework of Reference for Languages) or by the \u201cCertification compl\u00e9mentaire\u201d which certifies a recognised level of language skills in order to teach a non-linguistic subject in English.  The follow-up will be conducted by the Academy\u2019s Project Team which is composed of the Head Teachers of the consortium schools, a Project Leader Teacher in each school and several Team Leaders responsible for the day-to-day follow-up of a group of schools, under the responsability of the Academy\u2019s Delegate for European and International Relations, who manages the whole project with a Team Leader.\r\n\r\nThe training courses followed by each participant must help towards developing each pupil\u2019s English skills to a level where they can communicate, by increasing their time spent in presence of the language. Their acquired skills will lead to their success and improve their personal development and their employability on the national, European and international job market.\r\n\r\nThe trainees will be able to improve their English skills and the quality of their teaching in terms of language, culture and educational methods. They will also be able to constitute a network of European contacts in order to develop multidisciplinary educational cooperation projects. By improving the capacities of each of the participants, their mobilities will enhance the international dimension of their school which will be rewarded by the issuance of the academic label \u201cEuropean School\u201d.\r\n\r\nThese innovative projects will contribute to the evolution of our educational system. The experiment carried out in the Acad\u00e9mie de Reims is destined to be taken on board by a larger number of schools in the Academy. It is also easily transposable to other territorial contexts. This innovative project is in line with the strategic goals of \u201cEurope 2020\u201d defined by the European Commission in terms of education, for lowering school drop-out rates and increasing the number of higher education graduates.", "http://www.ipcexeter.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA101-013922_7"], [2016, "La R\u00e9union des ambitions professionnelles gr\u00e2ce au levier des mobilit\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes", "International Projects Centre Ltd", 202057.0, 4, 7, "Very recently, we have successfully applied for our ERASMUS+ project 2015. This has strengthened  our motivation to apply this year for an ambitious project which will benefit our pupils.We do also participate in the Reunion Island project through the regional education office's consortium.Our school has regularly been involved in LEONARDO and COMENIUS projects and thus we have been able to develop some expertise in the field of European mobility. Within the last four years, 25 staff members (including our Deputy Head and our fund manager) and 59 pupils from different vocational paths have taken part in mobility projects involving three different host countries: England, Spain and Sweden.The aim of our project is to make our school, Isnelle Amelin, an International Vocational School by 2017.To meet this goal, our training offer will be completed by 2017 with the opening of post-A Level diplomas; we will first launch a Higher National Diploma in Esthetics, Cosmetics and Fragrances - with a Management option.By then, our training offer should be supplemented by the opening of post- A -level sections (BTS : French equivalent of British HND) in order to supply our students with a European Vocational Curriculum.To achieve this goal, we are proposing a project which is well-rounded and which entirely meets our requirements:The aim of our Erasmus+ project is to train our staff on a large scale (15% of them).Thus, we shall offer 12 staff members the possibility to improve their linguistic and teaching skills, as well as to become part of a European professional environment.The staff members concerned will be the following:  1 member of the administrative team, 2 of the school office and 9 teachers (among whom 5 vocational teachers, 2 colleagues teaching general education subjects and 2 language teachers).The goal of this project being: -to improve linguistic skills -for our human resources, to gain more experience in managing projects leading to virtual or real mobility schemes. At the same time, we shall implement around 70 mobility schemes for pupils (that is a 50% increase compared to the Leonardo project 2013-2015). These mobility schemes will revolve around three main points: - The vocational dimension (involving 4 weeks of work placement) which will be recognized with the Europass diploma.- The cultural dimension (which will consist of a complete immersion of the students within host families, a programme of organised tours around the Capital City  and around the host area). The pupils taking part  will be volunteers coming from every pathway that our establishment offers. This project will be a long-term (spanning 2 school years). Most of the pupils involved will be the ones benefiting from state grants and who, before this project , would have had no opportunity to face any other environment than the one in which they evolve, Reunion Island.- The linguistic aspect  : a subject-specific language training which will hinge upon CLIL courses A diploma will also be awarded at the completion of the mobility project.Through these mobility schemes at the European level, we shall endeavour to develop and improve our pedagogic habits. These improvements will then undoubtedly benefit the entire teaching community and will bring about a positive impact on our daily teaching performances. They will also enhance our ability to manage projects.The change will also be brought about by the pupils taking part in the programmes since they will stand as examples of a new positive dynamic for their fellow students in the school.We expect that the international experience gained through these programmes will entail new relationships between pupils, teachers and the school administration. This experience will also be used as a tool to make pupils more aware of their responsibilities and improve their autonomy ;  it will help to the redesign of assessment tools as well, and will better prepare  our students for the working world.The staff members and pupils who will have been attending these trainings will undoubtedly be opened to new habits, and will contribute to improving the following areas:- increasing the number of pupils passing their vocational diplomas,- bettering the integration of our graduates within their workplaces,- enlarging the possibilities for our future students to work abroad after passing their A-levels.- giving the students real world context for their training- producing among all the pupils a healthy competition revolving around European projects including real or virtual mobility schemes (such as eTwinning for instance)- involving our school into future European projects by signing partnership contracts with the schools hosting our mobility schemes,- enhancing both the motivation and skills of our teams,- contributing to the attractiveness of our pathways- boosting the popularity of our school on the academic level- improving the image of Reunion Island througout Europe", "http://www.ipcexeter.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-022865_3"], [2018, "Vers la labellisation \"\u00e9tablissement europ\u00e9en\"", "International Projects Centre Ltd", 163527.0, 3, 3, "Four French secondary education schools located in the Marne region are involved in the \u00ab\u00a0Towards a European school label\u00a0\u00bb project. The pupils attending the schools come from various social and cultural backgrounds but the schools all have in common the aim to promote pedagogical innovation and international links to broaden pupils\u2019 opportunities. The Reims educational school authority\u2019s \u00ab\u00a0European school label\u00a0\u00bb plan is designed to offer pupils more opportunities to use English in various learning situations and projects which complement language lessons. It aims to make pupils acquire the necessary skills for their future as European citizens. The project aims to provide teachers and educators with language training courses abroad to improve and enrich their teaching skills. Proficiency in English as a common language will allow the setting of multidisciplinary projects between European partners, as a way to improve pupils\u2019 motivation, tend to a more positive school climate, and reduce early school leaving.\r\n51 members of staff are involved in the project. They are members of the administrative staff, educators or teachers of the schools. Each of them has taken part in implementing European and international links between their pupils and European pupils through school partnerships, letter exchanges or eTwinning projects. Participating in the project will help them improve and perpetuate the existing innovating actions.\r\nIn each school a steering committee manages the educational and financial parts of the project. Each member of the committees, and key persons in particular, bring their experience in project management. School managers as well as headteachers are part of the steering committees. The setting up of the project uses European and national tools as well as cooperation between steering committees members.\r\nThe project will allow the members of the staff to take part in language lessons. The participants will be able to attend English lessons adapted to their levels. Then, it should help them to communicate and exchange with their European partners for their future partnerships.\r\nA second part of the project is to take part in job shadowing, also aimed at teachers and members of the staff. This will allow them to observe teaching methods, to develop their professional skills, to exchange with their European peers and to discover new innovating methods to reproduce in their teaching process but also in the school climate. These activities will be a means of strengthening the existing partnerships and will help to make the multidisciplinary teamwork durable.\r\nThe participants are chosen regarding their motivation and their desire to take part in training actions and to reuse the benefits of their learning process in their teaching and educational practice. They will sign a contract for their mobility which will render their engagement to both take part in the training actions and to use the benefits official. The Europass language passport will be the tool used to follow their process. A diagnostic assessment of their language skills and a language certificate exam (DCL: which is a national professional diploma giving a level of the European Framework of Reference for Languages) at the end of the process will help to assess the progress of the participants that took part in the language lessons. Each school will highlight their participation in the project on their website or on their digital work space, during their Open Day or through communication with the newspapers.\r\nThe participation in this project and in the \u201cEuropean school\u201d label project of the concerned schools will allow the staff to develop their language, educational and cultural skills in order to have the pupils benefit from innovative practices. They will be able to create various European contact networks in order to develop their multidisciplinary teamwork projects. In the medium and long term, the goals are to have a more established European opening in the schools, to improve pupils\u2019 success and to guarantee a better employability for them in the future.

The project will end in June 2017 drawing into its wake two schools which did not belong to the first consortium but were, nevertheless, already proactive in their international links. \r\nIn order to respond to an ambitious goal presented in the second line of research of the academic project, which is to develop our students\u2019 competency in oral communication skills in a foreign language, the six schools are committed not only to promoting all actions that lead to opening up Europe and the virtual and physical mobility of their students but also to allowing each student to take full advantage of studying other non-linguistic subjects partly in the target language. The aim is not only to improve students\u2019 linguistic competency but equally to allow the acquisition of the competencies and skills necessary for their everyday life as young European citizens.\r\nTo this end, the actions of the consortium meet fully the national and academic priorities.\r\nEffectively, putting the \u201cEuropean Schools Project\u201d into place implies offering training facilities for the staff participating in the project. During the two years of the project, 83 members of staff will be able to travel to England, Spain and Germany within the framework of a structured and customised timetable and eight teachers will follow an observation course in a European partner school. This will concern mainly teachers of non-linguistic subjects who wish to develop their competency in a foreign language. Teachers of modern languages, heads of schools and administrative staff have also been chosen according to their training needs.\r\nParticipants have been selected on the basis of jointly defined criteria. The first one is the commitment to developing actions encouraging an open attitude towards the international scene and lessons in DNL (non-linguistic subject) given in a foreign language within their school. The second one is the commitment to enrolling in a training programme, not limited to mobility, but also including preparatory activities which are then put into practice with their newly acquired skills within the framework of an accredited European School. \r\nThe training programme is based on a diagnostic assessment of the linguistic skills of the trainees and defines the training activities which will take place pre, during and post course and states the expected linguistic acquisition and the ways in which it will relate to the teaching methods used in the classroom. The European Language Passport is the tool which states their track record as defined within the framework of a mobility contract between all committed parties that is: the school sending the trainee, the host school and the trainees themselves.\r\nAll members of staff (except language teachers) will be evaluated at the end of the training programme by the DCL (a professional diploma assessing the linguistic level obtained according to the CECRL) and teachers who wish will be able to enrol and take a complementary certificate in \u201cTeaching a Non-Linguistic Subject in English\u201d. The follow up will be undertaken by the steering committee of the consortium.\r\nIn responding to the training needs of teachers, this project will allow them to improve their language skills and the quality of the linguistic, cultural and pedagogic services they offer. Hence, on return from their course, staff will be able to make a dynamic contribution to cultural actions aimed at opening up their school internationally. In this way, the links created with foreign partners will facilitate new networks of European contacts and will help develop new partnerships.\r\nThe expected benefits to students, by increasing the time they are exposed to the target language, will be to reach a level in modern languages sufficient for communication purposes. The competencies thus acquired will enhance the success of young people from Haute Marne and improve their personal development and their employment potential on the European and international market.\r\nIn improving the abilities of each player in this project, the \u201cmobility programme\u201d will add to the international dimension of the school, which will be recognised by the ongoing academic accreditation of a \u201cEuropean School\u201d and educational recognition for the standard of teaching in the area of Chaumont-Langres.\r\nFinally, the common policy of the schools in this consortium will contribute to lowering students\u2019 failure rate and will increase the percentage of university graduates coming from this area.

Our CPIA 2 of Serramanna is located in the vast area of Southern Sardinia, in a mainly farming territory including the entire Medio-Campidano and the Sulcis-Iglesiente. This area is characterized by a very high youth unemployment rate; in particular, in the municipalities of Medio Campidano there is a higher percentage of NEET compared to the rest of the island. Our institute was founded in 2015 by the unification of five permanent territorial centers and had a new set-up  which favored the entry of tenured teachers with little experience in the field of adult education and especially in intercultural education.  The CPIA welcomes 1601 students of different age groups (from 16 to 80 years), different geographical origin (French-speaking, English-speaking, economic migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors) and different social and cultural level; the majority did not complete compulsory secondary education.\r\nThrough Erasmus Plus, the school aims to improve, update and implement the skills of our teachers and administrative staff, so as to offer activities and programs that better meet  the needs of our potential catchment area and that are able to  intercept those people not yet included in an educational path (NEETs, more fragile and disadvantaged people).\r\nThe specific objectives outlined are:\r\n- Develop welcoming practices to improve the inclusion and integration of community and non-EU students;\r\n- Improve the competence of teachers and staff in English and French;\r\n- Implement innovative methodologies, such as CLIL, particularly suitable for a multicultural context;\r\n- Strengthen the European and international dimension of the institution;\r\n- Improve the use of ICT to broaden methodological resources and access to training, including the use of distance learning platforms;\r\n- Implement the skills of English language teachers involved in preparing students for certifications at European level.\r\n\r\nThe initiative involves many of the permanent staff members, some of whom are key figures of the institute's management.\r\nThe number of mobility required is 25 and involves a collaborator of the headmaster with decades of experience in adult education, two members  of the school commission for the training and updating of the staff, for the PTOF area and for relations with the territory; teachers of L2; teachers of secondary education; an administrative assistant.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the objectives outlined, the project proposes the following activities:\r\n- A Job Shadowing in Belgium that will allow observing and importing best practices regarding the management of adult education, welcoming migrants, teaching methodologies in multicultural classes;\r\n- Structured courses  in Great Britain and France on English language skills, on French language skills, on CLIL methodology,  on the use of ICT and the Moodle platform for distance learning, on migrants' integration and inclusion practices.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to have the following impact:\r\n - better language skills for the staff ;\r\n- an implementation of teaching and digital skills of teachers and the ability to respond to the individual needs of learners with their social, cultural and linguistic diversity.\r\n- a growth of knowledge and skills in an international dimension that will increase the teachers' self - esteem with positive effects on the school.\r\n - an improvement in the integration and inclusion of all students, especially those from outside the EU;\r\n-  the opportunity for students to build a knowledge and an intercultural vision together with the teachers, as well as a multi-linguistic mentality through the CLIL methodology which will contribute to increasing the motivation and opportunities for learning a foreign language;\r\n- the opportunity for students to certify the competences acquired in class through the achievement of certifications recognized at national and international level .\r\n- greater openness to schools from other countries and to a European dimension.\r\nThe long-term goal is to create a community of teachers at national and European level that can exchange  best practices and train each other by sharing their skills.

All of them qualify for the general and specific criteria set by the school.\r\n\r\nThe activities are focused on improving language skills needed for communication in an intercultural environment, improving the qualification of primary school teachers in terms of understanding the modern and innovative practices for training, exchange of experience, professional ideas and opinions with teachers from other EU countries for the implementation of modern and creative teaching approaches.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the project provides an opportunity to familiarize teachers with other educational systems, such as the English, Italian, Polish and Finnish in order to compare the efficiency and make the best use of the individual system\u2019s strengths, and ensure that the curriculum in use is up-to-date.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the project the participation in international meetings and trainings is foreseen. The educational materials developed during the events will afterwards be shared. The materials include:   implementation guidelines for the eTwinning project; the created and distributed presentations and videos, curriculum breakdowns for individual classes, educational workshops for trainers and etc.\r\n\r\nImproving personal skills and competences of teachers involving in the project will have a positive impact on pupils, parents and teaching staff of all partner schools, particularly on Geo Milev Secondary School.\r\n\r\nAcquired creative and modern teaching methods will help with stimulating the students' interest to learn, overcome the problem of unexcused absences and early school leaving, as chosen methods are oriented toward a highly motivating personality of students through technology, art and creativity.\r\n\r\nThe experimental use of the method of the language integrated learning (CLIL) at Primary classroom will initiate during the project, and immediately after its completion it will be introduced through the curriculum as elective courses. That\u2019s why we see the experience acquired by the teachers during the trainings and monitoring phase as crucial.\r\n\r\nNewly acquired knowledge and skills will be integrated and applied in practical work not only in classes but also in extracurricular educational activities. Other international cultural projects will be applied in the work.\r\n\r\nThe school will consolidate its name as an educational institution with high standards and goals that operates and invests in their achievement.\r\n\r\nNumerous indoor and outdoor school activities /on regional, national and international level/ will be implemented for distribution and dissemination of the results during the whole project. Via diverse electronic platforms such as the school website, the electronic network of teachers-innovators, eTwinning platform and other professional and public media we will be periodically providing information about the objectives and methods of the project, methodical products developed during the training and exchange of good practices. The project will be presented to the parents\u2019 community in order to improve the image of the Bulgarian teacher and the school as an educational institution.\r\n\r\nThis way the benefits of the project will reach a vast number of recipients and ensure the widespread use as pedagogical and intercultural practice established along the course of the project. \r\n\r\nThe bridges to the future, which we are building, are an opportunity for our students to succeed in a united Europe.", "http://www.ipcexeter.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-BG01-KA101-000591_3"], [2018, "C.I.A.O. - Clil and Innovative Approach in our Organization", "International Projects Centre Ltd", 41938.0, 6, 7, "The Institute \"Majorana\" is a big high school in the district of Caserta, counting about 1300 students.

The school is located in an area rather deficient of  structures and services and it represents a strategic reference point  for initiatives aimed at bringing together young people, sharing social life and promoting culture. The school is strongly linked to its territory, deeply integrated in it; conversely, the school community has a lacking awareness of international cooperation and european dimension, although nowadays these aspects are considered essential to valorize an education oriented towards a \"global society\".\r\nOur institute has started a process of renovation of its educational programmes in the direction of a more extended European opening, in order to:\r\n- provide a more intercultural, integrated and motivating approach to the learning process;\r\n- enrich competences in response to modern society perspectives and challenges;\r\n- multiply opportunities to forward the transition from school education to work market.\r\n\r\nOur European Development Plan has identified some strategic areas to be improved through initiatives of broader international issue; this is the background of the project \"C.I.A.O. - Clil and Innovative Approach in our Organization\", which intends to answer to the following problems detected in our institute:\r\n1) Language competences of teachers inadequate to sustain a regular didactic activity based upon CLIL, which is also required by Italian Ministry regulations.\r\n2) Lack of specific competences about the CLIL methodology, also for teachers having adequate language skills.\r\n3) Poor diffusion of active didactic methodologies, alternative to traditional lessons.\r\n4) Weak european openness among the inspiring principles of the organization.\r\n\r\nIn response to these problems, the project \"C.I.A.O.\" objectives are:\r\n1) To reinforce the level of competences in English in our organization.\r\n2) To improve the competences in CLIL, in order to ensure a more capillary and aware usage of this methodology, also in compliance with Ministry regulations.\r\n3) To improve the competences in the usage of active/innovative didactic methodologies, in order to stimulate the most demotivated and little participant students and to reinforce their learning process at school, given the fact that students are less and less willing to study independently at home.\r\n4) To promote cooperation and good practise exchange at an international level, in order to open windows of our school on Europe.\r\n\r\nTo attain these objectives a transnational Mobility Plan will be realized in 7 different European countries, in which 20 teachers and the Headmaster will take part to training activities consisting in STRUCTURED COURSES and JOB SHADOWING experiences. The mobilities will involve: English mother tongue countries (England, Ireland); countries with high level of competence in English (Finland, Sweden); other countries in order to get in touch with as many different cultures as possible (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Spain).\r\nThe structured courses in England, Ireland, Czech Republic and Finland will focus on:\r\n- improvement of English level;\r\n- acquisition of CLIL methodology;\r\n- acquisition of innovative/active didactic methodologies;\r\n- exchange of good practices with European schools and knowledge of other education systems.\r\nThe job-shadowing experiences in Slovakia, Spain and Sweden will focus on:\r\n- observation of lessons of non linguistic subjects held with CLIL in English;\r\n- observation of lessons of English as foreign language;\r\n- observation of lessons based on innovative didactic methodologies, resources and technologies.\r\n\r\nThe teaching staff in our institute, made of 160 teachers, is very stable and consolidated: only 7 teachers (less than 5%) are temporary and more than 50% of teachers have been continously teaching for more than 10 years in the institute.

The new, progress-oriented mentality of the young generation, the perpetual development of technology, the major impact of the internet and social networks on our lives require a significant change in the role of the teacher who needs to adapt to rapid changes in contemporary society, a society based on knowledge and information.We believe it is essential for our teachers to benefit from personal and professional development courses that will facilitate the acquisition of new teaching methods and strategies and formal and informal education methods currently used in the European education system.This consistent personal and professional development of our teachers will result in an undeniable enhancement of teaching strategies using student-centered teaching methods, establishing partnerships and cultural exchanges with European schools.The target group of our project, \u201cThrough Creativity and Innovation to Performance\u201d, includes 14 teachers with different specialties, members of various local and county committees and chairs, some of them holding managerial positions within these committees.

Taking into consideration all these conditions, a number of 8 teachers, out of which 6 are of different specialties and 2 of English, are now involved in the Programme.\r\n     The applicants not only will broaden their horizons but will also contribute to a further spread of knowledge and acquisitions creating more attractive and interesting activities during their lessons. The mutual exchange between different people with different cultures will definitely prove to be a remarkable and beneficial merge that the authentic Europeans must feel and adopt. The results of all these courses that respond to the common and individual needs of the participants, will be reflected in future projects which the teachers will initiate in the future with other partners and in all their activities at school. Taking into account the perpetual cooperation and communication between schools and colleges in the world, the English language will bridge all social and cultural differences joining diversity and uniqueness.\r\n     We will be extremely thrilled and honoured to participate in these courses and take all the advantages this mobility holds and at the end of the period spent abroad, the teachers in our school will be involved in other major stages in their development, which are dissemination, application and evaluation of all the work done.\r\n     In conclusion, our project \"The Use of English Language - a Performance Factor in Education\" will contribute to the development of intercultural exchanges through not only formal but also informal and non-formal experiences and thus \"will lead the world to a better place\", a space for an open dialogue between cultures.", "http://www.ipcexeter.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-RO01-KA101-001124_2"], [2014, "Towards Europe: This way or that way?", "International Projects Centre Ltd", 19159.0, 3, 3, "1 .

The Erasmus programme with its instruments, provides many possibilities to do so. Because of their sharing the same area of development \u2013 \u201csocial and inclusive learning\u201d \u2013 the two schools form a consortium. The \u201cHerigoyen-Schule\u201d \u2013 being a bilingual primary school and focusing on improvement of media abilities \u2013 is in a unique situation, it will also work on the following areas of development \u201cteaching foreign languages and learning them\u201d and \u201cnew technologies, digital competences\u201d.\r\n\r\nProject objectives:\r\nThe improvement of linguistic and professional expertise of the teachers teaching the bilingual English classes is a crucial aim at \u201cHerigoyen-Schule\u201d. The contact with other European teachers and their exchange of professional views plus getting to know other cultural environments will widen the teachers\u00b4 horizons and improve the quality of their lessons. With this Erasmus project teachers will be enabled to teach their pupils how to attain knowledge in a modern way and how to learn to be critical while using modern technologies and media.\r\nMaking use of the knowledge of other European countries the following objectives shall be achieved in the shared area of development:\r\n\u2022 strengthening of the school administration\u00b4s process management,\r\n\u2022 optimization of existing curricula regarding individual support and social learning,\r\n\u2022 multiplication of the acquired knowledge on the level of supervisory school authority as well as the transfer of knowledge and new skills to local schools.\r\n\r\nProfile of participants:\r\nThe participants possess above-average qualifications and a comprehensive knowledge of their fields. They will disseminate the competences resulting from the project in their respective development areas and share them by means of school internal teacher training.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities:\r\nThe choice of courses was made due to the individual needs and knowledge of the participants and differs in length and level. The language courses are offered by certified language schools situated in English-speaking countries employing highly qualified staff. The job-shadowing will be a useful addition.\r\n\r\nThe course in new media follows contemporary teaching and learning trends. It takes into account the fast development in the area of multimedia and provides a future-oriented European platform for a profitable exchange of views.\r\nThe well structured and moderated  exchange of views during the stay in Sweden and South Tyrol includes a visit to several educational institutions and allows the participants to observe and learn how inclusive and social learning is carried out in other European schools and educational institutions.\r\n\r\nApproaches for the implementation of the project:\r\nThe participants\u00b4 tasks will be defined in the groups responsible for the areas of development. Newly acquired experiences and knowledge  will be gathered in these groups, documented and finally passed to the control group in charge. The supervisory school authority will coordinate the entire project in close cooperation with the control group.\r\n\r\nIntended results and long-term benefits:\r\nTo learn about other educational systems and cultural environments will widen the teacher\u00b4s points of view especially regarding the described areas of development. Acquired knowledge will be used in their daily lessons und will effectively improve the quality of their teaching. Organisational structures will be reassessed and optimized.

Most of the large companies in the area have disappeared, leading many small businesses to close down as well, causing a tsunami effect. As a result of that, we can find  many unemployed low-skilled people with little chance of finding a job. Many of them are looking forward  to improving their situation and some are enrolled in the Administrative Management Training Course, which is the subject of this Erasmus + Project. The lack of alternatives, the promotion of employment, the promotion of social equity and inclusion are the main factors that have triggered the presentation of this proposal.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nFor the IES Francesc Gil, if this proposal is accepted, it would mean the mobility of 6 students of the 2nd Basic Education course and the Medium-level Training Course in Administrative Management. Regarding the type of mobility of personnel, this would involve the mobility of 3 teachers from the Administration and Management Department of our school.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the host partners:\r\n\r\n- The Lyc\u00e9e Professionnel Notre Dame, in Castres (France). It is an institution with extensive experience in European projects, Comenius, Leonardo Da Vinci and Erasmus +. Through this educational center, IES Francesc Gil has established relationships with companies in the administrative sector in which students perform part of their training. The Lyc\u00e9e is a partner we definitely rely on since we have jointly carried out previous European projects (Leonardo Da Vinci and Erasmus +).\r\n\r\n- The Lyc\u00e9e Professionnel Golf H\u00f4tel in Hy\u00e8res (France). This partner provides the contacts and the corresponding logistics to approach the realization of the FCT (training at workplace) by the students. And also contacts with the Reception Partners (companies) where the practices will be carried out.\r\n\r\n- IPC Exeter, in the UK. This center will provide training in CLIL methodology for teaching staff.\r\n- Sprachschule Zum Ehrstein, in Germany, with regard to training in Dual FP (dual vocational courses).\r\n- And as a novelty, St. Caterine High School will provide training in entrepreneurship through Job-Shadowing and the creation of materials. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES:\r\n\r\nWithin the period of validity of the project there will be two truns of students mobility, consisting each of 4 weeks of internship and cultural preparation at destination. The first of them  is planned for the 2017/2018 academic year and the second one for the 2018/2019 academic year.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is planned to train a teacher of the Department of Administration and Management of the center in the CLIL methodology for the subsequent teaching of non-linguistic subjects in English. Another mobility of teachers for training in Dual Vocational Training. And also another mobility of teachers through observation or Job-Shadowing with the objective of introducing the knowledge in different subjects and the didactic materials elaborated in English.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\n\r\nIf the students are evaluated with \"pass\", this will result in the partial validation of the FCT (training at workplace) module with the corresponding hours.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it will also be certified with Europass, Youthpass, diploma of language preparation as well as diploma and certificate of the IES Francesc Gil that testify the realization of the students' residency.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the training of the teaching staff, it is expected that during the next two courses (2017/2018 and 2019/2020), non-linguistic modules may be taught in English in the Basic Vocational Training Course and in the Administrative Management Training Course in our school. It is also expected that this will apply to the Plurilingual Program of other courses in our school, IES  Francesc Gil.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Dual Vocational Training, it is planned to apply the good practices observed in other countries to the project that is now starting at IES Francesc Gil.\r\n\r\nLONG TERM BENEFITS:\r\n\r\n- As a differentiating element of the IES Francesc Gil compared to other schools in the area that offer courses of the same professional field, as regards the quality of its offer of FP (vocational training).\r\n\r\n- Promotion of the participation of various social agents of our region involved in issues of Youth and Employment.\r\n\r\n- Dynamic element to enhance the participation in other European projects in the future.\r\n\r\n- Integrating element with the rest of the Educational Community. This project brings together the wishes of the students' parents, the pupils themselves and the public authorities.\r\n\r\n- As a stimulus to the relationships between our School's Management Team and the teachers involved in the project.

We also host students following higher-education courses in Customer Relations, mature students who are changing career paths, students with disabilities and we also have a special structure to take care of students who are dropping out of school. \r\nAncenis is virtually equidistant from two very dynamic major urban centres, Nantes and Angers, and is at the heart of a vast, mostly rural, geographical area. The families and students who belong to this area are generally very attached to their territory, which might sometimes constitute an impediment to thinking of mobility as a tool of success, particularly if it must be on such a large scale as that of Europe. Besides, the socio-professional profile of our area is predominantly composed of manual workers and economically non-active people, a situation which is often related to a difficulty for student in developing a successful and ambitious educational progress, taking into account high-achievement training possibilities and current and future opportunities of mobility. \r\nOne of our major missions is to broaden the horizons for the actors of the educational chain in our school. In this perspective, we do our best to provide our staff with the best possible opportunities of international development and outlook, while always bearing in mind a central concern of both our school, our academy, our country and Europe: preventing young people from dropping out of the school system. This great theme develops many a question that we want to address: how should we tackle the growing heterogeneity of our students? How do we implement differentiated instruction? How do we consider the continuity between high-school education and higher education? How do we help our students to develop their ambition and create their own success in higher education and their professional life? \r\nWe hope to enrol different profiles of staff in this mobility project. Some may need linguistic reinforcement and CLIL-oriented training in order to improve their CLIL teaching or so they may take the CLIL certification. Some staff may need specific training on the questions related to the prevention of students dropping out of education. Taking courses in foreign countries and in foreign languages will both open their eyes to other cultural approaches of the question and improve their linguistic and intercultural skills. Some staff may want to get involved in the already-existing relationship with European partners along collaboratively organised programmes and thus increase our European mutualisation and cooperation. As a consequence, our multiple objectives towards improving our students\u2019 opportunities will have the best chances of being met. \r\nWith these mobilities, we hope to improve the quality of the existing CLIL offer, to develop the CLIL offer towards new profiles of students who do not yet see how they could get involved in a European education process. We hope to improve the pedagogical and educational skills of the staff in relation with the objectives announced in our Plan for European Development. We aim at associating our European partners in our progress and at developing our European network. Ultimately, we want to increase the importance of Europe in ours school and in the minds of the educational staff, of the students and of the people from the local community. \r\nThe impact of this project will be measurable at different levels. In class, the students who are already involved in European Sections will benefit from the improvement of the teaching they will receive. Hopefully, in the longer run, more students will be involved in European Sections. The students who are not involved in European Education will still benefit from the results of the project, particularly if their integration in the school system raises questions, through an improvement of how their teachers and educators tackle the problem. Indeed the scope of the mobilities will reach far beyond the staff members who will have benefitted from them directly. The latter will share their new knowledge and skill with their peers, through devices set up by the school, like intern training sessions or conferences.

It was also the partner that provided the contact to start training in the CLIL methodology in the Erasmus + 2014 call.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we have the LP Notre Dame de Castres (France). This is a private-subsidised establishment with extensive experience in Training and Management of FCT, which provides, inter alia, contacts with other Host Partners (companies) where students will later perform the module of Training in the Workplace. All with the security offered by experience in teamwork, which has been carried out within previous European projects (Leonardo and Erasmus +).\r\n\r\nWe should also mention IPC Exeter, with regard to training in CLIL methodology for teachers, and Sprachschule zum Ehrstein concerning training in Dual FP.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities:\r\n\r\nWithin the period of the project, 2 movements of groups of students are planned, which consist of four weeks of work experience and cultural preparation upon arrival. One of the groups is scheduled for next year 2015/2016, and the other for the 2016/2017 course.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it has been planned, in the form of Job Shadowing, that one of our teachers in the  Department of Administration and Management of our school will be trained in the  CLIL methodology for subsequent teaching in English of non-language subjects. There is also teacher mobility for training in Dual Vocational Training.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nIf a student is assessed as \u201cfit\u201d and therefore gets a pass, this will cause the partial recognition of the module \u201cTraining at Workplace\u201d, with corresponding hours worked.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a Europass, a certification of a diploma of linguistic preparation, as well as a certificate from our school \u201cIES Francesc Gil\u201d attesting stays will be provided.\r\n\r\nAs regards teacher training, it is expected that over the next two years (2015/2016 and 2016/2017) a non-linguistic module (Office) can be provided in English within the Cycle of Basic Vocational Training of the centre. It is also anticipated that this dynamic will extend the Multilingual program to other courses at the IES Francesc Gil.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Dual Vocational Training, we envisage applying the good practices observed in other countries to the project now commencing at the IES Francesc Gil.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefits:\r\n\r\n-The differentiation of \u201cIES Francesc Gil\u201d , as opposed to other schools in the area offering teachings of the same professional branch, as to the quality of its vocational training.    \r\n\r\n-Dynamic element to address, in future, participation in other European projects.\r\n\r\n-Encouraging participation of different social actors of our region involved in issues of Youth and Employment (from the Town Council,  which already is a host partner of French students in the Leonardo project, to trade unions and NGO's operating in the territory). \r\n\r\n-Integrating element with the rest of the educational community.

It is built upon the competence improvement of teachers, the efficient cooperation, the sharing of knowledge among the teachers of the same subjects and among the teachers working in the same groups and this tender is to help these features.\r\nThe head teacher and the teachers speaking a foreign language take part in the mobility of this teacher training project, which improves language teaching and ICT usage. They are committed to continuous improvement and development of the quality of education. Our training partners in the United Kingdom (IPC, ISP, Anglolang) have decades of experience in teacher training, their teachers are well-known experts. The job-shadowing programmes take place in the German partner school of our present Comenius project where our colleagues will be part of the life of the school in Halle, will visit and also give lessons.\r\nFor the smooth realization of the project an Erasmus+ group is formed in the school. We would like to ensure the success of the process by naming the exact activities, deadlines and people in charge.\r\nIn the courses chosen and pre-registered, our colleagues will have the opportunity to improve their language skills, visit educational institutions, work with an international team, and share their experiences about teaching. One course deals with content-based language teaching which helps the professional usage of the course-book used in our school. Each course deals with the possibilities in using ICT equipment and modern computer softwares in education today.\r\nAs a result of the project the planning of the pedagogical processes and the ability of expressing self-reflection connected to them will be improved among teachers. The results are planned to be spread extensively (by the head teacher, consultant-expert, language teachers) so they will have an effect on all the teachers teaching in the school. Supporting learning is emphasized among the teacher competences, which is based on learning to learn. During the project the teachers will improve the knowing and development of their own teaching methods. What the teachers have learnt will be implemented into the lessons and form periods, the knowledge will be passed on in meetings. Educational authority, teachers, children and also parents are in the target group. The results of the project will be presented on the blog of the project, eTwinning site, exhibitions, articles and reports.
