The consortium has successfully completed an Erasmus+ KA102 project between 2014 and 2016 (Building Bridges), and is currently engaged in a second Erasmus+ KA102 project (Building Bridges 2) that started in 2016 and will finish in August 2018. This project application is made for the continued possibility of Short term mobilities of VET learners and Staff training abroad, thus the name Building Bridges 3.  The experience of previous projects has been drawn on in this current application, and is expected to lead to further improvements in all aspects of the project.\r\nThe name is chosen because the project aims at building bridges between the Swedish consortium and the participating partner organisations, between schools and business, between different ways of working, between cultures and countries. In doing so, the applicant and the partners will continue to provide qualified and adequate placements for students and teachers in the EU. The application is aiming at the possibility for 88 students to do part of their VET-training in the partner countries, and for 8 teachers to do job-shadowing and exchanging experience in the same partner organisations. \r\nThe hosting partners are nine schools/VET providers in France, Spain, UK, Lithuania, Greece and Portugal, They have been selected to match the requirements of the consortium members. The consortium has well-established relations with the partner organisations, some from many years and some more recent. They are all based on long-term relationships, and the partners have been found to be reliable, with mutual areas of interest. The cooperation is of benefit for all involved. Several of the hosting partners in this application will apply for corresponding projects, and the project is expected to be the basis for a continued good cooperation between the applicant and the partners with mutual exchanges. \r\nWithin the consortium, there is natural interaction as all members belong to the same organisation, in addition there is a team of contact persons chaired by the coordinators EU-coordinator. The team meets for joint planning, follow-up and evaluation.\r\nParticipating students are expected to have improved knowledge within their field of work in a way that can be approved as part of their studies in accordance with the Swedish curriculum (Gy 11). They are given the opportunity to try their skills in a new context and surrounding, learn to adapt and become more independent, both professionally and socially, and become more motivated and accustomed to taking personal responsibility for their studies and for their work. This in turn provides greater opportunities for the completion of studies and future social inclusion. They take part of another culture and are made aware of the possibility to seek employment within the EU. They are developing their European identity and are given the possibility to use their linguistic abilities. Their employability is strengthened with an improved CV.\r\nThe teachers in the exchange acquire new skills and knowledge, both from learning from others and from reflecting on their own practices. They experience personal growth and new ways of thinking.  As the participating teachers are transforming the knowledge they acquire into their schools, it becomes a tool for organisational development and competency enhancement, not only for themselves, but for the organisation as a whole. This in turn contributes towards the use of best practices in teaching and training, as well as improved cooperation and strategies for collaboration with the students\u2019 future employers. \r\nThere is a great demand for staff with advanced vocational training, but the supplied knowledge and skills do not always meet the demand. The schools benefit from the cooperation and are able to adapt the elements in the education to better fit the needs of the business community, locally, nationally and on the extended European market.

The development of these social entrepreneurship competences will be achieved through an extensive ToT programme, provided though both the means of an e-learning tool and complementary classroom training. The ultimate goal of the project would be to develop an informal network of \u201csocial learning e-centres\u201d for educators/ trainers/ professionals working with migrant adults, through which the trained educators will be involved in engaging new peers to follow the training programme using the same capacity building mechanism. Thus, future educators will be equipped with social entrepreneurships skills, to be used as a basis for further training low-skilled adult migrants on entrepreneurship in the context of social growth.\r\nThe need to implement this project emerged from the fact that there is a growing recognition of the role that it can play in tackling societal and environmental challenges and fostering inclusive social growth. The EU social economy, according to the EC, has employed more than 11 million people, about 6% of the active workforce: out of these, 26% are employed in social enterprises. Meanwhile, employment in social enterprises increased by 8%, which is also a promising start to tackle unemployment and poor working conditions currently faced by migrants in EU member states. Social enterprises represent an excellent opportunity for creating new job opportunities for migrants, fostering their empowerment and enabling them to work in a fair and equal environment, including as entrepreneurs.\r\nOne of the challenges encountered for the further development of social enterprises, nevertheless, is the lack/inadequacy of entrepreneurial skills. Although social entrepreneurship increasingly gains interest among entrepreneurs, there is a significant lack of awareness around social enterprise principles and on social enterprise creation. Entrepreneurial education is not yet sufficiently integrated into the education system and most people lack the skills necessary for entering the modern business landscape. \r\nTo respond to the above needs, the project will build on the competitive advantages that arise from social entrepreneurship particularly in the new economic context that calls for inherently flexible approaches to create social impact through self-sustainability. \r\nThe objectives of the project are the following:\r\n\u2022 To enhance the background and knowledge of educators / professionals in social entrepreneurship fields, which will facilitate them in the long run to develop social entrepreneurial skills to learners with migrant background, \r\n\u2022 Improve the supply of high quality learning opportunities in the field of social entrepreneurship tailored to the needs of both educators with no prior relevant knowledge in the field, as well as of low-skilled adults with migrant background.\r\n\u2022 Increase the capacity of educators / professionals as trainers of trainers in social entrepreneurship \r\n\u2022 Promote the social entrepreneurship spirit and raise awareness on the alternative pathways to pursue self-sustainability\r\n\u2022 Increase labour market relevance of learning provision and qualifications and reinforce links among the world of social entrepreneurship with adult trainers and, ultimately, with migrant learners.\r\n\r\nThe primary target group of the project is educators/trainers and professionals working with adult migrants in organisations providing social and educational support to migrants. The project will also target Municipal Authorities, NGOs, Adult learning Centres, diaspora associations, and other relevant stakeholders. \r\nThe project\u2019s innovation and added value lies in the very fact that it does not merely seek to train trainers on social entrepreneurship teaching methods and practical thematic knowledge, through the means of an e-tool. The project goes beyond the mere e-learning and training of trainers scheme as it incorporates the innovative set up and activation of the network of informal social learning e-centres for educators/ trainers/ professionals working with migrant adults, through which the trained educators will be involved in engaging new peers to follow the capacity building programme using the same capacity building mechanism. \r\nThe validation and certification of the acquired skills of educators through the project\u00b4s non-formal learning activities will also equip them in offering high-quality teaching on social entrepreneurship both to new peers and potentially to migrants.", "http://www.pointeuropa.org", "Point Europa", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA204-036747_coordinator"], [2014, "Bridgeing the gap between European VET providers  and European employers through joint development of methods of collaboration - facilitate students access to the EU labour market through placements in schools and companies in member countries.", "Point Europa", 169385.0, 5, 7, "The applicant partner is the Upper Secondary and Adult Education of the City of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden.

On the occasion of a contact seminary  - Bordeaux, France, November 2008 - we got to meet representatives from equivalent institutions to ours, in terms of structure and training courses, among which the Vocational and Technical State school in Kartuzy, Poland.\r\n\r\nWe,  then, agreed on a partnership mode which materialized - within the framework of Leonardo Da Vinci Mobility, then Erasmus+ programmes - by trainee exchanges, placed in retail businesses, in Bergerac, then in Kartuzy, four times, between 2010 and 2014. On the same terms, twelve Polish students will, once again,  carry out an internship, in France, in September 2015.\r\n\r\nSince 2011, we have also undertaken a partnership with the Italian catering school IPSSAR Artusi, based in Riolo Terme, near Faenza, Emilia-Romagna.

Eight French students will take advantage out of a similar mobility experience, in March 2015. Placing us in a quality approach, we would like to include that cooperation into our Erasmus+ project, in the prospect of improving implementation and sustainability conditions.\r\n\r\nThanks to those experiences and aware of what is really at stake, for beneficiaries, in terms of professional increase in value and education to European citizenship, we intend to offer mobility experiences to students from every vocational training speciality taught in our school. For that purpose, we have initiated cooperation with two new partners : a British non-profit organisation and a Spanish school, who have assured us of their ability to materialize placement options, for the benefit of our Healthcare and Administration students.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the next step of our project would consist in providing a mobility experience to eight Commerce students, in Poland, and five Administration students, in Spain, in November 2015, for a four week internship. Then, our approach would lead to send eight Catering students to Italy, and five Healthcare students to Great-Britain, in March 2016, for a five week work experience.\r\n\r\nOur recent experiences and intense and ongoing collaborative work with our European conterparts allow us to guarantee the participants the best conditions for realising professional objectives, specified by academic curriculum, inherent in student training.

We intend to value the use of language skills in a professional context as well as in socializing situations, too.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration we intend to intensify with our European partners is part and parcel of that context.

We will accomplish this over the duration of the project by sending: 8 staff members and 16 VET learners to gain new skills and training in 4  VET organizations across Europe. \r\n\r\nVET staff  sometimes find that it is difficult to encourage learners  into training and into the workplace and our staff will learn new methods, approaches and tools that are used across Europe to increase the up take of VET courses. They will be able to establish what approaches our European partners use to incentive and motivate people to undertake VET courses. Through the job shadowing and training activities within the project our staff will be able to learn new skills, methods, techniques and approaches and cascade this learning through our organisation and consequently the impact and results will be used within the work they do with disadvantaged groups within our community. \r\n\r\nWe operate from an isolated, rural and socio-economically deprived region. There are limited employment and VET training opportunities and the socio-demographic, relative to national statistics is homogeneous. Young and older people alike, can be skeptical about the European Model in itself and can be less that sympathetic to 'others'. Our European mobility strategy has been developed by our staff in order for them to work with VET learners to broaden horizons, develop inter cultural personal and professional competences to combat racism and encourage active citizenship. In addition their knowledge and motivation of their chosen Vocational Training Course will be enhanced due to the new knowledge and experiences they will gain throughout the mobility.  In todays difficult economic climate and extremely high youth unemployment these learners will have a unique advantage when seeking to enter into the labour market. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of our target group, especially the young, have VET training but no or limited  work experience. Through \"Broader Horizons\"we will provide a short but valuable exposure to the specific skills required in their chosen work sector. Successful participation  for staff and learners in a transnational project can give participants the base to move on to new training, utilize skills gained and teaching methods, new energy for entering the labour market and perhaps the motivation to start self-employment and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n \r\nThrough transnational cooperation and partnership, the mutual benefits and impact of \"Broader Horizons\" will ensure a long lasting and sustainable legacy for future European cooperation projects.", "http://www.pointeuropa.org", "Point Europa", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA102-012291_coordinator"], [2014, "Your Culture My Culture Our Culture", "Point Europa", 22201.0, 2, 2, "\"Your Culture My Culture Our Culture\" is a youth exchange which will bring together 30 participants and 4 youth/social workers of Point Europa and Arbeiterkammer Tirol.

This ones have had little opportunities in life to engage positive activities, travel and meet other young people outside their country. These now planned exchanges will enable young people to experience a positive life-and learning opportunity and will allow young people to explore (youth) cultural issues that young people from Britain and Austria are facing in our society today. Lack of perspectives, discrimination, unemployment, rural isolation and lack on role models among others do not need to last  forever if we work on it.We set up a series of exchanges to allow young people to have a positive European Experience - either away or in their home country.We may even may need to call it an INCLUSION PROJECT (Within project responsibles)as it offers opportunities to all young people. No matter if they face challenges in their lives, will have to make sure that they have a chance to participate in these mobilities.We do not know, how Europe and our countries will develop after the 23rd of June, when the referendum of Britain to stay in or leave the EU is over. From our side we are more for the unifying then the separating spirit.We are very frightened, as we cannot predict what the consequences could be for us, for our countries and Europe.We think, that only cooperation and an European Spirit can solve the current crisis. Sour projects will also provide a forum for young people to make links and work together on projects and outings. We will use a variety of topics and tools such as debates, presentations but also dance, music and the arts. Such an experience will provide the opportunity for young people to gain confidence and increase their self esteem. It will be an effective learning experience and for some young people it will provide them with the first experience of meeting other young people living outside their own country. The programs will also provide learning workshops on what is Youth Culture, where young people are needed in our society and what young people can positively contribute to their communities and societies as a whole. The Objectives of this series of projects are to ensure the participants gain a better understanding ofculture. They will have the opportunity to understand differences and similarities of history and culture in Europe. The program will provide opportunities for young people to get to know each other and have fun working together as a team to create a final performance. The project focuses on people who face exclusion due to different factors (health, poverty, education, rural isolation and unemployment).It is important to mention, that in the UK youth service provision was cut dramtatcally, not many offers for international youthwork can be realized.Only the long lasting partnerships allow us, still to realize one or the other exchange, which would be so desperately needed to combat exclusion, xeno - and Europhobia.This projects are also to back the YES-remaining inititiave. Only a common Europe can assure values and standards. The projects will have same objectives and aims, they will have same and similar issues to tackle, but each project will do that in a different way. One by debatting, one by discovering the region and the other by reflecting on culture. The variety of activities and workshops, which are youth let as much as possible, will be provided for the young people to develop their knowledge around Culture, inclusion and diversity, valuing the differences and similarities within them.

On a practical side, more support such as methodological handbooks or diverse activities offering further exploration of advanced, participatory and sustainable approaches and underlying theories is needed. Therefore, a group of trainers, facilitators, youth workers, together with organisations working in this field developed this project to share and to further develop existing concepts, theories and approaches.The project is aiming at gathering around 20 educational experts from Germany, Austria, France, Czech Republic, Armenia, Serbia, Montenegro, UK and Belarus active in the European youth field (trainers, facilitators and youth workers) to explore together the issues mentioned above.The activity will be a  4 days' seminar taking place in Berlin to explore the current debates and developments in the different regions and in the frame of the work of the participants and the participating organisations. It aims to give impulses for further developments in the frame of European youth work and the Erasmus+ programme.The seminar programme will contain presentations - designed and delivered by the participants - concerning theories, concepts and methods in terms of (inter-)culture, ambiguity and change as well as the diversity and inclusion strategies in non-formal and international youth work in our countries. A fundamental element of the project will be the development of ideas to further qualify the field of non-formal learning in European youth work, concerning our topics.Another part will focus on the sharing of methods and approaches and the identification of common ground to be able to move forwards as a platform and produce effective outputs that will benefit young people across Europe. The methods will be very much non-formal and participatory as the main aim of the activity is sharing. The sharing of developments and methods needs participants to be involved in a meaningful and effective way, so there will be the encouragement of ownership and leadership of the content and the platform for all. A peer supervision approach will be developed for reflecting the practice and exploring challenges of our work. Interactive methods will be used throughout, with a focus on creative visual methods for many of the sessions, especially for the part of the programme relating to further development and finding ideas for dissemination and sharing of results.This project is thought to be a starting point for connection and development that will influence other trainers and youth workers across the continent, organisations in a broad range of countries and also European and international youth work as whole. Since all participants are very active in training and youth work in the European youth field we aim to contribute to a raise in quality in the field. We will provide ideas how to put life and fresh practice into the term \"diversity\", from a local practice level up to the international political level through connection to the European Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.Many professional trainers are very aware of the developments. They themselves already changed their pedagogical practice and their attitudes towards culture and diverse groups. This is in many ways already different from how it was 15 years ago. But due to the conditions and indisputable challenges of youth work these developments have not reached the majority of organisations and youth workers.
