This toolbox would provide (1) procedures, sampling methods and detection of CBRN agents at the crime scene, (2) traditional forensic laboratory methods for contaminated evidence and (3) laboratory methods for profiling the CBRN agents released at the incident. The procedures and methods are will be set up and validated according to ISO17025 and the system validation will be performed by a final exercise. Procedures for chain of custody, QC to ensure the integrity of the evidence and investigations done on the evidence from crime scene to court will be developed. An education and training curriculum related to the developed procedures, best practices and methods will be designed and progressed to implementation.\nUnderpinning the above aims, research will be carried out to develop novel methodologies to enable traditional forensic science (DNA, fingerprint and electronic devices) to be carried out on CBRN contaminated exhibits and analytical procedures to be carried out that not only provide information about the CBRN agent itself but also through CBRN profiling provide in-depth information which can give valuable forensic information, for example points of origin.\nThe project team includes forensic research laboratories, potential users of the expected developments, including public and private users, and SMEs who will be able to bring the new technologies developed within the project to market.'", 319878.0, 5645640.0, 9, 20, "GIFT CBRN", null, "http://www.cbrneworld.com", null, "fp7_192217_973083825"], [1325376000000, 1419984000000, "Improved First Responder Ensembles Against CBRN Terrorism", "Falcon Communications Limited", "IF REACT answers to the call SEC\u20102011.4.4\u20101 CBRN individual Protective Clothing where the task is \u201cto develop innovative protective clothing for first responders and/or for the public in case of a CBRN crisis.\u201d\nIF REACT takes both the danger of terrorist attacks using CBRN\u2010means and releases other than attack, such as pandemic outbreaks, accidents and other incidents involving dangerous substances, into account in order to achieve its main goal of developing innovative protective clothing for first responders.\nFollowing a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of existing equipment, IF REACT has chosen to\nfocus on the most emergent threats and to fulfil the needs of the end users who are in greatest need\nof innovative protection.

Our idea is to reduce the bio-filter recovery time after failure by developing an Intelligent Biofilter Control (IBC) system.

At healthy period excess bacteria are extracted, prepared for storage and stored by automatic collection system. In case of biofilter failure, the stored culture will be cultivated for rapid recovery of the biofilter thereby providing increased productivity of the farm. The major barriers to overcome are: (a) Biofilter start-up and recovery processes in fish farm are slow, taking 3-6 weeks. (b) Methods of bacteria extraction and storage are designed for usage in laboratory and not providing the efficiency required for industrial applications; (c) Limited knowledge about how is the recovery performance of recultivated bacteria related to the health before collection; (d) Existing methods to assess the viability and metabolic activity of bacteria are complicated and time consuming. We intend to overcome these barriers by speeding up the recovery of a bio-filter by recultivating the stored adapted bacteria.
