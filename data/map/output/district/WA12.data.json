We are currently preparing for the compulsory teaching of French and weekly French lessons are  delivered to our junior children by a native French speaking language assistant. Some French is also taught in the infants by the class teachers. Our aim is to raise the profile of teaching and learning languages and increase intercultural understanding. We also aim to promote of French by cross-curricular learning and the development of a range of exciting, authenticate resources for use throughout school. Through participation in this course, we will establish and maintain a personal link with a partner school in France. Three members of staff will take part in immersion courses over a period of two years,enabling us to maintain a personal link with the French school. The members of staff will be chosen by the SLT through a fair selection process, taking into account their enthusiasm for developing their language skills and cultural understanding. Their readiness to share the experience and their findings with children, staff, governors and parents on their return from France will also be taken into consideration. We have carefully selected a course by a reputable course provider that meets the particular needs  of our school. The provider will arrange a visit to a partner school in France and also enable us to make contact with the school prior to our visit. The course provider will also offer ongoing support both before and during the course. We expect that participation in immersion courses over a rolling programme of two years and the development of a personal link with a partner school in France will have a positive impact on the teaching and learning of French in our school. Skills gained on the courses will be cascaded through school and the impact will be regularly assessed. In addition, intercultural understanding will be significantly raised throughout school. Corresponding with pen pals will also impact positively on the children's learning, giving a real purpose to learning a language as well as enthusing all children. Furthermore, participating in this course will lead to a greater understanding of an education system in another European country.", "http://www.st-peters.st-helens.sch.uk", "St Peter's CE Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000142_coordinator"]]}}}}
