By completing foreign mobilities, pupils will get an overview of the functioning of the labour market in England and the Czech Republic, entrepreneurship opportunities, rights and obligations of entrepreneurs, principles of the real estate business, information about career growth opportunities and youth employment promotion, social policy and the social system in England, the functioning and operating conditions, as well as of the charitable organization financing system, a brief overview of the subsidy policy, learn about English language teaching methods, about the importance of marketing whether in personal life or in a working business environment.

Around 180 million tonnes per year of products are extracted in the EU, with an estimated contribution of \u20ac10 billion to European GDP and offering direct employment to some 42,500 people.  A secure supply of sustainable mineral products is essential to maintaining the European mining, mineral and manufacturing industries.\n\nThe main objective of STOCISM is to enhance the competitiveness of the European industrial minerals industry by developing cleaner, more energy efficient extraction and processing technologies.  STOICISM is an industry-led project with a specific focus on calcined industrial minerals which are presently energy intensive to produce.  Most calcining uses the direct combustion of fossil fuels, contributing to up to 85% of their carbon emissions.\n\nTo meet the overall aim, three key calcined industrial minerals have been identified: diatomaceous earth; perlite and kaolin.  The processes implemented can also then be directly transferable to many other industrial minerals. In global terms, the EU produces one third of the world\u2019s production of perlite, 20% of calcined kaolin and 20% of diatomite.  Key markets for these minerals are beverage filtration, coatings, plastic, rubber, cosmetics, insulation and construction materials. STOICISM will research, develop and demonstrate a range of new innovative technologies along the industrial minerals value chain. This will include developments in extraction, beneficiation, drying, calcining and waste recycling.\n\nSTOICISM is expected to impact significantly on the sustainability of the EU\u2019s industrial minerals industry by decreasing the use of natural resources (both mineral deposits and energy resources) leading to the sustainable production of better and purer products with less waste and lower environmental impact.", 505.0, 6859720.0, 8, 17, "STOICISM", "http://www.stoicism.eu/", "http://www.fullers.co.uk", null, "fp7_106426_952900938"]]}}, "2RG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Zdobywam do\u015bwiadczenie zawodowe w krajach Unii Europejskiej.", "Morgan Oates Ltd.", 63944.0, 3, 3, "The project \u201eGaining experience in European Union countries\u201d is written for students at Vocational or Technical Secondary School in Przodkowo (ZSP).
