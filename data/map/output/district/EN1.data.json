The OECD/INFE report Financial Trends in Europe, 2016), reported:\r\n\u2022 A quarter of adults had problems with calculating the simple interest on savings\r\n\u2022 The vast majority could not calculate the interest on savings after 5 years\r\n\u2022 There were issues with identifying risk and return\r\n\u2022 Over 30% could did not understand the concept of diversification \r\n\r\nIf adults are to navigate the increasingly complex and digitalised world of finance they will require the competences for day to day financial transactions to obtain better value for their money, better protect themselves from financial fraud, and \r\nhelp secure their financial future. \r\n\r\nEducators have a major role to play in helping develop citizens\u2019 financial competence. However, if they are to do so effectively, they themselves will need to be financially competent, as developing financially competent citizens requires financially competent educators. Yet, this area has received little attention in terms of policy, resources or initiatives to prepare and train financial educators.   \r\n\r\nAgainst this background, this project, Financial Education for Educators aims to build capacity in organisations providing financial education by empowering the organisations and their staff to deliver high quality training in financial and economic literacy.  Within this broad aim, the main objectives are to: \r\n1.. Provide a comparative analysis of the preparation of financial educators in Europe, North America and Australia to inform the future training and preparation of financial educators \r\n2. Formulate a financial and economic competence framework for educators \r\n3. Improve the financial and economic competences of at least 14 adult educators to deliver financial education to adults\r\n4. Provide opportunities for adult educators to improve and update their competence to deliver financial training though an e-course in financial and economic literacy. \r\n5. Create a course that could confer \u201ccertified financial educator\u201d status on successful completion.\r\n\r\nThis project will begin to address the issue of the preparation of financial educators by developing strategies, and tools and training programmes to help educators develop financial and economic competence so they can facilitate the development of adults\u2019 financial competence.

When compared to other EU countries, Poland places itself in an extremely unfavourable position. Low social participation is accompanied by deficits in the sphere of e-Government.  Although great endeavours have been made over the last 10 years to implement change, the lack of systems approach and existing barriers in the area seem to prevail, one of them being a deficit of specialists with practical experience and adequate knowledge of potential solutions. The situation becomes even worse as there seem to be no relevant curricula provided by universities that would be practically-oriented and that would use effective teaching methods like workshops, simulations, etc.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe project proposed by the consortium has been conceived to fill in this gap and contribute to the increase of knowledge and skills related to e-Government among project participants, young people in particular.

The base will take a form of an online catalogue and will include resources developed through the analysis of strategic documents, outcomes of research projects and evaluation of selected e-Gov 1.0 and e-Gov 2.0 implementations. A teaching methodology for e-Government 2.0 will be developed. Subsequently curricula along with related courses (and syllabi) will be prepared.

We aim for all staff and pupils from year 3 - year 6 to be involved as it is not possible to achieve the aim of making the European/Spanish Dimension a key part of our school life without involving everyone. To this end, we hope that by participating in further courses, more staff will engage with developing the use of Spanish across the curriculum. In addition to the courses in October 2016, we will arrange visits for our Y5 pupils and develop and share resources with our partner school. In the longer term, we hope that our new members of staff will join our project so ensuring its longevity. We also aim to use these courses to support the professional development of staff, particularly in project management, curriculum planning and the leading of working groups. Our school is very much a community school where the parents are engaged with the work of the school and we aim to involve them in such things as curriculum days, the Madrid visits by pupils and by ensuring they understand the importance to the school of this approach.Our project will be inclusive of all and will give status to those involved through leading the project, designing new curriculum material and disseminating and evaluating the outcomes. All participants will enhance their language competence, develop their leadership skills, hone their training skills, improve their cultural understanding and ensure that the pupils receive the highest quality of support in Spanish. This will enthuse and motivate the pupils to love languages and to continue with their learning, at least to GCSE. This will be monitored long term through the connections at the local secondary schools.", "http://www.honilands.co.uk", "LBE Honilands Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023639_coordinator"]]}}, "4UF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Developing staff and pupil's linguistic skills", "Worcesters Primary School", 12787.0, 1, 1, "Worcesters began a partnership with a school in Madrid in 2013 which involved several members of staff visiting our partner school school at different times of the year. The coordinator from that school has also had the opportunity to visit us at Worcesters. These opportunities have helped us to build a good foundation between the schools. Following my involvement in this project and as the Modern Foreign Languages coordinator, I have been able to support Worcesters in improving its implementation of Spanish and introducing Spanish to Year1 and Reception. \r\nThe aim of this project is to further develop Worcesters teaching of Spanish in both the language and the culture. We aim to have more fluent and confident Spanish speakers and that the children will have a much better understanding of how different the Spanish culture is to ours in the UK. We will continue to develop this partnership for the next 2 years as part of this project as this will enable us to continue to build upon our links with our partner school in Spain and to give various members of staff the opportunity to participate and improve their knowledge and skills.\r\nBefore we begin the activities, the tasks and the agenda will be shared between myself and the coordinator in our partner school to ensure that both schools are aware and in agreement with the aims and what the staff will be doing during this project. The staff will meet with me to obtain their tasks and any maps and routes to the school so I can ensure that the travel arrangements are clear. \r\nThe first activity, October 2015, will involve the participation of 3 members of staff, myself, the EYFS and Year 1 phase Leader and the EMA coordinator. During this activity the staff members will have the opportunity to observe lessons in our partner school that are taught in both Spanish and in English. This will give the staff an opportunity to identify different methods and strategies that are utilized in Spain with regards to teaching a language. Resulting from this, the EYFS and Year 1 phase leader will be able to support the  staff and the teaching of Spanish in her phase and the EMA coordinator will be able to support our school in improving our pupils skills in speaking Spanish more fluently. \r\nIn order for Worcesters to better develop its implementation of Spanish, our staff's confidence and knowledge must also be supported and developed  further. Our second activity, Easter 2016, will involve 3 different members of staff taking part in the same activities as stated above which will make it possible for more members of staff to improve their skills. \r\nThe final activity, Easter 2017, will again involve 3 members of staff who will build on the experiences of those who attended course 1.\r\nBefore each activity takes place the adults will complete a baseline assessment of their language skills.

This will especially help to develop our Year 4 pupils who study about Spain in the autumn term. \r\nThe staff at Worcesters will be regularly updated with the progress of the project through staff meetings carried out by myself so that everyone is clear what the aims, intentions and findings have been. This will also help to ensure that all members of staff are more confident and  supported in their teaching of Spanish which will lead to more confident and fluent Spanish speakers.
