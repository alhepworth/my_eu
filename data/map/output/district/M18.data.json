Then there is a big fluctuation in the positions. This is a field where people do not stay so long and people are changing a lot because projects are not something with continuity - there are breaks between project and this is much more valid for youth exchanges. Somebody who is sent now as a leader will not be available again next month/year. To conclude, that is clear, there is a need for a flexible training system to prepare youth workers in narrow fields of Erasmus+: EVS (mentors, facilitators), coordinators, leaders in youth exchanges.\r\n\r\nThrough open and innovative practices in digital area such as of gamification of learning or Open Educational Resources it aims at achievement of relevant and high quality skills and competences. Its activities will promote quality youth work through 10 innovative approaches, among them ETS model of competences, creation of intercultural-virtual-community out of 4 non-formal networks of learning and innovative inter-connection between world of youth work and employment. \r\n\r\nThe features of the project include following characteristics: framework of MOOC, usage of OER, adapted KOLB learning cycle to e-learning rules and products of the project such as e-books and e-games for open use. \r\n\r\nThe project will consist of 5 partners from 4 countries and will result in development of 4 innovative online course for 4 positions in youth work.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the \u201cOnline Training Courses for E+ Youth Workers\u201d project, for two years are the followings:\r\n\u25cf To develop online course for the project managers in E+ projects;\r\n\u25cf To develop online course for the mentors in EVS;\r\n\u25cf To develop online course for the facilitators in EVS;\r\n\u25cf To develop online course for the leaders in youth exchanges;\r\n\u25cf To create 4 non-formal networks - communities of practices;\r\n\r\nThe participants to these training course will have two entry levels: basic and advanced.

This gives a youth unemployment rate of 23.0 %. It should also be recorded here that there are no appreciable difference in neighbouring EU countries as lots of young people in these regions wait anxiously to migrate into EU thereby causing more unemployment challenges. \r\n\r\nYouths unemployment and exclusion from economic main stream in EU and neighbouring EU countries demands a strategic review, with commitment to contribute to EU's strategic aim at reducing youth unemployment, increase youth-employment rate in line with the wider EU target of achieving a 75% employment rate.\r\n\r\nThe  international project - \u201cCollaborative Economy for Youth Work\u201d is a two-level ERASMUS+ project, that fights against the pessimistic view of the current situation, which leads young people to social exclusion, and presents itself as an opportunity to develop new attitudes, presenting social and business actions that can contribute to change, in time when these are extremely necessary.\r\n\r\nThere is a Spanish proverb that says \u201chunger sharpens the wit\u201d, that can explain the big repercussion and growth of a new movement called \u201ccollaborative consumption (CC)\u201d or \u201csharing economy\u201d. For example we can find barter trade markets, car/bike/house sharing, coworking, crowdfunding, couchsurfing, peer to peer lending and renting, even virtual currencies. But what happens if we introduce this concept in the field of youth work? Can we meet the needs that the actual economic situation has created, and use these new methodologies of sharing to improve the quality of the youth work projects? The answer is YES!  CC is quate new tool in youth work and thats why we would like to implement this project to make it grow and get bigger and bigger. \r\n\r\nThe projects contains 2 levels, first TC and second Youth Exchange.  The project  will analyze the sharing movement and equip youth workers with new tools that will help them to use these platforms in concrete projects at local and international level.\r\n\r\n1. TC - \"Collaborative consumption, New word in Youth work\" takes place in Manchester, UK during 10 - 16th of April, 2015. The training is  about -  collaborative consumption (CC) - the new class of economic arrangements, where the participants share access to products or services, rather than having individual ownerships. CC especially in times of crisis, is the perfect tool that could be used also for youth work.   the 1st stage of the project - TC - is more concentrated on giving information about different types and methods of shared economy, on the 2nd stage (YE) the most motivated and active participants of the TC will be leaders of YE.  \r\n\r\n2. YE - \"Sharing Unites Everyone\" takes place in Bakuriani, Georgia, during 10-17 May, 2015. After the 1st stage the participants will get the task to experiment different models of CC in their lives and work. Especially important part for YE will be financial contribution of \"Crowd funding\" realized by the participants themselves. On YE the most of the participants will already have some experience of Sharing Economy and the aim of the project is to promote CC, implement in practice some of the models during the project, produce the manual - \"CC for youth work\" and spread it widely, in order to give possibility to other youngsters, youth workers and associations to use the same opportunities.\r\n\r\nIts a fact that Collective Consumption has already entered into youngsters' live in Europe. They move using carsharing or bikesharing, use couchsurfing instead of a hostel,  use exchange platforms, buy second hand goods, instead of renting an office , fund their books, videos,  maybe is just a minority but is growing fast. CC creates big curiosity between youngsters and not only, is trendy; as is new, interactive and playful and is a perfect way to promote active citizenship and rise environmental awareness between youngsters. It is very important for partner countries, where most of those models do not even exist, or are replaced by traditional system.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to:\r\n\u2022Raise awareness towards CC and promote its idea\r\n\u2022Promote use of CC tools in youth work and create the manual\r\n\u2022Work on and practice the concept of collective sharing,CC, social economy\r\n\u2022Provide creative and innovative tools against the crisis\r\n\u2022Strengthen entrepreneurship, creativity and initiative of youth\r\n\u2022Share the best practices of youth work and NFE\r\n\u2022Promote intercultural exchange, tolerance and solidarity\r\n\u2022Prepare future YE leaders\r\n\u2022Promote Erasmus+ and cooperation between EU & partner countries\r\n\u2022Build new partnerships\r\n\r\nProject methodology is based on non-formal education and peer to peer education, valorizing the knowledge and experiences of the youngsters.\r\nCountries involved in project: Georgia, UK, Germany, Spain, Poland, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon", "http://www.vision2020leadershipinitiative.btik.com", "V2020 (VISION 2020 LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE)", "erasmus_2014-3-UK01-KA105-011974_coordinator"], [2015, "Path to Employment Project", "V2020 (VISION 2020 LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE)", 32920.0, 8, 8, "\"Path to Employment\" is two stage project, aiming to support youth development and employment in EU, EECA and EURO-MED Regions.  First Stage of the project is Training Course \"Development for Employment\", which will take place in Manchester, UK, during 65- 11 July, 2015. The second stage is Youth Exchange \"Integration + \" which will take place  in Bakuriani, Georgia during September 5 - 12 September, 2015 (APV in Tbilisi, Georgia, during 28-30 July, 2015).\r\n\r\nThe main idea to organize such kind of project was caused by the current situation regarding the youth employment. According to  the latest researches the largest problem of modern Europe is the high level of youth unemployment. There can be named several aspects which has caused the present situation. but as most of the experts argue the crucial thing is that, youngsters are not having enough skills to get employed too. They do not have enough personal or professional experience to find there way in the competitive job market. \r\nErasmus+ is offering a lot of tools which can resolve this problem and project - Guide for Employment aims to prove it.  \r\n\r\nThe overall  aim of  two stage  project \"Path to Employment\" is to give youngsters opportunity to learn more about Erasmus+, active citizenship,  find themselves as main actors of social development, encourage them to participate in youth work and gain experience which will finally help them get employed. It will be kind of personal development course for youngsters who are just in the way of choosing future professions and they will get sessions which will help them to develop their career; give them basic skills how to write CV and motivation letter, how to make self presentation, how to act during the interview. they will learn importance of leadership and team work, creativity, time management and project management. they will try to work with peers with fewer opportunities, they will sea the advantage of inclusion and cooperation. At the end of each stage (TC or YE) they will have chance to plan future projects together and work on the most problematic issues they face in their society. \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the TC are:\r\n\u2022 To promote Erasmus+\r\n\u2022 Help youngsters develop themselves as active citizens and future youth workers\r\n\u2022 To reduce the youth unemployment;\r\n\u2022 To promote integration/inclusion\r\n\r\nTraining Course (First Stage) \"Development for Employment\" will bring together 27 youngsters from 8 different countries  with the aim to help newly graduated youngsters to gain basic knowledge about very useful things, for example: how to write CV and motivation letter, how to make self presentation and presentation in general; how to act during interview; main aspects of  leadership and team work, creativity, time management and project management. they will have chance to plan, participate and learn about different youth activities, which is helping them to develop.  During the training Course they will be informed about all the activities which can be implemented under Erasmus + and they will be able to be actively involved in this program. At the same time they will see real examples how active citizenship and volunteering can be useful. hosting organization will arrange a meeting with youth workers, ex- volunteers who had started to be very active in different fields and during this process made  important personal contacts which later helped them to get job offers. It will be a sharing of best practice. \r\n\r\nYouth Exchange (Second stage)  \"Integration+\" will bring together 40 youngsters from 8 different countries and the main target group will be youngsters with fewer opportunities. the most active and motivated participants of TC will come as leaders, but in each group there will be at least 2 people with fewer opportunities. Ex- participants of TC  will have chance to use theoretical background of the TC and share it with others.  Than all participants of YE will be able to lead same kind of sessions in Schools of rural areas of Georgia. it will be a good example of peer education.  besides it is very important to say that youngsters coming from orphan houses are having even more obstacles in the way of employment. In Georgian reality mainly they are learning how to make handmade souvenirs, but it is also big challenge to reach the users. So, participants of YE will teach them how to make good project out of good idea, how to implement it and with the help of organizers they will make exhibition/festival/market of their handmade souvenirs.  as a result participants of YE will learn how to create beautiful and unique things with their own hands and also they will use their knowledge of project development in practice. they will be in charge of implementation this idea with the monitoring of organizers. \r\nThe learning methods of project will be through non-formal and in-formal education.

The main purpose of dancing is expressing yourself, trying to make what you feel a visible thing; we can dance for health and exercise benefits, as a spiritual expression or simply to connect socially.\r\nMore and more young people are closed in apartments sit in front of computers and infinitely major games that have little to do with real life.

To learn how to sport his/her own body, breath sports discipline can be with a smile, without much difficulty.\r\nHere are seven main reasons that are clear evidence of the benefits of Dance:\r\n1. Promoting health - Modern medicine claims that dance classes are optimal training for the heart , blood vessels, muscles and joints. \r\n2 . Correct and beautiful posture - In today's world in more than 50 % of people have back problems . Due to these problems disappear dance and develops a correct posture\r\n3 . Beautiful , elegant gait - An important factor in the formation of the external image of man is his manner of walking.\r\n4 . Sense of rhythm and musicality development\r\n5 . External beauty and good mood - Dancing will open you the secret of how the \"gray mouse\" turned into a mysterious and attractive man. Thanks to a new view of the hair, clothes , and even for women and make you feel that now is not deprived of the attention of others who simply can not tear away from you admiring glances.\r\n6.

Since the group leaders are prepared to work within an international environment it is also important to give them an international environment to apply their skills.
