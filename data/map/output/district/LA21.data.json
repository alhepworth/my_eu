The project consists of two phases. The first phase will be carried out in the form of an educational conference and the second phase in the form of a youth exchange that will serve as a final result and the realisation of ideas and findings of the conference in phase one. \r\nIn addition to C\u0160OD from Slovenia, who will coordinate the project, other partners will participate in both phases of the project, namely from Norway, Lithuania, Romania, Portugal, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Great Britain, Poland, Austria, Finland, Chech Republic and Iceland. Each of 14 partner organisations will send at least two youth workers to the conference. There will be 6 young people and 1 group leader to the youth exchange from 7 partner organisations. From Slovenia there will be one additional group leader, as we will include young participants with special needs that need their own escort. The project will also include among its participants one young member of the Roma minority and one young refugee, as well as youth workers from fields dealing with these two groups.\r\nAt the conference we will demonstrate and train youth workers on how to use modern technology beneficially, what we lose and what we gain by such use, and how to improve their digital competences for outdoor work with young people. Also present at the conference will be experts from universities from Slovenia and other European countries, who will present expert research on use of modern technology when working with young people. In addition, we will exchange good practices of our respective organisations from local environments and get to know new forms and methods of work with young people through use of modern technologies.\r\nThrough the youth exchange, we will demonstrate to youth workers and young people the problem of addiction to digital tehnology and the internet with the aim of deterring them from improper and excessive internet use and showing them how to protect their identities and themselves in a cyber environment. We will show them how to approach socialisation and forming real friendships. Based on experiences gained, we will discover how we can improve and increase the beneficial effects of digital technology and internet use. We will also learn how to create content for C\u0160OD Misija, a mobile app that will serve as an example of beneficial use of modern technology in everyday life by using modern technologies and different learning approaches to explore new fields of learning.\r\nFor the youth exchange our priority will be to include young people from socially endangered families and from rural and underdeveloped areas. During the project duration the young participants will also engage in sports activities, socialise with young people from the local environment and organise social evenings. One of such events, the country and national food presentation, will be especially aimed at developing intercultural competences and learning how to embrace cultural diversity.", "http://www.lowbank.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SI02-KA105-014532_10"]]}}, "8AE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Senior Plus", "View From Here Ltd", 172522.0, 5, 6, "Senior Plus is a 2 year strategic partnership project involving 6 organisations from 5 different European countries: Cemea del Mezzogiorno (ITALY) as applicant and coordinator, Pistes Solidaires (FRANCE), Associa\u00e7ao Mais Cidadania (PORTUGAL), Community Action Dacorum (UNITED KINGDOM), Gulbene Municipality (LATVIA), View from Here (UNITED KINGDOM) as knowledge partner. Senior Plus deals with adults aged more than 50 years, unemployed or inactive, in the need to enhance their employability.\r\nActive ageing means helping people stay in charge of their own lives for as long as possible as they age and, where possible, to contribute to the economy and society. Nowadays this concept has to be extended to people aged 50+, particularly exposed to long-term unemployment and poverty once they dropped out from labour market. The blows dealt by the economic crisis made evident all the limits of social security cushion, claiming for new tools enabling seniors to assess and re-design their medium-term perspective.

The EOE (the European Institute of Outdoor Adventure Education and Experiential Learning) is celebrating its 20th anniversary. This indicates changes of an entire generation and it is a good reason to reflect the huge amount of experience with outdoor methods and concepts. In the centre of the project is the seminar which will take place at the ULSZ Rif/Salzburg Austria. It lasts from September 7th to 11th 2015.\r\n\r\nAt least 50 experts of theory and practice in Outdoor Adventure Education and Experiential Learning from 11 countries will prepare inputs and come together to discuss four main issues:\r\n\r\n1. Certification and regulation: In the context of professionalisation of (further) education, diploma, accreditations, MSc and so on are getting more and more important. Do certifications really improve the quality of work, reduce risks and enhance educational and therapeutic processes? Do they really fulfil what they are promising for the target groups?\r\n\r\n2. Economization: The economic crises don\u00b4t stop in the face of education. The Pisa shock still leads to quick, unconscious and reflex reaction of the policy in order to \u201coptimize\u201d education. The focus changed from \u201cBildung\u201d to learning outcomes. Education was made measurable -  firstly regarding the competences of children, later on regarding the competences of teachers, hoping that both are substantially linked. Is evaluation the beginning of more transparency of working results, or the end of education, joy and happiness that are crucially linked to learning and emotional liveliness? \r\n\r\n3. Didactization: Educational engagement starts with powerful ideas and visions, personal enthusiasm and a strong relationship to individuals we work with. Bringing those ideas forward, we reflect our work on learning theories and developmental concepts and try to make them applicable. With the focus on economization and professionalisation methods get more and more standardized and uniformed. So nothing can go wrong - except education and development?!\r\n\r\n4.  Consultancy: The more problems a society seems to have the more \u201cassistance systems\u201d are established to solve them. Division of labour and distribution of tasks lead to an over- coaching of people in many life circumstances. Is outdoor adventure education also following this trend embarrassing children in their experimental learning by educating them how to do this?\r\nThe results will be distributed by seminar reports, networks and new protects.\r\n\r\nThe seminar aims to bring together experts and practitioners to share theoretical knowledge and experience, and to discuss and\r\nexchange good practice, in order to develop innovatove and significant ways of working with young people in the outdoors.
