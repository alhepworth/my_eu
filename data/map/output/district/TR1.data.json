The main theme of the seminar is Green Care and what benefits it brings to the field of youth work and in particular how Green Care methods and activities can provide help for humans and in particular NEETs.\r\nSeminar will enable participants to learn new skills, create new networks, and find empowerment from nature and animals. The themes of the seminar are based on Holistic Wellbeing, Youth, NEET, Nature and Animals and the program is built around Green Care methods and activities. Specific objectives of the seminar are: Green Care Methods and Knowledge in Youth Sector & Facts and Figures, How to sustain and increase holistic wellbeing? and Ways to help and support a young person in a NEET situation? \r\nSeminar will include practical, hands-on and non-formal learning. In addition there will be several workshops and exchange of good practices. The seminar will also include expert lecturers from partners and non-formal educators from Piispala and partners. Participants will be able to learn and hear the latest research information related to effects that nature and animals have on human wellbeing and test the methods and activities in practice. \r\nThis seminar wants to bring together participants that have experience in the field of youth work and with NEETs and who want to develop their competences and are interested in finding new methods and ways to help young people in their area and to develop the youth work in their area. In addition this project seeks participants that can exchange good practices. The expected impact is that the participants would find the methods they learned eye opening and that they would start using them in practice in their home countries in their work with young people. And that they would pass along the knowledge. We also expect that this seminar would act as an inspiration to learn more about the concept and in the future the participants would like to develop the activities they conduct even further and would maintain the international contacts and networks they created in this seminar for a long time. Also the goal is that this seminar would act as a springboard for further co-operation in Erasmus+ projects between the partners and participants and that the network created between the partner organizations would be a fruitful one and would mean a lot more projects in the future and therefore create long term benefits.", "http://chaosgroupcornwall.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-2-FI01-KA105-047353_5"]]}}, "1TN": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Formaci\u00f3n Europea y desarrollo profesional del profesorado", "Penair School", 13836.0, 3, 5, "EUROPEAN TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHERS\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\nThe HUELIN Secondary School in Malagais carrying out a CLIC programme. It has ICT provision, IT assistant initial voca courses with experience in Computer and participation in European programs. These features convey constant and demanding challenges to maintain quality levels to ensure continuous improvement in the linguistic , technological, educational and internationalization fields.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES , PARTICIPANTS AND METHODOLOGY\r\nTraining of teachers in this project arise through two strategies :\r\n\r\nA1 .

A. fumigatus is a ubiquitous mould whose spores are airborne and thus frequently inhaled. Humans with impaired immunity, e.g. those with haematological malignancies or bone marrow transplant recipients, are at a dramatically increased risk of severe, invasive A. fumigatus infection known as invasive aspergillosis (IA). IA is a rare disease in Europe but causes tremendous costs to the public health sector. Currently definitive diagnosis of IA is only obtained at autopsy or relies on invasive biopsy, an extremely unpleasant procedure which is not always applicable in suffering patients. Thus, a convenient, fast and specific diagnosis of IA is not available forcing clinicians to administer antifungal drugs on spec if a standard antibiotic treatment failed to reduce fever in risk patients. It would be of high financial benefit for clinics and has the potential to increase the survival rates of immuno-compromised patients, if a definitive diagnosis of IA could be obtained early and its response to treatment be monitored. This would allow applying the correct therapy at a dose and duration exactly tailored to patient needs. Equally important is the development of new treatment options which can replace existing systemic antifungal drugs with their known severe side effects. The approach of the consortium is to develop new disease specific tracers based on monoclonal antibodies along with the combined molecular imaging technologies PET/MR and PET/CT. Newly developed tracers shall then be functionalised by a combined labelling with radio-isotopes allowing diagnostic PET imaging but also immuno-radiotherapy, thus representing truly anti-infectious theranostics.

Therefore special focus in finding hosts in these areas was carried out.  \r\n\r\n(3) Disseminating information about Transnational Mobility: Information about transitional mobility was provided through various means, including the publication of pin house newsletters,  press articles and interviews of members of the Erasmus Core Group on both television and radio. \r\n\r\n(4) Carrying out the Work Placements: For the 2016 Erasmus Project, calls were issued internally and interviews were carried out. As soon as participants were identified, the Erasmsus+ Core Group matched the placements with the chosen candidates and  started working on a detailed and tailor-made work programme together with the host, the participant and the respective Line Manager. \r\n\r\n(5) Dissemination of Knowledge Obtained: In 2017 two placements were carried out and the knowledge obtained was disseminated.  A press release was issued to disseminate information about these placements externally.\r\n\r\n(6) Post mobility Follow up: Post mobility follow up will be held through one to one sessions with the participants to to gather initial feedback on the overall experience and to assess and validate that the knowledge, skills and competences identified in the beginning of the process have been acquired. In addition, an assessment of both the informal and non-formal learning will take place, including the identification of learning outcomes which were not originally planned but still achieved during the mobility projects.

These strategies include improving and enhancing employability skills, whilst developing entrepreneurial mind sets through innovational training elements and vocational learning experiences. Learners & staff will experience real time business projects working alongside startups and established entrepreneurs to develop employability skills from communication to project management and research to implementation, as well as receiving vocational training on how to create and launch a business from scratch developing technical skills from website creation to online social media marketing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVET Learners\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTruro and Penwith College, if successful with the funding application, will recruit 60 learners selected from a range of course focuses including Business, Administration, IT and Marketing. The college will aim to select learners up to the age of 20 highlighted at risk of NEET. The initial aim of the project in question is to develop the learners core employability skills and initiative to drive entrepreneurial spirit and a new innovative approach to their professional development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 28 day programme will blend real time business projects with entrepreneurial training with clear goals to develop a range of technical skills and professional attributes. Business professionals will act at mentors alongside the IEP training staff to allow maximum development for the learners. The learners will work within IEP vocational training facility on both the real time business projects, set and mentored by local entrepreneurs and startups and training on entrepreneurship and startup tools and creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll parties involved with the project will maintain strong communication channels with the selected learners to keep high quality thresholds and impact on those attending the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccess to funding will allow long term impacts to learners to enhance key employability skills and potential new business creation through innovation. Learners will be equipped with a new set of skills not previously gained through academic experiences or previous vocational opportunities. Results will see an increase in initiative and confidence within business environments, but will also develop core employability strengths within a vocational setting. There will also be the potential of real time business ideas created and developed whilst on the 28 day DRIVE Programme and will in turn impact on local economy and employment pool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVET Staff\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 5 staff will be selected from the current Employability and Innovation Team to further develop their skill sets in delivering innovative vocational training programmes in the field of Employability and Entrepreneurship.

The staff will shadow IEP mentors and staff and learn new innovative approaches to teaching business startup and employability skill improvement in a vocational environment. The staff will develop their own understanding and confidence in replicating similar entrepreneurial environments on their return to the UK and their own establishments. IEP will share materials and knowledge to enable the most impact during the 7 day period. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long term benefits may be seen in more innovative approaches to teaching and training methods within domestic VET institutes and new techniques implemented within vocational settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a real opportunity to further develop the 28 day DRIVE Programme as we are looking at a sustainable training model where such innovative projects can be replicated within our own and other training facilities in Cornwall and across Europe.
