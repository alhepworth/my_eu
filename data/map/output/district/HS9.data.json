Formed by calcium rich sand being blown onto acidic soil, the habitat has been keenly influenced by land management practices among the traditional crofting and farming communities, with extensive grazing and low intensity crop rotations. The machair also supports a wide range of wading birds in extremely high densities [such as ringed plover (<i>Charadrius hiaticula</i>) and dunlin (<i>Calidris alpina schinzii</i>)], while also providing suitable habitat for a range of other Annex 1 Birds Directive migratory species (such as Corncrake [<i>Crex crex</i>] and chough [<i>Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax</i>]). In recent years there has been a shift towards more intensive agriculture, with greater use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, which threatens this unique habitat. The areas where machair is found are also facing problems with de-population with people leaving agriculture to seek employment opportunities away from the rural community.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3540", "http://www.machairlife.org.uk/,", "life_280"]]}}}}
