Only in Europe, each year 2 400 infants still die of SIDS, an unexpected disease happening to infants who die in their sleep with no evidence of accidental asphysia, inflicted injury or organic disease; being a multifactorial syndrome mainly related to overheating, prolonged apnea, gastroesophageal reflux or inadequate bedding system and posture. In addition, SIDS is ten times more frequent within preterm newborns, around 385 000 babies per year are born preterm in Europe.\n\nBabyCareSleep project aims to develop a novel non-invasive intelligent monitoring system to prevent unexpected deaths in previously healthy infants and to detect risky situations in an early stage. Integrated in the cot through biosensing textiles, matrices of sensors will detect the most relevant biological parameters that will enable the detection of potential risky situation and performing preventive actions. The preventive system will stimulate sufficiently the baby\u2019s brain (generate a sleep arousal) avoiding infant's hypoxia and resuming breathing activity and will be so gentle to not awake the baby from sleep.\n\nAs a result, the SMEs will strength their competitive position facing foreign competition, achieving cumulative benefits during the four year of post-project commercialization over \u20ac10 million. In addition, our proposed system will help to avoid dramatic situations in families and at the same time will give confidence to parents by a non-invasive and cot-integrated monitoring and warning system that will improve their quality of life.\n\nBabyCareSleep project will count with all the involved SME through the supply chain (textiles, electronic & communication, mattresses and a paediatrician sleep clinic); with RTDs of biomechanics, smart textiles and intelligent control systems; and with the support of a association for paediatric research.", 240710.0, 1090949.0, 3, 8, "BABYCARESLEEP", "http://babycaresleep.com/", "http://cogent-technology.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/163224.jpg", "fp7_111138_997827361"], [1280620800000, 1388448000000, "A Platform Power Management System and Low Voltage Drive Train for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles", "Cogent Technology Ltd", "The European hybrid, electric and fuel cell vehicle industry represents 1,600 SME manufacturers and suppliers. They commercialise small volumes of low-emission vehicles, including taxis, delivery vans, factory vehicles and domestic cars. However with current technologies their market is limited and their development has been split between low-cost mass market and expensive high-performance vehicles. These vehicles do not meet customer performance demands, at a price point which is competitive with IC engines. Large vehicle manufacturers overcome this gap and reduce their development costs by platform sharing component technologies. However due to the lack of collaboration within our industry, this platform technology is not available. This proposal addresses this technology gap though the development of an open platform power management system, with customisable performance and efficiency. The platform will be supported by a modular platform drive motor topology, based on a fully scalable axial flux design (100Nm to 1,200Nm cont. torque). The low cost technology will be sufficiently high torque to drive the wheels at a high speed, without requiring an intermediate gearbox. To further drive down cost we will use the housing of the liquid cooled drive motor, as a heat sink for a high current power convertor. This will be achieved by applying a circuit board directly onto the motor housing, using a thermal spraying technology. The project will benefit Europe through increased sales of low-emission vehicles and enable our members to reduce development time by 20% and component cost by 40%. The modular drive motor platform will enable our members to manufacturer desirable vehicles at a competitive price and reduce the total vehicle cost by up to 13%.

Existing sealing technologies are time consuming, ineffective and require a complex paper trail. A reusable and retro-fit, electronic sealing device is therefore required with an ultra-low profile. This new technology will enable the automatic sealing and inspections of galley trolleys, while improving their security by utilising a digital, anti-tamper volumetric sensor. With an initial market value of \u20ac120million retrofitting the technology and an additional \u20ac24milion per year in new trolleys, this market has the potential of significant economic returns. Beyond the catering industry this technology will enable international logistics services and all of the SMEs operating within a secure supply chain to seal their vehicles and reduce their operating costs. Supported by a location dependant (Galileo) tag interrogator and central ICT database, a pair of smart tags will be used to seal and monitor unauthorised access to a trolley, based on a received signal strength indication technology. Upon an authorised activation, the novel security seal will transmit its location and a randomly generated locking number to a central database, using a mobile GPRS communication link in the tag interrogator. By cross-referencing the tag and database values using a standard RFID reader, a security official may ensure that a seal has not been tampered with or replaced. A multi-lingual and bi-colour passive RF display will be installed onto each door of the trolley, for a visual indication of the seal status.

We were fascinated by this technology and its potential, and wanted to learn more about how to use it in our schools. With the encouragement of the Province of Frysl\u00e2n, we developed a Comenius partnership to work with other countries to bring 3D thinking and making into schools.This produced a first attempt at a set of lesson plans using 3D technologies in curriculum subjects for the age range 9-16 and guidance for teachers.Significant interest arose in our Province and across the partnership. Our results were plugging a gap in information and resources available to teachers. We are aware that the lesson plans we produced are only a first step, and we now need extensive trials and testing, producing better lesson plans and guidance for a wider age range.We aim to provide new significant professional resources to help teachers become competent and confident in thinking and making in 3D, using 3D technologies, to recognise the potential for enhancing the curriculum and motivating pupils, and show how to integrate 3D-technology across the curriculum. The main concrete output, 3D Education Lesson Plans Resources and Guidance are intended to support teachers with high quality, tried and tested resources to acquire and improve digital competences across a wide range of education contexts for the 11-18 age range.We believe this will bring a lasting strategic impact for the partner schools and its findings will apply across other fields of education. We want to achieve as wide an impact as possible.
