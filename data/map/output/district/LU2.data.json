This project builds upon previous  projects which comprised 11 visits by 60 VET Lecturers to Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Czech Republic, Finland and Sweden, Lithuania, Cyprus, Portugal and Finland. The lecturers and managers representing 11 ACER colleges were drawn from specialisms including Construction, Motor Vehicle, Electronics, Agriculture, ICT, and Business Studies, Health and Social Care, Hospitality and Catering, Travel and Tourism and Leisure and Sport. The participants also explored to what extent the host country has matched its National Qualification Framework against the EQF and implemented the ECVET system. Resulting from these visits, networks, partnerships and two-way exchanges of staff and learners have already been established. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mobilities project will contribute to both individual continuous professional development (CPD) plans as well as continuing to develop long term strategic partnerships between Est of England Colleges and EU VET providers. Individuals will have the opportunity to widen their knowledge and expertise, including experience of different teaching and learning methodologies, innovations in technology and learning and diverse cultures to help to adapt training courses to meet employers changing skills needs.  All participants will engage in learning the basic language of the host country. Participants are concentrating on the organisation of and preparation for Apprenticeships and Entrepreneurship and Learner guidance and support during the visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will specifically focus on arranging mobilities for 60  East of England college staff- providing them with the opportunity to explore the organisation and management of:\r\n\r\napprenticeship schemes, \r\n\r\ninnovative mathematics teaching, \r\n\r\nuse of skills competitions\r\n\r\nworking with young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the host countries. Within this we will look to learn more about how the host utilise the supportive involvement of employers and business support agencies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the short term we envisage that participating managers and practitioners will learn new ways of delivering vocational training which address the above priorities, as well as sharing their own experiences with the EU VET counterparts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the longer term we envisage that participating colleges will come to see this activity as an essential component of their staff's professional development programme (as has already begun to be the case with some of our colleges). More strategic/longer term  impacts will be as colleges continue and develop the visits and relationships to form longer term strategic partnerships with their European hosts through which further collaborative working/projects can be developed.
