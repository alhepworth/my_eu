The latest UK statistics indicate that the highest workplace fatalities occur within this sector. Previous project partner research also reported related health & safety concerns within this sector & developed a framework for common European VET competence standards. These standards can be adapted & developed further for use within the WAH occupations. At the same time this project aims to facilitate best practice & high quality instruction amongst VET providers & skills trainers of WAH courses across Europe & beyond, exchanging knowledge, innovations & expertise in the process.\r\n\r\nProject Objectives:\r\nThe ultimate project goal is to \u2018raise safety standards\u2019 & \u2018reduce accidents & fatalities\u2019 of workers at height within agriculture & the environment. The 7 key project objectives to successfully achieve this goal are as follows:\r\n1. Organise & run trainer technical standard setting events \r\n2. Organise & run trainer technical evaluation and verification events \r\n3. Produce trainer Codes of Practice, training guides etc for WAH \r\n4. Produce a project web page/social media links & blogs \r\n5. Develop a high quality VET provider & trainer e-knowledge library  \r\n6. Develop a Data Warehouse incorporating web-based analysis tools i.e. statistical analysis of fatalities/accidents etc\r\n7. Develop 3 new European occupational standards & related competence certification in the safe use of chainsaws & other equipment for WAH within agriculture & the environment\r\n\r\nProject Participants:\r\nThe project consists of a very experienced & capable partnership of 12 organisations tasked to ensure its success. Their make-up consists of VET & project management specialists, private & public bodies, non-profit organisations, e-learning, WAH & adult education specialists & government institutions in the education & agriculture sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Activities:\r\nOver the project lifecycle the partnership will undertake numerous tasks in pursuit of the ultimate VET-Safety goal. These include for example:\r\n\u2022 VET-Industry consultations\r\n\u2022 Meeting presentations\r\n\u2022 WAH training techniques analysis\r\n\u2022 WAH competency developments\r\n\u2022 WAH incident evaluations\r\n\u2022 Project dissemination on many levels across numerous sectors\r\n\u2022 International certification events\r\n\u2022 Training publications & guidance materials etc\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Methodology:\r\nThe project will be undertaken in 4 stages within its lifecycle as follows.\r\n\r\nStage 1: (Pre-cycle)\r\nUndertake pre-project planning & preparation meetings\r\nDevelop an effective management plan, project organisational structure & dissemination plan\r\nSchedule the objectives into an action plan of individual tasks & work packages\r\nResource & run trainer standard setting events in partner countries & develop VET training standards\r\nMonitor & evaluate feedback & disseminate information gathered till end of project\r\nPromote project information through the web, social media links etc till end of project\r\n\r\nStage 2: (Mid-cycle)\r\nResource & run trainer evaluation and verification events in partner countries & develop VET assessment standards\r\nPilot test new WAH competency certifications in partner countries\r\nUndertake post-project sustainability planning & preparation meetings\r\nDevelop VET trainer QA materials & e-tools & data warehouse\r\nProduce a project interim report & evaluate findings\r\n\r\nStage 3: (End-cycle)\r\nLive test new WAH competency certifications in partner countries\r\nCompletion of VET trainer QA materials & e-tools & data warehouse\r\nDevelop a project \u2018Exit Strategy\u2019\r\nProject End & final report & evaluation of the findings\r\n\r\nStage 4: (Post-cycle)\r\nAnalysis of project feedback\r\nContinued development, dissemination & enhancement of project products & goals\r\n\r\nProject Impact:\r\nThe project will reach its objectives via enhancement of current training products available but more importantly through completely NEW partnership innovations focused on VET WAH safety. These are:\r\n1. Web based VET knowledge library: e-LIBRARY \r\n2. International VET Data Warehouse & associated incident analysis & reporting tools \r\n3. Safe use of ladders & MEWPS & emergency rescue techniques VET qualification \r\n4. Aerial use & safety of a chainsaw VET qualification \r\n5. Safe use of winches in manual & mechanised lifting & pulling operations VET qualification \r\nThe web based e-tools will enhance training experience, course delivery methods & benefiting both the trainer & trainee. These tools associated with 3 new European qualifications accredited & delivered to high quality standards will have an immediate impact in helping to reduce accidents & fatalities. Longer-term development of these across Europe will lead to further reductions in accidents & fatalities & increased worker safety on a wider scale supported by the unique predictive analysis capability of the VET Data Warehouse", "http://www.a1-arborists.com", "A1 Arborists LTD/Limited", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA202-001870_coordinator"], [2018, "European Utility Arborist", "A1 Arborists LTD/Limited", 281976.0, 7, 7, "Project Background:\r\nThe EU-ARB project has been designed to the meet the needs of arborists involved within high risk UA activities particularly within energy sectors of industry responsible for vegetation/tree management. Recent European & UK statistics indicate a rising workplace fatality rate associated with hazardous work undertaken by arborists. Previous project partner research also reported related health & safety concerns within this sector & developed a framework for common European VET competence standards. These standards can be adapted & developed further for use within the Utility Arboriculture (UA) occupations. At the same time this project aims to facilitate best practice & high quality instruction amongst VET providers & skills trainers of UA courses across Europe & beyond, exchanging knowledge, training innovations & expertise in the process leading to safer trained arborists.\r\n\r\nKey Needs:\r\nThe ultimate project goal & key needs are as follows:\r\n1. Improve & enhance utility arborists skills, safety & supervision in the workplace through the development of a simplified qualification structure on 3 very practical & industry relevant levels\r\n2. Reduce utility arborist fatality & incident rates particularly where adjacent to energised power lines in the workplace\r\n3. Reduce associated economic & personal costs related to UA accidents \r\n \r\nKey Objectives:\r\nAchieving the key needs requires the following objectives to be met:\r\n1. Develop innovative European occupational standards in UA \r\n2. Improve transparency and recognition of UA skills via innovative European qualifications accredited by ABA International\r\n3.
