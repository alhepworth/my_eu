A group of artists led this initiative where they explored the impact of photo-interactive activity with 26 people in a drug and alcohol treatment service formally known as SERT (Italian Public Health Service dealing with substance misuse).Participants attended a one-year informal training course during which they gained an a working knowledge of photography and its potential uses for artistic, vocational & professional purposes. The overall objective of \u201cPalermo, a focused look\u201d (whose scientific monitoring was done by the Department of Pathological Addictions - Research Unit - University of Palermo), was to develop an innovative approach to instigate a process of change in beneficiaries through empowerment.Project evaluation outcomes were encouraging and demonstrated a significant success rate of 88.5% where participants reported a stronger personal identity, enhanced motivation, greater awareness of emotions & how to better express themselves, increased levels of self-esteem and confidence. In addition, participation in the project also led to an increase in vocational skills related social reintegration and future educational & employment opportunities and enhanced skills in photography. Using the research and work previously done by ASP-Palermo on the project: Palermo - uno sguardo a fuoco as a starting point, ART and SOCIAL CHANGE proposes to work towards a culture shift in health organisations working within the substance misuse and recovery sector. ART and SOCIAL CHANGE involves the implementation of several innovations which differ markedly from the previous approach used by ASP-Palermo. This proposal involves a Pan-European dimension with experts on the topic coming from 5 EU countries who will share their experiences and provide their own, invaluable contributions to deliver the project outputs.  ART and SOCIAL CHANGE is a cross field project with the main focus being on health care staff training, but also linking this with the innovative use of art and media as healing tool. The project hopes to expand the use of more varied forms of art and media (from just the original use of photography), to induce social-change.  An important aim of the project will be to develop suitable and relevant CPD and training materials based on international research and empirical testing. This will be done using an interdisciplinary and collaborative team. This will be composed of three different elements from the partner countries i.e. artists, health professionals and people in long-term recovery working together. It will also involve the unique use of peer-to peer learning and training.  This will be done through the following and innovative method: - The initial phase will be to establish an interdisciplinary collaborative team (artists, health professionals and people in long-term recovery). The teams will be selected from the piloting countries: LT, UK, FR and IT. These piloting countries will be referred to as the Peer Learning Group (PLG);- The PLG will then undertake visits to each piloting country to undertake learning, teaching and training activities (LTT) and observe current ideas and practice. Each partner involved in the piloting will also prepare a national report of the state of the art. This will be further collated by the Lithuanian partner (VIKO) to produce an international comparison report. - On the basis of the research and the results of the LLT, the (DE) VET provider will coordinate all the partner countries with the purpose of devising and delivering a CPD training framework and training materials; - The CPD framework and training materials will be piloted, tested and cascaded in three phases. The first phase will be undertaken directly by the piloting countries IT, FR, LT and the UK, who will test and evaluate the framework and training materials amongst themselves. In the second phase, using the results of the evaluation and any subsequent amendments, the framework and training materials will be tested with actual service users in each pilot country; this will also be further evaluated. The third phase will then involve peer-to-peer training, where health workers will train co-health workers using the final version of the framework and training materials.- Alongside this, partners will have to prepare documentary evidence of the training and the process using video format. This will be coordinated by La Maison de l\u2019image (FR).- A set of written guidelines for decision makers). These guidelines will be developed to inform decision makers with regards to the main findings of our transnational cooperation in order to integrate the \u201cART and SOCIAL CHANGE\u201d training in the CPD programmes. This will be coordinated by Mano-guru (LT).", "http://portraitsofrecovery.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-LT01-KA202-023234_6"]]}}, "6AA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Mobility Coach ll", "The Oldham College", 166728.0, 8, 10, "\u201cMobiCoach II\u201c continually aims at enhancing the quality and quantity of mobility of our learners in Europe.  We would like to improve the international vocational competence of both \u2013 learners (IVT and dual system) and teachers. Due to the installation of so-called \u201cEuropean Classes\u201d in our IT and Design departments we itensify the integration of work placements abroad within the curricula of these IVT full time training courses. Therefore we offer unique educational opportunities at our vocational college und strengthen our profil in St\u00e4dteRegion Aachen.\r\n\r\nThe project is subdivided in three phases: during phase one we intensify the contact to our partner organisations. Ideally we can carry on organizing two responsible teachers for each partner organization who travel into the countries to develop the contacts. We plan a length of four days for these mobilities. Participating teachers heighten their knowledge about Initial Vocational Training, training courses, qualifications and curricular. In cooperation with their partners abroad they develop the Memorandum of understanding which serves as a basis for learning agreements. This process includes an ongoing comparison to our curricular with their learning objectives and competences. Thus we enhance the quality of work and learning phases and develop strong cooperating partnerships. The involved staffs increase the international vocational competence (language, intercultural competence) as well as organisational skills and qualify therefore as \u201cMobiCoaches\u201d. \r\n\r\nPhase two concentrates on organising and carrying out the placements. \r\nThe target groups are (in % the percentage of all applied mobilities): \r\n\r\n1. Apprentices/ learners in a company abroad with a duration of 14+2 = 16 days (16/ 10.4%)\r\n2. Apprentices/ learners in a company abroad with a duration of 21+2 =23 days (16/ 10.4 %)\r\n3. Apprentices/ learners in a company abroad with a duration of 30+2 = 32 days (4/ 2.6%)\r\n\r\n4. Apprentices/ learners in a school abroad with a duration of 21+2 =23 days (74/ 48%)\r\n5. Apprentices/ learners in a school abroad with a duration of 14+2 =16 days (4/ 2.6%)\r\n\r\n6. Teacher mobilities with a duration of 2+2=4 days (34/ 22%)\r\n7. Teacher mobilities with a duration of 6+2=8 days (2/ 1.3%)\r\n8. Teacher mobilities with a duration of 12+2=14 Tage (4/ 2.6%)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the IVT \"european classes\" in ICT and Graphic Design the mobilities will take place in their second year.  Having had good experiences we are planning three weeks. \u201cMobiCoaches\u201d support learners  to organize the working / learning period abroad beforehand and to stimulate learning agreements on the basis of the Memorandum of  understanding.  Again they accompany learners and take part at subject-matter specific classes of the partner institution (Job Shadowing) and/or visit the companies of their learners. They get to know teaching methods and participate actively in the didactic process. Learning agreements can be supervised and learners are supported to start their work / learning experience to enhance their international vocational compentence.\r\n\r\nPhase three includes comprehensive presentations (testimonials, videos) of the placement experiences and publishing the results. We present to staffs, learners and, very important, to the chambers of commerce and craft as the representatives of employers. This has been an excellent method to advertise our project and to enhance its acceptance. Subsequently we will increase the number of learners and trainees (dual system) participating in \u201cMobiCoach\u201d.  Moreover we will evaluate the placement experiences and assess the fulfilment of learning agreements to find out the need for development. The results of the evaluation serve as a basis for developing the Memorandum of understanding and future learning agreements.", "http://www.oldham.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003719_8"]]}}, "7QF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Words in to Action", "Depaul UK - Oldham Pathway", 51376.0, 6, 13, "Our 'Words into Action' Project involves bringing together EVS participants and young people at Depaul homeless accommodation services where they can learn and develop from mutually beneficial interactions and relationships.
