FARE are a community organisation based in Glasgow Scotland providing supports for the families and young people living in Glasgows East End. For this programme and to build a working relationship between the two organisations, the youth workers decided to apply to host an Erasmus+ exchange here in Ireland.This was an opportunity to allow young people with fewer opportunities to participate in inter cultural non formal learning education. The aim of this programme is to bring 18 young people, aged 15-16 years together to grow, learn, enable, participate and become active in an international youth exchange supported by youth workers with a focus on employability. This will be achieved through workshops on the 'A Life of Choices' Erasmus+ exchange, preparation prior to the exchange and further outcomes achieved following the exchange through publicising and circulating information about the exchange.\r\n\r\nFARE and For\u00f3ige Tallaght both operate in disadvantaged neighbourhoods where there are large numbers of early school leavers and youth unemployment. Much of the literature identifies lack of school attainment and attachment as indicators of risk for offending behaviour. Early school leavers young people that fall into the NEET group (Not in Education, Employment or Training)  are at a much greater risk of  becoming involved in crime or anti-social behaviour than those who complete their schooling. Employment and having goals are also major protective factors for a young person, so enhancing these could reduce the likelihood of a young person becoming involved with criminal and /or anti-social behaviour. While much research emphasises changes that can be made within the school environment to support a wider range of pupils, there is also a role  for involvement in community activities which have been shown to help foster a sense of belonging. The National Quality Standards Framework for youth work recognises the importance of intercultural non formal learning.\r\n\r\nThis programme is a holistic programme, which facilitates young people to identify factors which influence their choices and impact their employability. It will create the space to challenge attitudes in relation to employment and enhances young people skill sets to assist them in making positive choices now and in the future. The programme will enable the young people to take charge of their development in order to enhance the quality of their lives. The exchange will last 7 days will take place in Tallaght Dublin. The young people will take part in a variety of workshops and activities deepening their knowledge and challenging their personal values about employment, employability and education. The young people will present their learning to their peers through the youth caf\u00e9s/clubs they attend in scotland and Ireland and use social media to highlight the exchange and the impact it has had on them and their personal choices. All the young people will receive recognition when they are presented with their Youthpass certificates  at the end of their programme.", "http://www.fare-scotland.org", null, "erasmus_2017-3-IE01-KA105-038547_1"]]}}}}
