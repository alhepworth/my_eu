They need to be encouraged and boosted when they arrive in our school. In fact, most of them have had difficulties in their secondary schools, and few of them have chosen their vocational training.  Being admitted  to the European Class allows them to get more self-confident, which helps them to start studying again. The mobility is an aim which attracts most of them so they usually work harder. In the future this will open them to new European culture, give them greater opportunities and a better access to jobs  thanks to a higher level of education in fields which are less accessible without this experience abroad (ie : international trade, foreign languages). And they also acquire skills which help them get further in their own field. Finally, our project aims at developing the country's economy, providing students fitted to the needs of the work market at a local, regional and national scale in the field of international trade and business.  Therefore, we would like  to organize this project over one year for 16 students preparing a BTEC level 3 in Sales Management (8 in March-April 2017 and 8 in 2018). Their stay in London will last 28 days; they will be placed in  the Greater London area, and will complete a 4-week work placement; there will  be 2 days for travelling and 4 days for getting used to their new environment: one day will be spent doing a cultural discovery of London, and the other sharing activities with students and teachers from our London partner school \u201cNewVIc\u201d (discovery of British system of education, of a huge sixth form college, sharing business and French courses, sport or art challenges). As our students won't get access to the OLS Platform,we will try to provide them  a 8 hour linguistic course before their work placement. During their trip, our students will be hosted in families and will do their internship in charities, event agencies/specialized stores so that they can communicate in a professional way with different types of people (customers, employees, young or less young volunteers, handicapped people)To complete this project, we will need to involve a service provider, which will help us to find host families, work placements and assist us with the mobility monitoring. Two teachers from the European section will accompany the students to London and will stay with them for 4 days, which is necessary for the students\u2019 adaptation to their new environment and to ensure they start in training in good conditions. The two teachers will be back at the end of the students\u2019 stay to assess them in their work placements and for their travel back to France. During the students\u2019 stay in London, they will constantly keep in touch with  the students and the service provider. Having a 4-year partnership with this organisation, we will go on working with them as long as we are satisfied with the services provided. This partner is of main interest for us as it is located in Central London. Furthermore, London obviously provides fabulous cultural facilities and human opportunities for our students and it also enables us to maintain exchanges with \u201cNewVIc \u201c.Before leaving for London, our students will attend an additional specific two-hour-a-week course in English and another two-hour course in Sales Management in English. These courses will be given for 2 years before going to London. During the last year - the year of the BTEC exam -  we will organize a Europass ceremony and a London pictures challenge with three rewards. During the exam year, the additional courses will be used to consolidate the knowledge and skills developped by our students during their mobility. We will also intensively prepare them to take their specific European exam. To manage the Project, we refer to our seven -year experience in European Mobility, and try to constantly bring  improvements. The European Agency, the CRE (European Resources Center for Professional Mobilities) can advise us. We also use Life Project management tools boards , plannings (ie: annexes) & organise brainstorming committees. Finally, this project gives our students the opportunity to complete  attractive studies,  get  more fulfilling jobs in France or abroad. And one of the most significant impacts is that these students, are fewer to drop out of school before taking their exams, unlike the other students. They get better exam results and have access to a higher educational level (i.e.:  annex of our class results).

P\u00f4le Emploi International and Regional Council of Pays de la Loire support this project. The human and material resources of the Loire-Atlantique GRETA will be mobilized in order to best prepare and follow these mobilities. P\u00f4le Emploi International will contribute to the preparation, and will provide mentoring of student job seekers at the end of their training, to enhance mobility in a Europass CV, and thus improve their employability. The Regional Council of Pays de la Loire is associated with this project, as training for job seekers assigned to it. Educational training, cultural and linguistic will be provided by the instructor in English GRETA in addition to the online preparation. The main objective of this project is well FIDEME facilitate employability and professional integration of job seekers, assuming that the implementation of a mobility increases adaptability, and can attract the interest of employers.Expected outcomes: employability, professional, cultural discovery, improving English language skills, adapt to another professional context, and participation in a project with a European dimension in order to strengthen the Euro-citizenship. The first years of project implementation (84 trainees between 2011 and 2015) have enabled us to better understand the overall operation of this innovative device for GRETA, and identify areas for improvement: better selection of businesses by intermediate organizations, better monitoring on-site involvement of GRETA trainers and assistants. Corrective actions related to our continuous improvement process (ISO 9001), have been carried out.The acronym FIDEME (\"Facilitate Integration of the Job Seekers by the European Mobility\") is again used because it symbolizes and now clearly identifies this project. Developments from the beginning, have obviously been implemented, including through the contribution of participants to return to their mobility, and 2016-2018 proposes developments, including opening mobilities in several training courses GRETA.
