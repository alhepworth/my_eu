It is important for the main social actors, in charge of young people\u2019s professional training, to create new educational paths more targeted and flexible towards modern needs, adaptable to the definition of new matching mechanisms with the labour market. \r\n\r\nT.R.E.N.D. -Targeting Regognition of compEtences and qualificatioNs for inDustry 4.0,was mold out of this context. Its main aim is to reduce the progressive skills mismatch registered within the local sector of the industry 4.0. Beginning from a mobility action , the project aims at achieving important specific objectives, such as: \r\n1. promoting a better matching between education and professional training;\r\n2. encouraging local youth employability and spreading the right competencies required from the industry 4.0;\r\n3. experimenting a learning methodology based on work (WBL);\r\n4. supporting knowledge acquisition along with technical-professional competencies and transversal skills in the reference sector; \r\n5. Promoting transparency and equal recognition of all the competencies acquired through the application of ECVET methodologies and tools.\r\n\r\nT.R.E.N.D. is open to 100 recent graduates (graduated in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018) from Campania region. The ideal candidates would come from Vocational Institutes where they studied informatics, telecommunications, mechanics and ,mechatronics, electrics/ electronics and/or other types of high schools which might have held similar training paths.  The project will give them the opportunity to carry out a professional internship of 180 days (6 months) in foreign companies related to the abovementioned economic sectors and in the following countries: United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Malta and Netherlands, which are pioneering countries in the project main sectors, protagonist of the transformation process above described. \r\nIn order to achieve the previously defined purposes, Glocal, in quality of coordinator, built a national Consortium made up of those main social stakeholders that play an important role within the interconnection process between education and productive system: Regione Campania, Ufficio Scolastico Regionale (USR) together with 10 vocational institues, Federmanager, Confindustria campania, trade unions organizations such as CGIL, CISL E UIL, Fondazione Carisal, in cooperation with foreign receiving organizations and host companies operating  in the industry 4.0.  For its duration, T.R.E.N.D. may produce an important impact at many levels: local, regional and national at the same time, due to the connection between public/private bodies from education and professional training and the representatives of the labour market. They would be connected in a profitable exchange of ideas and best practices, in a debate on possible modalities and promotion strategies as regards the theme of youth employability. After their mobility abroad, the project\u2019s participants will be given a new opportunity of internship at some Italian companies, which already showed availability in hosting the candidates that acquired the most specific skills during their experience abroad. \r\nThe entire local Campania territory will benefit from the growth of its human resources\u2019 abilities and skills. These young resources will be open-minded towards a more European perspective, but at the same time they will contribute to the competitiveness of the local productive system and will feed the innovation power that lies within their territory.  During the follow-up, the general evaluation will measure the impact on the participants in terms of their increased job opportunities (considering the number of job proposals that the participants will receive abroad , that are expected to reach the 25%, and the number of internships/job opportunities they will find at their return within the 6 months following the end of the project, which are expected to reach the 35%). At a more European level, the project will keep alive the attention on the debate regarding the certification and recognition of those professional qualifications and competencies acquired in professional contexts from all over Europe, with the purpose of encouraging the application of European standards and the implementation of the ECVET system .", "http://www.allianceautomotivegroup.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005914_8"], [2017, "T.R.A.D.E.- Training Activities for the Development of new Enterprises", "Alliance Automotive Group", 543972.0, 5, 20, "The project Training Activities for the Development of New Enterprises is designed starting from the needs of the area and the problems that young people from Calabria have to face with reference to the inclusion in the labor market.

Waste2Go will develop technologies to improve waste management and increase value (social, economic & environmental). This will be validated as Best Available Technology (BAT) by recognised LCA experts. It will extend beyond the state-of-the-art in enzyme based technologies for fine-tuned biomass processing and combine them with intelligent techniques for MSW fractionation and downstream processing. It will unlock economic value from MSW and reduce its serious environmental impacts. MSW will become a sustainable source of raw materials for the chemical industry, replacing fossil sources.
