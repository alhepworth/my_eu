We could also run into the fact that the skills of the teachers in the use of mobile technology are quite different. \r\nThis year we were able to join an international project about mobile learning. Next to that we realized that learning from each other by sharing knowledge with teachers both nationally and internationally in the area of such a big change is probably a very important one. Together we know more than alone and we can learn a lot from each other. As a school we decided that it is good to continue looking for ways how mobile technology is used. This was picked up by the ICT-er and teacher of the school. Also the staff member of the foundation of the school decided to think about this.

Kabeer (1999) argues that to empower girls and young women the following criteria, which are indivisible, must be met. Girls and young women must have; ownership of resources, the power to participate in decision making processes and also well-being and achievement. \r\nEvidence of research highlights that providing the opportunity for young women to engage with their peers in a single gendered environment on a regular basis enables opportunities for girls and young women to explore topical issues and also creates room for them to build knowledge, learn new skills and build meaningful relationships with professionals, as well as their peer group.\r\n\r\nThe partnership for this ambitious all female youth exchange are from the UK, Italy and Netherlands all working with the lead organisation from Ireland. \r\nThe aim of this long-term Youth Exchange project is to explore the portrayal of women in the media and the impact this has on young women today. \r\nThe young women from Ireland were the first to identify the desire to do a youth exchange and then quickly identified the focus and then partners were searched for. Once partners were confirmed, the young women predominantly from the UK and Ireland were instrumental in shaping the content for the application based on organisational activities in youth councils and young women\u2019s groups locally. This was done through face to face meetings an online consultancy with the young women. This helped to identify a project name, confirm dates, intentions, interest and the type of activities.  \r\n\r\nThe project aims to provide the opportunity to bring 32 young women, Age 15-20. from 4 countries who hold no prejudice towards each other and are in similar social settings with similar issues and concerns.  Leading on from this, it is hoped to explore how women are regarded, not only in society but in the media which is one of the biggest influences in their lives.  There are two youth exchange mobility's planned; one for August 2018 in Italy and the final one in January 2019 with identified 5 phases throughout the whole process;. \r\nPhase 1 - Lights, Camera - National meetings for preparation of first Youth Exchange\r\nPhase 2 - Action - Using the first exchange to share /explore the role of women and cultural differences\r\nPhase 3 - Girls Go Guerilla - Testing identified actions created in the Youth Exchange in their own realities and localities\r\nPhase 4 - Mirror Mirror on the Wall - Second Youth Exchange to review /reflect on the process and sharing the results, impact and outcomes\r\nPhase 5 - WoW (Working on Women) - Disseminating the results, outcomes and benefits of the project to wider stakeholders\r\n\r\nThe whole process is consultative, and the groups from each country will be kept informed weekly / monthly alongside their own work plans.

While some countries do the Youthpass during the exchange, This partnership will wait until they return from the 2nd exchange to re-engage young people about what they learnt on the exchange. We strongly believe that the Youthpass makes young people more confident, with the added advantage of increasing their employment prospects.

Across the MEDA region youth work happens on the frontline of conflict, political uncertainty and issues of migration and the Balkans, much similar to Italy in terms of youth work environment and current state of affairs, are also still dealing with the consequences of war.\r\nWhat is common for all is that there appears to be natural or structured pathway or transition for progressing from being a young person in the youth club to becoming a youth leader, and in most countries there is no recognition tool for young people or newcomers to youth work to develop their leadership skills and youth work practice.

Out of studies, such as The European Youth Forum\u2019s study about the contribution of non-formal education in terms of increased employability, the soft skills that employers most frequently demand include communication skills, organisational/planning skills, decision-making skills, team working skills, confidence/autonomy and numeracy. Five of these six most frequently demanded soft skills that employers require are also being amongst those skills developed to a greater extent in youth organisations, the exception being numeracy. \r\nThese soft skills are seen as a key element for successful job performance. Certain personality traits are also found to be important components of these skills and competencies, contributing to their development.  For example, sense of initiative and pro-activity are traits associated with confidence/autonomy and entrepreneurship. Employers do also have a positive attitude towards young people\u2019s experience in youth organizations. Employers however stress a special emphasis on the way of presenting the skills and competences (what they present, how they present it has more impact than what is written on the paper) acquired during the participation in youth work, which is an area where there is still room for improvement. \r\n\r\nIn youth work, we have the instrument of the youth pass at European level,  a lot of countries have own national recognizing tools for competences, and each young person can use the European CV format (the Europass CV) for presenting the skills and competences towards employers. But only few still know, how to work effectively with it (e.g. what to present if I have already Youthpass from 6 different events). \r\n\r\nWith this project we want to bring youth workers together, to support them in enabling young people to better assess and express their competences for employment purposes.\r\n\r\nYoung workers should be made more aware about the value that employers place on the skills and the competencies developed in the youth work, and youth workers can be trained in how to support the young people they work with, in this topic.

Study Visit will focus on acquiring knowledge about good practices and experiences on the use of Environmental Education and Sustainable Development to involve and include young people providing positive development of territories. Training Course will generate an experience of significant development of skills and competences thanks to the \"Workshop path\" (Environmental education modules, Sustainable life style, Positive promotion of a territory). Local activities will involve young people and will be small events, workshops, outdoor initiatives, providing practical dimension of what participants have learnt in Activities 1 and 2. Seminar will evaluate, elaborate and rationalise all the previous steps (including the local activities) and identify quality elements of the educational, learning and practical path of the project. It will set a methodological and educational platform of shared standards and quality elements on how to use Non Formal methods in Environmental Education to facilitate processes of inclusion, involvement and engagement of young people and especially those coming from fewer conditions. At the end of the project, a booklet will be realised including all the outcomes of the project.\r\nFull involvement and free expression of participants are guaranteed during all phases of the project by using methods of Non-formal Education and especially the ORA (Observe, Rethink, Act) methods.\r\nIn the medium-term perspective the local communities of all partners will benefit from the increasing number of young people engaged in activities which promote sustainable development and environmental education as tools for their inclusion and involvement.", "http://www.urbanorganic.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE04-KA105-016166_1"], [2014, "ORA: Sustainable Communities with Youth Power Switched ON", "Urban Organic (UK) CIC", 40954.0, 9, 9, "The project entitled \"ORA: Sustainable Communities with Youth Power Switched ON\" will last for 10 months.
