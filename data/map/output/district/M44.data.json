We feel it our responsibility to give our children opportunities to see how other cultures live, to give them aspiration and to equip them with life skills from an early age.\r\n\r\nSpeaking French will give our children confidence and an understanding that there is a whole world of life out there waiting for them in the future.\r\n\r\nOur project objectives are to develop the skills of the teachers who will deliver the lessons to the children.\r\n\r\nThere will be 4 direct participants but the impact through cascading the training down to other staff will be for 30 people and 202 children in total.\r\n\r\nThe activities will include auditing staff prior knowledge, school resources and the general opinion of the children and parents. This will give us a baseline to develop from. Staff will then be invited to apply to attend the immersion training course. The successful candidates will attend an eight day course in France, in pairs, six months apart. The first course will improve language skills, the second will consolidate language and allow the school to create links with a French school.\r\n\r\nFollowing the course, teachers will be timetabled to teach in classes together to share their skills and learning. Children will make progress in their French speaking and this will be clear from assessments.\r\n\r\nParents, School Governors, staff and children will be included in the the project through initial consultation, regular ongoing communication through Skype, Blog and email and a final presentation.\r\n\r\nThe work will be sustained long term by staff who will continue to share their knowledge and skills with colleagues and build upon them year on year, with a connection with a French speaking school, there are future possibilities for travel for the children themselves.\r\n\r\nOur vision is that our children grow up to be well rounded, tolerant and accepting people who through a broad and balanced education are equipped with skills for life.", "http://www.stjosephtheworkerrcp.co.uk", "St Joseph the Worker RC Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000094_coordinator"]]}}, "6QE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Immersion d'une classe primaire dans une \u00e9cole \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger", "Fiddlers Lane Community Primary School", 43899.0, 2, 2, "This project is an exceptional opportunity for the pupils and staff of two primary schools: a French rural, alpine school and an English inner city school, to develop cross-curricular skills and confidence in a foreign language using real life situations.\r\nIt is also a unique and unprecedented opportunity to experience an environment completely opposite to their current knowledge of the world.\r\nOver the duration of the project, the pupils will use a variety of tools and activities over numerous exchanges (including IT) and each will experience a full week immersion in the partner primary school. This will enable them to establish long term relationships with foreign children, discover, first hand, the culture of a different country, different life styles and develop their life chance aspirations.\r\nThe project has been designed to be a progressive evolution over two years. There are two main elements to the project : classroom exchanges and immersion visits.\r\n\r\n1. Classrooms exchanges\r\n\r\nDuring the first year, the pupils will establish contact to get to know each other and share common projects ensuring regular exchanges using a range of tools including: paper and post, email, video-conferences and the eTwinning platform for sharing. The shared projects will include mathematic and scientific challenges, sending and receiving parcels with cultural artifacts, film and audio productions shared online and used in classes. The focus will be on learning English/French, both oral and written, to enable pupils to communicate more easily.\r\n\r\nFor the second year the pupils will deepen their foreign language skills through shared cross-curricular projects (sciences, maths, sport) in preparation for the second immersion visit (English pupils in French school). For example: comparing flora and fauna of the different regions.\r\n\r\nAfter the immersion visits, the children will produce films of their visits to consolidate their experiences and demonstrate what they have learned. The diffusion of these films will enable us to highlight the benefits of the project to parents and the local community and to other schools on a departmental level via teacher training from the \u2018Inspection Academique\u2019 and via Headteachers meetings. They will also be shared on social media and the schools' websites.\r\n\r\n2. The immersion Visits:\r\n\r\nDuring the first year, the French children will meet their English correspondents and discover the English education system in an inner city school. They will be immersed in English classes with 3 to 4 pupils per class for a full week. The following year, the English children will meet up with their French correspondents for the second time and discover life in a small alpine French school also for a full school week.\r\n\r\nTransnational workshops will be organised in the classroom over the two visits to enable the children to engage in dialogue and communicate between themselves, thus enriching their language competences. A number of cultural visits will also be organised during the visits to compliment the joint projects studied over the course of the project. For example, visiting a farm in France linked to the shared transnational project \u2018from the farm to the fork\u2019.\r\n\r\nWhen the English pupils visit France they will be hosted in the partner school as well being invited to other rural schools in the vicinity. This will enable the partnership to grow and make the project longer term incorporating future candidate schools for a linguistic immersion trip.\r\n\r\nEvaluation\r\n\r\nThere will be an evaluation of pupils\u2019 foreign language competence before, during and after the project in addition to using the results of academic evaluations.\r\n\r\nThis project is a cooperative and innovative approach to learning foreign languages by providing young children with regular and real life situations to communicate and to be surrounded by foreign language, which we believe is the most effective method of inspiring motivation for and learning a foreign language.\r\nFor the French children, this is a considerable advantage for the professional futures of the pupils who live in a region where the tourist and service sector is rapidly growing. For the English children who are from an area of high deprivation it is an exceptional opportunity to experience life outside their area with the aim of raising their aspirations and improve their life chances.\r\nTo discover another culture and language will also help to overcome preconceptions, fear of difference and the unknown and awaken curiosity. This project will also give us the chance to study the best approaches to learning a modern foreign language.", "http://www.fiddlerslaneprimaryschool.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA219-015250_1"], [2016, "Reducing Early School Leaving and Improving Attendance", "Fiddlers Lane Community Primary School", 13334.0, 2, 2, "The reason we wish to do this project is to improve the attendance of our children. Our attendance is below the national average of 96%, and consistently fluctuates between 94% and 95%. We want to give our children the best start in life, and despite our best efforts, we are not having the impact that we want on attendance or persistent absenteeism. Our objectives are:- for key staff to visit another setting in the EU in order to job shadow, looking at good practice and how it is implemented for impact- for key staff to be trained in different approaches and strategies to removing barriers to attending school- to develop relationships with key staff from other EU settings met during CPD sessions, so that support and common approaches to introducing the new strategies can be discussed and further developed as an on-line group- to improve attendance (and therefore learning) to at least the national average, and reduce the percentage of persistent absentees so that it is in line with national averageThere will be 3 members of staff attending, who are all on the senior leadership team. It will involve the Headteacher, the Inclusion Manager and the special educational needs co-ordinator. The Headteacher has the strategic overview of school improvement and developing school policies. She  has many skills, including communicating to a wide range of audiences and strategic planning. She has been Headteacher for 9 years, and is seconded to work for the Local Authority one day a week to support school improvement.The Inclusion Manager,  is responsible for attendance. She has worked tirelessly to improve attendance at the school, and has excellent research skills, as she has implemented many ideas from other schools at Fiddlers Lane. She works with many stakeholders, including disengaged parents, so has excellent communication skills.The special educational needs co-ordinator is involved in removing any barriers to attendance with many of our children. She works closely with the Headteacher and Inclusion Manager in order to develop practice and procedures in the school. She is also a Specialist Leader of Education, and as such is used to working in other schools.All 3 members of staff would initially visit Collegio Sagrada Familia for job shadowing for a week. We want to get the full view of a week and the impact their strategies have on attendance, including how they use attendance data, how they work with parents, and any particular strategies and the impact of them. We can also see the structure of the week in relation to checking attendance, and how any disengagement is dealt with. We will coincide our visit with one of the 6 parent sessions they hold on emotional intelligence to further develop our knowledge.We have also identified 2 courses we would like to attend, linked to improving attendance at school and reducing early leaving. Both courses have been identified from the school education gateway. The first one is entitled 'Mindfulness: cultivating awareness' and is held in Seville from 13/2/17 - 17/2/17. This is about developing inner calm and therefore helping overcome anxieties, as well as developing trust, something some of our children struggle with due to eg child protection issues, which then impacts negatively on attendance. The second one is entitled 'Coaching in educational contexts to reduce early school leaving' and is held in Madrid (4th - 10th March 2017). This is a course developing the use of EFT, and will be of great benefit for the children we have identified within school as being anxious and therefore non-attenders.  Both courses, along with the information gathered when we were job shadowing, will  inform our attendance policy and practice.We expect the project to impact positively on the attendance of our children, not just next year but in the future, increasing our attendance to at least in line with national average, and reducing the amount of persistent absenteeism. In doing so it will improve the learning and outcomes for our children, and also their life chances. We also expect it to improve parental engagement with the school, in particular around improving attendance. Improved attendance will benefit the children, not just with their learning, but also with life skills, as they will recognise the importance of consistent attendance as they progress through life.", "http://www.fiddlerslaneprimaryschool.co.uk/", "Fiddlers Lane Community Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023096_coordinator"], [2016, "El puzzle de las Emociones", "Fiddlers Lane Community Primary School", 5589.0, 3, 3, "Co-ed school Sagrada Familia is located in the centre of Badajoz, with pupils aged 3-18 in four educational stages, from Pre-School, to Baccalaureate.

Our pupils belong to upper-middle class, that is why we have confirmed a high increase in cases of bullying, anxiety and depression among our students, since their parents hold high expectations regarding their marks. This issue creates a high competitive atmosphere that is reflected in the classes.             To channel our pupil\u00b4s interests, the following projects are taking place at school; Annual Project on Robotics, Programming and Assembling of Legos, TEENEMPRENDE, Project which aims to foster enterpreneurship by creating a youngsters association; EUROESCOLA, Project intending to promote the importance of the European Union.

As for ICTs, our school is endowed with technological resources, and we have good technical knowledge. Thus, our objectives are the following: To generate our own systems to detect, prevent and solve conflicts at school, to train the staff to handle such situations by using techniques and tools related to emotional education, conflict management and mindfulness, to divulge the knowledge adquired by the trained teachers to the rest of the staff and to the other 22 schools belonging to the Catholic Education Institution, through the programme \u201cGood Practice Interchanges\u201d and the school app \u201cEducamos\u201d; to collaborate with the Teachers Continuing Professional Development Centre by teaching courses and workshops, to include those knowledge items adquired after our training into the School Educational Proyect, and the school regulations concerning misbehaviour. Finally the school pursues to join Emotinal Intelligence Extremenian Schools Network, with the help of our School Parents\u00b4 Association and their Parents\u2019 Shool workshops. Achieving all these goals will garantee our commitement for excellence since we will be assessed externally by the above mentioned institutions.
