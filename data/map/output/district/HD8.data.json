The projects aims to support both learners and their accompanying staff to apply their area of vocational learning in an overseas setting.  Our trips and related training help to increase the knowledge and skills of our participants as well as developing a wider awareness of the opportunities available on an international scale.  The program informs the continual development of innovative vocational language learning materials (online and through apps) and enhances the business and educational profiles of the partners we work with.

These students are required to undertake a 2 week work experience as part of their qualification. This project will enable participants to extend and enhance their experience by spending time abroad and therefore gaining valuable cultural knowledge and an appreciation of the value of linguistic skills in their particular field. \r\n\r\nSelected participants typically lack confidence, have low self-esteem, limited life experiences, low career aspirations and poor life skills.  They are drawn from schools/FE colleges in economically deprived deprived areas  e.g. East London, Doncaster, Hull\r\n\r\nBoys in particular, who are a much under represented group in language learning, have shown to be motivated by the practical application of their business language course on our work experience trips and have subsequently gone on to pursue language learning at a much higher level. \r\n\r\nThese include participants from low income families with non-working parents, ethnic minority backgrounds and include a high number drawn from migrant worker families. The project is also open to participants with special needs and disabilities.     \r\n\r\nAll our participants are studying for a vocational course, e.g. BTEC in Sport, Business, Leisure and Tourism and Hospitality Management, have opted for the work experience unit as part of their qualification and are also undertaking a business language course which may have been integrated into their main course or could be a parallel vocational level 2 or 3 course.  \r\n\r\nThe mission of the project is to increase the life chances of our participants and enhance their self belief and career aspirations.  Our aim is to:\r\n\r\n- enable students to carry out their work experience in an international context\r\n- support students in their linguistic, vocational and cultural education \r\n- inspire them to consider wider European career opportunities\r\n- improve students life skills and opportunities\r\n\r\n- to promote the importance of languages in the workplace\r\n- to develop accompanying staff to become more effective vocational language teachers/trainers             \r\n- to provide cross departmental project opportunities and enable interdepartmental staff to collaborate \r\n- to promote the integration of language teaching across a wider curriculum\r\n\r\nOutcomes: Participants will have: \r\n\r\n-increased linguistic and communication skills\r\n-broader understanding of the differences in cross border business cultures\r\n-increased recognition of value of languages in the workplace\r\n-improved motivation and behavior in their learning\r\n-improved ability to make informed career decisions\r\n-higher/wider career aspirations and expectations and an increased likelihood of language study to a higher level\r\n-improved awareness, sensitivity and tolerance to cultural differences\r\n-improved team working capacity and ability to take initiative", "http://www.languagealliance.co.uk", "The Language Alliance Limited", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-013086_coordinator"]]}}}}
