Our contract of objectives focuses on these aims. -preventing early school leaving-Strengthening the educational community-Opening out and developing partnerships.Studying and comparing working methods can help us benefit from them and achieve our goals more effectively. Having consulted our teams on their aspirations concerning their training and their needs, we realized that they massively wanted to improve their language skills, their use of new technologies and upgrade their personal teaching, pedagogical and organizational methods by comparing with other countries. The participants are active members of the group involved in international activities. They know the programmes and have a basic core of values: active and tolerant European awareness based on diversity, firm belief that that formation is essential to give our students, our colleagues and our school authorities a view of a complete educational system with future prospects of improving our own. They will be keen to ensure the dissemination and present our own way of functioning. The fundamental aim of the project is to observe new methods in foreign language teaching, as a main subject and in Content and Language Integrated Learning. Choosing a Spanish school and an English school will enable us to monitor didactical results for first foreign language and second foreign language.The subjects taught in English will be PE and science, and art will be taught in Spanish. At the same time; contacts with other schools will offer the participants further opportunities to create new Erasmus\u00a8+ projects. The opportunity to observe the diversity of the educational systems and be part of them as teachers is an invaluable source of richness in numerous aspects (Managing international teams, operation of a school, assessment of pupils, cultural diversity management policy, language learning, observance of the rules, dialogue with the parents, differentiated education, extracurricular activities, functioning of the associations inside the school, use of new technologies, hierarchy and authorities, local and national guidelines, use of CLIL for foreign languages.)As part of the project, a consortium will be organized between primary, lower and upper secondary schools, and possibly university, positioning itself as a hub of language teaching and European openness.Added to the Comenius / Erasmus + projects carried out for 15 years in our school, a SEPIA (Soutien \u00e0 l'Exp\u00e9rimentation P\u00e9dagogique et \u00e0 l'Innovation dans l'Acad\u00e9mie = Supporting Pedagogical Experimentation and Innovation in the Academy)  project will be implemented  in view of getting the CLIL certification and will be a key element of this excellence.The activities carried out will be based upon observation and participation in the activities both inside and outside school. We will also plan meetings with the administration members, the head teachers, the parents\u2019 associations and other local structures offering a different educative approach.The means of action for this project will be immersion in the host school, so that the participants become full members of the community. The expected outcome is the acquisition of teaching and analyzing methods, the improvement of communication skills (linguistic and social) and the opening up of new channels and possibilities for European cooperation. All this will have an impact on several levels:-individual: improvement of the skills and use of evolutionary pedagogical tools-local: in the host school (through the mobility report) as well as in the sending school because the pupils will benefit from the better educational performance of the participating teachers.-general : in the two countries\u2019 educational communities, because the results of this experience will be profitable to staff currently in post and to future participants.The long-term benefits are linked to the impact: training in foreign language teaching is essential to raise the long-lasting low level of skills in this field in France.This project is an approach to combat the inertia of non-linguistic French teachers not very confident in their skills in foreign languages.It is within this framework that experimenting innovative methods can have positive effects on our environment by improving our skills.", "http://www.castledonington.leics.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA101-013457_1"]]}}, "2SA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1367366400000, 1493510400000, "Single European Secure Air-cargo Space", "Heavyweight Air Express Limited", "EUROSKY will deliver a high impact programme for advanced air-cargo security and facilitation measures to safeguard international supply chains and the security of citizens while fostering international co-operation and a broad stakeholder engagement from all segments of the air-cargo industry.\nThe main outputs will be:\n1.\tThe EUROSKY Blueprints to provide a Europe wide cooperative model for air cargo security and facilitation including Key Performance Indicators.\n\n2.\tA multi-energy based automated detection and alarm resolution solution to provide faster and more accurate detection of dangerous substances with reduced false positive rate.\n\n3.\tThe EUROSKY Ecosystem to provide a technological infrastructure for electronically connecting air-cargo stakeholders together, amplifying their security capabilities through faster communications, shared scans and intelligence, real-time optimisation, pooled resources and synchronised actions.\n\n4.\tProvide Integrated Air-cargo Security Solutions including cargo profiling, screening of the identity and intent of the people who had their hands on the container, and integration of detection technologies in supply chain flows with remote monitoring options\n\n5.\tSix  EUROSKY Demonstrators to be used across several representative operating scenarios characteristic of the air-cargo security sector, covering all aspects of air-cargo security at National and International level and considering access threats, content threats and human error threats, to evaluate outputs and to provide data for impact assessment.\n\nSpecial attention will be given in EUROSKY to building improved understanding of prevailing complexities and vulnerabilities and ensuring long term sustainability of project outputs and market take-up based on a Stakeholder Engagement Strategy emphasising international co-operation both to promote harmonisation in regulations and in supporting further development and implementation of international standards.", 228364.0, 15123293.0, 9, 24, "EUROSKY", null, "http://www.heavy-weight.com", null, "fp7_108456_953841256"]]}}, "2TZ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Ziele und Ma\u00dfnahmen der Integrationspolitik im internationalen Vergleich", "Hydro Systems UK Limited", 31718.0, 7, 17, "The vocational training at the dual vocational college (Duales Berufskolleg) incorporates a job placement of several months. The trainees in the Ortenaukreis, as well as the training companies, the zweiteSchule gemeinn\u00fctzige Gesellschaft (a non-profit organization), and the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Lahr work closely together for the mobility project.

It is indispensible for local companies depending on export to encourage their trainees\u2019 language skills. The results of the mobility activities over the last years have shown that the participants not only improved their language skills but furthermore enriched their intercultural and methodological competences, not to speak of their positive personal development. The involved companies and the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Lahr are committed to an improvement of these competencies. \r\nThe mobility project is going to take place from August until December 2014. Our trainees are going to do their job placements in the UK, France, Ireland, Iceland, the Czech Republic, Spain and Switzerland. The trainees of the Duales Berufskolleg are required to complete a job placement for several months during their training. The training companies completely support this measure since they profit from the knowledge and the skills that the trainees acquire in the partner companies abroad.
