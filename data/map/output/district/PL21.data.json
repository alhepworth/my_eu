Both agents want to offer an answer to increase the employability of their young people as well as to improve the level of English. 60 young people with VET diplomas in different professional fields carry out a 90-day mobility to a company in another country: United Kingdom, Ireland, Czech Republic or Poland. In the company he/she follow a itinerary of learning with the support of the companies and the contact from the consortium. 22 VET educational centers in all provinces of Castilla y Leon are part of the national consortium promoted by Instituto de la Juventud de Castilla y Leon. The beneficiaries are young people between the ages of 18 and 25 who have recently graduated in a VET. Their level of English is between A2 and B1. It is a matter of facilitating this step between their educational pathway and professional life, acquiring with this experience a greater autonomy, security, learning techniques, English, values of tolerance, respect, identity and cultural diversity. The project pursues objectives such as the following:\r\n- To facilitate the young people of Castilla y Leon an experience outside their comfort zone to develop their comepetences, abilities and attitudes related to autonomy.\r\n- To create a learning space in a safe working environment related to the training field in which the participant is entitled. To promote knowledge of methods and work styles in other countries.\r\n- To enhancement the employability of 60 young people in Castilla y Leon, adding to the CV of the young people and the participants a remarkable work experience, as well as the establishment of contacts within the companies in which they practice.\r\n- To guide the graduates in the region in the design of a training and work plan that allows them to meet their expectations according to their competencies.\r\n- To promote the use of the Europass CV and the system of recognition of credits and qualifications not only through studies, also experiences such as certification of Europass mobility.\r\n- To provide a response to people with difficulties in continuing their studies in insertion in the labor market for fewer opportunities (for this application 16 people with this profile have been submitted).\r\n- To offer a learning beyond the contemplated in the classroom, in the line of the educational plans of the formative cycle.\r\n- To increase the attractiveness of the centers of the region as well as their institutions, their recognition in the effort to respond to the demands of young people.\r\n- To improve the level of foreign languages, mainly English, beneficiaries and the national institutions partners of the project.\r\n- To learn more about the European labor market, which is constantly changing.\r\n- To put into practice the flexibility and adaptability of public centers and organizations in their decision-making and implementation. To facilitate collaborative work and remove administrative barriers.\r\n- To strengthen the cooperation between different organizations with the same user profile: the young person recently graduated in VET in Castilla y Leon and thus respond with more quality and use of resources to their needs.\r\n- To improve the image of the educational system and the measures in place in Spain on youth issues.\r\n- To bring institutions closer to young people and vice versa.\r\nThe results of the project focus on the profile of youth and project partners at local, regional and national level, as the improvement of situations that concern all levels related to youth: youth unemployment.

It has been carried out annually since 2014.\r\nThe project arises from the need to respond to the high unemployment rate among young people in Castilla y Le\u00f3n. To this end, the Instituto de la Juventud de Castilla y Leon and 26 vocational education centers combine forces, synergies and work teams in order to increase the linguistic and professional skills of people between 18 and 30 who have just finished their studies of VET in commercial activities, hairdressing, electromechanics and bodywork of vehicles, bakery, pastry and confectionery, administrative management, conduction of sports physical activities in the natural environment, auxiliary nursing care, social health care for people in situations of dependency, cuisine and gastronomy, catering services, wood and furniture, micro-computer systems and networks. A total of 60 participants who practice for 89 days in companies from another country: Italy, Poland, United Kingdom or Ireland. This aims to achieve the following results: an increase in the competences of the participants in linguistic terms and professional techniques, cooperation between the different institutions that care for the benefit of young people such as the Youth Institute of Castilla y Le\u00f3n, belonging to the Regional Ministry of Family and Equality of Opportunities of the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n, and vocational training centers of the region, to increase knowledge of the labor market by these institutions and better respond to the needs of employability of youth.\r\nThis project is developed at European level with the intention of growing by all the partners involved towards new possibilities of learning and employment, as well as the enrichment between educational systems and youth policies within the European Union. The impact of this project lies in:\r\nObtained by the participants of a Europass mobility certificate that accredits the skills acquired during their mobility experience in another country. The different project partners will see their capacity to work with entities of different nature and different countries strengthened. There will be an approach between the shipping partners and the companies that will facilitate a greater knowledge of the labor and educational reality of the participants. This will encourage a reflection on the educational focus of the institutions. The success of the project will influence the decision-making and public opinion of our region, betting on similar mobility programs financed by the own resources of public organisms. The intercultural aspect will influence the local community where the participants have lived, increasing the attractiveness of mobility programs and arousing interest in other cultures. A greater openness to new approaches and possible methodologies that the participant will contribute to the company where he practices. The participants will be more likely to have access to a job within their training sector. The consortium and the partners will launch a new mobility project to respond to the needs of new participants. They will include improvements according to the evaluation of the project that concerns us. Improvement and creation of tools to manage mobility projects by all partners. Participants will be able to apply learning planning tools to their day-to-day and professional future.

One expected consequence of these on new tyres will be the slow decreasing of the interest on retreaded tyres in the market. This will compromise the future activity of SMEs working in the field, and also determine a fatal risk for the smallest enterprises.\nTherefore, it is of vital importance for the retreaded truck tyre sector (400 companies, of which 95% SMEs and 14 SME associations/groupings in Europe who allow 50% of European trucks to drive on retreaded tyres) to find a scientifically sound and cost effective methodology for classification of retreaded truck tyres in order to comply with future environmental performance and safety requirements.\nTo maintain the standard in a long-term prospective, and hopefully even increase the market for retreaded tyres, it is necessary to provide clear statistic and reproducible results on the retreads performances.

We have chosen key intellectual outputs which we believe will allow us to systematically capture the broad scope of the project. We recognise that individuals experience of maths is not just affected by their teacher\u2019s competency, enthusiasm for example, as there are greater complexities to review, such as parental engagement and non-formal educational links.\r\n\r\nThe project allows us to look more broadly than this, as education cannot sit in isolation from the world it operates within. Our focus on influences and demands outside of the school setting will be vital to see how these can be influenced, engaged and understood. Through this, further opportunities and best practice can be identified and potential barriers to pupils and future adults can be removed.

The project aims to engage with business, parents and local communities as this is the real world that we all operate within. Understanding and developing authentic parental engagements is going to be a key part of the project and seeing increased involvement and dialogue with parents is crucial to this. We believe that they have much to share, inform and teach stakeholders about their experiences of maths in their real worlds. We also want to engender in our communities the opportunities for pupils to experience real world maths through parents sharing their experiences and providing opportunities for pupils to have mini apprenticeships, where they get to experience maths being used in the workplace or community.\r\nAims:\r\n\u2022 Develop teachers\u2019 confidence, subject knowledge and skills set \r\n\u2022 Examine (and define) the best ways to deliver mathematical curricular content within the constraints of national agenda/expectations\r\n\u2022 Remove and (or affect) the fixed mindset that many parents, pupils and teachers have over the difficulty of mathematic  \r\n\u2022 Develop, innovate and identify materials and resources for teachers to use and children to select from, to improve pupil achievement, attitudes, participation and experience in mathematics\r\n\u2022 Develop children\u2019s understanding and mastery of mathematics, appreciating the contextual relevance of mathematics in all aspects of life.\r\nObjectives:\r\n\u2022 To explore the best practice within the jurisdictions of the participating countries and partners\r\n\u2022 To use real-life learning (and experiences) to excite, interest and deepen learning for pupils so they explore, use and appreciate the value and purpose of mathematics \r\n\u2022 Developing a holistic, community engagement in deepening children\u2019s contextual understanding of mathematics, in particular its significance to local, regional, national and international economic endeavours\r\n\u2022 To raise aspirations in overcoming anxieties in the use and application of mathematics, the access to future employment through secure and creative application of mathematics to a range of career pathways \r\n\u2022 To maximise digital technology, coding and robotics to equip pupils with a breadth of knowledge that is current, relevant and future proof \r\n\u2022 To equip teachers with the confidence to use a range of formal and non-formal techniques to deliver mathematics with interest and excitement, particularly in the areas that are difficult to deliver \r\n\u2022 Develop children\u2019s appreciation of the contextual significance of mathematics in their lives", "http://www.ermington.devon.sch.uk", "Ermington Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036545_coordinator"], [2015, "Robotics for Primary Schools in the 21st Century", "Ermington Primary School", 190806.0, 5, 10, "21st Century IT Teaching for Primary Schools is a collaborative project involving a range of partners with distinctive expertise in primary and adult education, teaching and learning, robotics and information communication technology (ITC). The overarching theme is the development and dissemination of a common pedagogy based on the rapidly changing developments and requirements for ICT including computer programming and robotics. In response to developing economic and social needs of countries across the EU, elements of computer science have entered primary school programmes of work. These new curricula aim to provide a high quality education in the burgeoning field of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), empowering pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world. Engagement with this new discipline ensures that pupils become digitally literate, i.e. able to use and express themselves and extend their ideas through ICT, to become competent for their future workplaces and as active participants in the digital world. Although in the near future, we can expect the first \u2018digitally native\u2019 teachers, the present situation is that there is a discernible gap in confidence and competence between current teachers and their pupils. This has created a challenge for the professional development of teachers and so the overarching aim of this project is to provide some resolution to issues of curriculum implementation in  the fields of information technology in general and robotics and programming more specifically. The project aims to support current teachers and influence the content of  initial teacher education, whilst at the same time making positive impact upon the developing interests and skills of pupils within the primary age range of 4 -11/12 years. These skills are based upon the \u20184Cs\u2019: Collaboration, Communication, Creativity and Critical thinking.\r\n\r\nWe aim to provide evidence for effective:\r\n\u2022 development of 20th Century teachers\u2019 professional knowledge for preparation and delivery of 21st Century skills in learning and ICT for pupils;\r\n\u2022 coverage of new elements of ICT curricular content in computer programming and robotics; \r\n\u2022 provision of  new subject and pedagogic knowledge to support the use of robotics and programming in the primary age range;\r\n\u2022 enhancement of programmes of study to produce age-relevant resources, schemes of work and skills progression;\r\n\u2022 exploration of  ways of combining and generating creativity with logic;\r\n\u2022 understanding from pupils\u2019 viewpoints of the purpose of learning these new skills;\r\n\u2022 development of both  independence and cooperative learning and teamwork: the 4Cs.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\n1.
