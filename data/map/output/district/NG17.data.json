A hybrid of microbial fuel cells (MFC) and conventional anaerobic digestion (AD), H2AD is based on a patented bioreactor and electrode architecture.  H2AD enables a 10x reduction in the time required to reduce the organic content of waste, and recover the energy via conversion to a hydrogen/methane rich biogas. \nEffluent disposal has been identified by LIE as a key restriction on the productivity and profitability of the EU agri-food and drink processing industry (a-FDPI), which is the largest EU manufacturing industry but includes 271,000 micro and small enterprises (\u00b5SE). No viable micro-scale technology currently exists for disposal of effluents from \u00b5SE, or is able to recover energy from these waste volumes. However, currently at TRL6/7 through extensive testing on cattle slurry, H2AD can also directly address the challenge of waste management in the a-FDPI, recovering some of the 288TWh of potential energy lost in effluent from the EU a-FDPI annually.\nThe overall aim of the Phase 2 project is to undertake the experimental development and field trials required to confirm predicted H2AD performance/payback for new feedstocks, derived from the a-FDPI. LIE seek to prove commercial viability for efficient removal of organic content from key process waste streams; slurry; and post-AD liquors, with biogas utilisation strategies for optimum payback. The project seeks to develop sensing for automated/remote control of system operation and optimised biogas yields through process performance. \nStrong collaboration with EU industrial and academic bodies directly open opportunities for the placement of 600 units in the a-FDPI, as well as a further 14,000 applications in primary agriculture and waste management, in line with LIE\u2019s commercial strategy for H2AD to address the \u20ac34 billion global market for waste-to-energy equipment.", 1769440.0, 2527772.0, 1, 1, "H2AD-aFDPI", null, null, null, "h2020_199494_930193529"]]}}, "7AB": {"nhs": {"data": [["RK5", "Ashfield Community Hospital", "nhs_RK5FK"]]}}, "7FH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Aprender idiomas para construir Europa", "Kingsway Primary School", 36410.0, 3, 3, "This Project has three essential goals:\r\n- To improve language learning process.\r\n- To provide educational school projects a European and multilingual dimension.\r\n- To share experiences in order to promote the environment knowledge and caring.\r\n\r\nThis project presents general goals to respond to some needs:\r\n- To encourage new educational processes at schools and, specially, in learning language processes. \r\n- To promote a European awareness in our children.\r\n- To give children a practical point of view about the usefulness of knowing different languages.\r\n- To promote experiences in environment caring and healthy lifestyles.\r\n\r\nThis project goes to all the students from all the schools which participate in this project, in different levels:\r\n- All the students, from 3 years old, will participate in all the activities developed in both languages: Spanish-English.\r\n- The activities in which the French language will be used goes to 10 years-old children. This is the level in which we include the second foreign language.\r\n- Specific mobility activities go to 10 years-old children.\r\n- In relation to the teaching staff, there will be a group of teachers involved in the project in each school. However, there will be some activities along the project process which will need other teachers participation (taking into account the levels which are involved).\r\n\r\nThe project includes some activities, some of them are the following:\r\n- To elaborate multilingual classroom programming included in school curricula.\r\n- eTwinning project.\r\n- To create a web space which allows uploading all the activities that the teacher and the students are doing.\r\n- To elaborate multimedia materials about interesting natural spaces near school participants.\r\n- To promote exchange among students who participate in the project.\r\n- Shared activities about the project.\r\n\r\nThe results should be in relation to the objectives we have proposed:\r\n- A meaningful improvement of teaching-learning process in languages at the participant schools.\r\n- Elements which provide a European and multilingual dimension will be included in the educational projects.\r\n- The quantity and quality of activities developed at schools will encourage environmental knowledge and its caring.\r\n- Children will know more about their environment they live and the other participant schools, as well as meaningful natural spaces.\r\n- Children will learn about the culture of other countries and the children lifestyles\r\n- The students participating in the project will acquire more and better knowledge of the culture of other countries and customs of children with similar ages.\r\n- Students will be able to identify positive and negative actions related to health and the environment.\r\n- Throughout the project, students will practice with the English, French and Spanish languages becoming instruments of daily work.\r\n- Students will participate in real communication situations in a different mother tongue; and communicate with native speakers of other languages.\r\n- Throughout the project we will make use of ICT in the daily dynamics of the classroom, making them common tools of daily work.\r\n- Teachers will prepare schedules and open and multilingual educational materials that can be used at any of the centers within individual curriculum for each school system.\r\n- Teachers will encourage collaborative learning dynamics, both within schools and between students of different institutions participating in the project.\r\n- Students will improve their communication skills in other languages.\r\n\r\nMain expected benefits can be summarized as:\r\n- Improvement of teaching and learning of foreign languages in schools.\r\n- For participating students, the project will add high-quality elements in the process of learning foreign languages, thus improving their communication skills and their level of motivation.\r\n- For participating teachers, the project will mean an improvement in their level of competence, since it will have the opportunity to collect materials and share experiences with colleagues from other countries.\r\n- For both centers and for students and their families, the project will provide a new approach, promoting awareness of belonging to Europe.\r\n- Similarly, all participants in the project will greatly increase their knowledge of the culture and geography of the other participating countries, increasing to the same extent appreciation for other cultures.", "http://www.kingswayprimary.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA201-003577_2"]]}}}}
