The disease is characterized by a developmental course including blindness, epilepsy, speech problems, cognitive regression/dementia, motor coordination problems and emotional reactions including anxiety and depression. There are 33 individuals with JNCL in Norway , the incidence level in other European countries is approximately at the same level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive medical and biological research has been going on for the last decades in order to understand the nature of the disease. There is no medical cure yet and the disease leads to premature death, often 20 \u2013 30 years of age. There is a substantial need for alternative initiatives and actions within education and other non-medical services to meet the challenges of the disease in best possible way.\r\n\r\nThere are very few organisations in Europe responsible for non-medical service provision for individuals with JNCL diagnosis because of the low incidence. Non-medical knowledge of the target group\u2019s needs and best practice is scattered and hidden for others, and written documentation hardly exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTarget groups:\r\n\r\n1. Children and young people with JNCL diagnosis and their families\r\n\r\n2. Children and young people with other dementia diseases and their families (parts of the project may be relevant for these groups)\r\n\r\n3. Professionals within non-medical service provision\r\n\r\n4. Relevant higher education institutions \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n1. Compose a non-medical textbook of JNCL that focuses on the possibilities and importance of formal, non-formal and informal learning in a lifelong perspective and quality of life issues. To be used as a basic foundation of knowledge and improved evidence-based non-medical services for the target groups\r\n\r\n2. Develop educational tools based on the textbook to optimise learning conditions and make educational planning/implementation more effective and targeted.\r\n\r\n3.

Since then the project idea has developed and the group became bigger because it's necessary to connect health care and education professionals together to address this area of need. Therefore the group behind this project comes from a cross sector of professionals that are all connected to the vision field in some way. \r\nThe objectives of this project are to produce training and teaching materials for teachers, a scanning tool and guidelines for health care and educational professionals. The project group has seen that this kind of training, tools and guidelines are lacking in the European environment of vision. \r\n\r\nThe number of project partners are seven and the profile of them are various. \r\nThe National Institute for the Blind is experienced in participating in projects nationally and internationally and will be responsible for leading the project. Positive Eye is a training company that will be responsible for developing the seminars (where we train the teacher advisor)  it is to be held for professionals across Europe and the partnership organizations. The Royal Blind School - Edinburgh .  will be used as a pilot school to try out the resources. This allows the products developed by the partnership to be tried and tested with the teachers and the students with cerebral visual impairment. SPSM - the National Agency for Special Needs Education and Schools is a Research Centre for children with vision loss due to brain damage. SPSM conducts special needs vision assessments and educational advice. They will be responsible for gathering information for the project and pilot the screening and guidelines and other resources that will be put forward. The University of LEUVEN is to be involved in the project and will be represented by Prof Dr Els Ortibus. Dr. Els Ortibus who is a leading specialist in CVI within Europe and will be responsible for creating a screening tool for cerebral visual impairment. ChildVision, Dublin, is Ireland\u2019s National Education Centre for Blind and Visually Impaired children and young people. ChildVision will fulfil the internal moderation function, ensuring through specific methodological means that the ongoing evaluation ensures the project remains on target, in terms of generating an end result with the potential to improve teaching strategies and benefit learners. The Icelandic Diagnostic Center is known for their extensive knowledge of children with disabilities. A paediatrician from the centre who is one of the most experienced doctors in the field in Iceland at working with children with visual impairment  will have on their responsible for developing guidelines for health and educational professionals in partnership with University of Leuven. \r\n\r\nThe activities that are going to be supported by this project is intellectual output of knowledge of cerebral vision impairment. This is done by making a educational resources, training materials and seminar for teachers. \r\n\r\nThe methodology used in carrying out the project will be a typical project management methodology. 1. Initiation, 2.  planning and design, 3. execution, 4. monitoring and control and 5. closing. We have already begun in the first steps of the project where we have already initiated the idea and started to plan it with budget control, scope and responsibilities. It's not until we have our first meeting where the execution of the project begins where we will over a three year period work on the resource material, web site, develop the screening and the guidelines, host a multiplier event and workshops in our own countries. \r\n\r\nWe envisage that through our project there will be awareness raising in Europe that we can help to fulfill a need for special training for teachers working with students with cerebral visual impairment and that we can help to fulfill that need with our training material, screening and guidelines. Through our work we hope health care and educational professionals will be more interested and have increased knowledge in cerebral visual impairment and more children will be identified and receive the help they need for their disability. It is well known that children that don't recognize their fellow students because of things like face blindness experience barriers.\r\n\r\nThe potential longer term benefits of the project is that the knowledge of CVI will be included in the training of teachers that work with students with CVI and they will no longer be thought to not have the ability to read or write, their right for literacy will be the same as fellow students in the school system.", "http://www.royalblindschool.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IS01-KA201-013160_6"]]}}, "4LR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "New Horizons", "Boroughmuir High School", 5230.0, 2, 2, "New Horizons is seen as a pilot project to establish an European / International dimension to the professional develop at Wasaskolan.\r\nProfessional development plays an important role at Wasaskolan, Tingsryd, a small and the only secondary school in Tingsryd kommun.

Technological advances to reduce packaging costs are therefore of pivotal importance to maintain the competitive edge of assembly companies.

We strive to support learners to reach their full potential in everything that they do.  Our staff have varied knowledge, skills and confidence in French from complete beginner to University level.  Until this year French was taught solely to primary 6 and 7 by a specialist teacher.  During this academic year we have embraced the 1+2 approach with a focus on embedding modern languages and including opportunities for cultural and topic related learning where possible.  Staff are enthusiastic and keen to increase their experience to improve the quality of learning opportunities for the children resulting in many of them dedicating their professional development hours towards improving their French.  Despite this positive start all staff feel their confidence in teaching French can be increased and so we are keen to pursue every opportunity to support this and language learning in France where we can interact with native speakers would be a fantastic opportunity.  By attending a LFEE course in France our staff would become more confident to develop and deliver high quality learning experiences for our children which would help us meet our School Quality Improvement Plan target.  An increase in confidence would allow them to become champions for modern languages; supporting colleagues and pupil support assistants and spreading enthusiasm.  By ensuring several staff members attend the training we will increase our ability to support and sustain change.  Sending 8 staff members, including a member of the senior management team, could mean a French champion at each stage plus support in policy making and sharing with the community.  Commitment to professional development would be clearly evidenced.  The LFEE courses introduce attendees to new and motivating resources and demonstrate how to adapt ideas for different ages.  They balance language learning with cultural activities.  There is an opportunity to network with like-minded individuals encouraging sharing and supporting perhaps with moderation in France and on our return to Scotland.  The opportunity to gather cultural resources to encourage comparison between Salignac and Lyon and Edinburgh are huge and naturally encourages global citizenship.  Even to share with our learners that we went to France as part of our job could be enlightening for them!  The expected impact of this training opportunity is that all staff will increase confidence and skill level in French leading to their greater ability to teach French.  In turn this will filter through to the rest of the staff through our French champions.  French and France will be promoted and all teaching staff will be enthused.  Able teaching staff will transfer their positivity to their learners leading to success.  An increase in the quality and quantity of French teaching will lead to an increase in the ability of the learners so we will need to produce and source new resources or new ways of using resources.  This will certainly be supported by attending an LFEE immersion course.  Champions will suggest and model resources and they will also have access to resources created by others, friendships formed during the courses will ensure sharing and supporting outwith our school.  Our whole school approach will lead to including a French element in assemblies.  Parents will be included and encouraged to support our efforts at home.  We will be able to share the impact of our progress locally within our community, with our cluster schools and beyond.  We aim to raise awareness of the importance of fostering a love of languages and Europe within school to all.  We have begun investigating eTwinning as another option in building global connections but require further investigation to select a suitable project.  Increasing modern language learning will assist our young people cognitively and give them the ability to compete in today's world.  In turn this will benefit the UK economically.
