We have high levels of SEN ( 18.2% ) free school meals (62%) and EAL (    46.4% ). We are an increasingly popular school and have received a bulge class to accommodate the growing need for places within the borough. We have high expectations of our pupils and are not complacent.  We are constantly striving to improve what we do.  Our children achieve well in relation to national expectations at Expected levels  at KS2.  However, our school priority remains to increase the numbers of children attaining higher levels, especially disadvantaged pupils.  Many of our children have very low attainment levels on entry and we have a broad range of provision on offer to support those children who are working below age-related expectations. However we would like to match the quality of provision on offer for higher ability pupils to what is already offered to their less able peers.  We are always keen to share best practice and to learn from the practice of others.  To this end to date we have worked collaboratively with a large number of  Southwark schools. We have helped these schools to organise their visits to us, to ensure they meet their objectives and stay within their budgets.  We are committed to sharing best practice with other schools and do this already through providing courses, visits and consultancy.  Having a more European perspective would enable us to better offer this kind of support to other schools. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop a greater awareness of what international schools are doing and for participants to learn from these schools best practice in order to raise the attainment and aspirations of our more able pupils, especially those who are disadvantaged.  Furthermore, as stated in our school improvement plan we wish to develop and promote a more creative and entrepreneurial curriculum. This project will allow us to send 28 teachers from across the school (including school leaders) to four European Countries (Norway, Sweden, Italy and Spain) to observe good practice with a view to implementing more effective strategies and to developing opportunities for the children in our classrooms to connect with children in the classrooms of other European countries. We would  offer the opportunity for the schools we visit to undertake return visits to us.  20 teachers will be split into 4 groups of 5 accompanied by  2 senior leaders with each group visiting one of the four countries.  We already have links with schools in Sweden, Italy and Spain and will seek through   professional relationships with partner schools to organise links in Norway. On returning from each trip the group will share their findings with the leadership team and phase leaders and the information will be evaluated and action plans developed, then shared with the teaching staff, intervention teachers and teaching assistants, in order to drive improvement. At the end of the project we will compare and evaluate the results and draw conclusions that will support us to improve our own practice and that we can share with other schools in our borough and more widely.\r\n\r\nThe course will include:\r\nA visit to the education department in the district visited to learn about national, regional and local education systems.\r\nVisits to a number of local schools to observe practice, talk to practitioners and see the strategies being used on the ground.\r\nVisits to museums, businesses, and cultural attractions that the schools in the area use to support and enhance curricula. \r\nReturn visit to the education department to discuss and evaluate our findings and prepare for the dissemination of this information to staff in our schools and more widely.\r\nThe aims of this project are that staff will:\r\nDevelop a greater awareness of international education systems, including similarities to and differences from our own education system.\r\nBe motivated and stimulated to try out new ideas and adopt new practice.\r\nTo be more confident in supporting others to develop their practice.\r\nUse an increasing number of and a more varied and effective range of strategies for supporting more able pupils to develop a more creative curriculum that promotes entrepreneurial mindsets.\r\nBe more confident about sharing good practice, within the school and across the borough and other schools nationally.\r\nIn addition, we believe the project will help us to build and extend opportunities for our children to communicate with their European counterparts (eg collaborative projects, exchanges, penpals, skype)\r\nThese aims will be achieved by the end of the project and in the longer term shared with others.", "http://www.rotherhitheprimaryschool.co.uk", "Rotherhithe Prmary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036031_coordinator"]]}}, "2XU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Abused no More: Safeguarding Youth & Empowering Professionals", "INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC RESEARCH STUDIES INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE", 318781.0, 5, 5, "At present, school education in the law and basic rights that would allow young people to lead their lives equally in modern European societies is almost non-existent. However, research supports that when people are given the basic legal knowledge to deal with everyday situations not only they stand a better chance in society, but also avoid consuming public services unnecessarily (IARS, 2010). The question of what make us legally capable becomes particularly timely in the current financial climate where more and more young people are struggling to cope, and the demand for legal advice is ever increasing. For young people, a legal problem \u2013 let that be crime or debt related, domestic violence or employment \u2013 will have a bigger impact. Starting out in life presents young people with enormous new challenges. Marginalised youth are even less likely to receive help or want to engage with the system and what is available to the mainstream population. However, communicating law related information through formal education or training to marginalised youth and those servicing them is not an easy task. International projects (e.g. Street Law, PLENET, Youth Empowerment Project) have shown that to achieve basic legal literacy among the public, including young people,  it must be carried out organically and in a user-led fashion. Therefore, in Europe, a gap is identified in the field of training, education and youth that could be filled through the free dissemination of a youth-led programme for service providers and young people with the aim of increasing their legal capability. The Abused no More (AnM) project will help to bridge this gap by focusing on increasing legal capacity in the areas of gender-based discrimination, exclusion and abuse against some of the most marginalised youth groups and in particular those who tend to be disadvantaged due to their gender and cultural differences (e.g. immigrants, refugees, descendants from immigrant families) and other social obstacles e.g. sexual orientation and ethnicity.Inspired and motivated by the priorities of the EU Youth Strategy, the AnM project will bring together young people and professionals to establish a cross-sector, transnational Strategic Partnership in order to design and implement innovative practices and come up with a set of reference documents (online & in print) that will: (a) empower marginalised youth (b) increase the capacity of service providers, notably in the areas of integration, equity and inclusion, gender-based abuse and discrimination.Focusing on the Europe 2020 Strategy, AnM aims to foster, migrant integration, social equity and inclusion through a two-tier approach i.e. by empowering and involving directly marginalised youth in its delivery, while at the same time increasing the capacity of organisations servicing them. In line with the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty to \"encourage the participation of young people in democratic life in Europe\", through non-formal learning activities and the development of an evidence-based training programme, AnM will promote innovation, exchange of experience and know-how between different types of organisations providing services to youth with fewer opportunities.AnM will be carried out in key EU locations (UK, Poland, Italy, Romania and Cyprus), building on the learning of partners' projects. It will:1. Map and analyse key concepts in the areas of marginalised young people' legal literacy, focusing on gender-based discrimination and exclusion2. Identify relevant innovative educational and training practices in the participating countries and produce a free report3. Organise seminars with partners to exchange learning and to perform cross-training activities4.  Design a free, user-led, face-to-face training package and pilot them in the participating countries5. Involve young people directly in the design and piloting of the programme engaging at least 20 young volunteers in each country6. Design and deliver an elearning course reaching at least 1000 organisations and individuals across Europe7. Set up and facilitate a wider network (database) in order to disseminate its practical results, exchange further best practices and ideas and ensure multiple effect and sustainability.8. Publish a book (online and in print) bringing together its 3 year learning and practical results, launch it at an international conference and disseminate internationally. The project will not only help the employability and social inclusion of the young people directly involved, but also bring positive and long-lasting effects on the participating organisations.

This accounts for about one fifth of the entire European population. The vast majority of them are young people, principally girls. According to the Erasmus KA2 (Youth) funded Care to Work project and EUROCARERS' statistics, young carers are faced with additional barriers to education, training and employment. The same research also suggests that early in life young carers develop a number of soft skills and competencies that with the right support can lead them into the development of their own social businesses and entrepreneurship activities. We also know that the economic savings that these young people make to their governments through their informal caring role is considerable. In fact, in Europe, the value of unpaid informal care in the community and at home is estimated from 50-90% of the overall cost of formal care provision. \r\n\r\nEncouraging entrepreneurship for youth is part of the European Reference Framework on Key Competences, while the Resolution adopted by the European Parliament in 2015 stressed the role of Social Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation in combating unemployment. \r\n\r\nAt a critical point for Europe when youth unemployment continues to rise, IARS has put together a strategic partnership of familiar and no so familiar to Erasmus organisations to run Care to Entrepreneurship (C2E) as a youth-led, transnational project that will develop, test and implement innovative practices in a much neglected area in the field of youth. Social entrepreneurial competences, such as business and strategic planning with a social dimension, will be the main pillar of the capacity building course curriculum to be developed for the young potential entrepreneurs of C2E.\r\n\r\nIn particular, C2E will:\r\n- construct new training curricula and courses (online and face-to-face) for young carers that will allow them to develop the necessary skills, knowledge and competences to become social entrepreneurs\r\n- test and implement these material in the UK, Greece,  Italy, Romania and Belgium, and use the comparative learning for informing EU-wide practices and policies\r\n- develop a youth-led evidence-base for the construction of the project's training and educational tools.\r\n\r\nHORIZONTAL PRIORITY\r\nC2E will promote inclusion, diversity, equality, gender-balance and non-discrimination in the education and training of young carers through innovative and integrated series of youth-led actions including volunteering. The \"Social Inclusion\" priority will be addressed through the fostering of social and inter-cultural competences and critical thinking that will help young carers to combat discrimination faced by them and their peers. Particular emphasis will be given on female carers given that (a) it is more likely for girls and young women to become young carers (b) they are more likely to be discriminated against due to their gender. C2E will also enhance access, participation and learning performance of these disadvantaged learners and through its courses help reduce disparities in learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nSECTORAL PRIORITIES\r\nAs a transnational youth-led initiative, C2E will 'Promote entrepreneurship education and social entrepreneurship among young people' by allowing young carers (with an emphasis on girls) to put their ideas into practice, including through social enterprises, tackling challenges and identified problems in their caring roles and lives. Social entrepreneurship constitutes a flourishing field of work, which not only facilitates young carers entering into the labour market, but also contributes to the community\u2019s well-being by solving pressing social issues and generating a positive return.\r\n\r\nC2E will also address the \"Promoting Empowerment\" priority by fostering the active citizenship and participation of young carers, one of the most neglected youth groups in European societies. Due to the youth-led methodology of C2E, young volunteers will be empowered and supported to carry out the research for the evidence base of the project, manage its development, quality control it and monitor its outputs. Taking into account the underlying European values and the ambitions of the Youth Strategy, C2E will empower young carers by giving them accredited training, skills, knowledge, tools and mind-sets to put \u201ctheir entrepreneurial ideas into practice\u201d, while serving their communities. Following this approach, challenges in the participating countries, which may have come as a result of persisting socio-economic crises, can be tackled in the long term with the introduction of new social enterprises designed and applied by the young participants of the project. C2E essentially grants a unique opportunity for young people to contribute to their communities while advancing their own career needs, receive accreditation and inform national and EU-wide policy.", "http://www.iars.org.uk", "INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC RESEARCH STUDIES INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA205-046402_coordinator"], [2014, "CARE 2 WORK", "INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC RESEARCH STUDIES INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE", 215013.0, 4, 4, "Images of the young carer can be traced as back as the 11th century. Whilst novels, and media images, tell us something about the changing nature and experience of young carers in Europe, surprisingly little knowledge has been gained from research or official statistics. So, whilst there is considerable literature which focuses on the lives and needs of informal carers in the community, most of this fails to examine in any depth the particular experiences and needs of young people who care (Fallon, 1990). This also means that the barriers and enablers for their educational, training and employment avenues remain largely unexplored. Due to this knowledge gap the extant curricula, methodologies, material, opportunities and courses are not always fit for purpose.\r\n\r\nDespite of being under the radar of educational and social justice policy, the number of young carers is not to be underestimated. Just in the UK it is estimated that there over 1.5 million carers below the age of 35. A quarter of them have being carers before the age of 16 (Parker, 1994). In Italy, there are 170,000 young carers and 25,000 (under 17) in Sweden. There are no national statistics on the young carers in Greece.\r\n\r\nWe also know from evidence that young carers face additional barriers to education, training and employment. For example, according to a research by Carers Trust, young carers aged between 16 and 18 years are twice as likely to be not in education, employment, or training (NEET) than their peers. According to Eurofund, young people with an immigration background are 70% more likely to become NEET compared to nationals.\r\n\r\nResearch has also showed that the majority of young carers tend to come from Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups (BAME). For instance, in the UK young carers are 1.5 times more likely than their peers to be from BAME communities, and are twice as likely to not speak English as their first language. We now have enough evidence to know that BAME groups continue to be disadvantaged in our modern society due to discrimination.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, providing care can also enable a young person to develop personally and to gain life skills that can also facilitate the transition to adulthood and lead to very positive outcomes for young carers.  It is also estimated that billions of Euros are saved by European public services due to young carers.\r\n\r\nYoung carers need to be given the recognition, opportunity and support to flower as individuals and as carers. Guidelines for action need to be based upon up to date evidence that involves them.\r\n\r\nThe Care 2 Work project aims to respond to this knowledge gap through a youth-led methodology. Inspired and motivated by the priorities of the EU Youth Strategy, the C2W project will bring together young people and professionals to establish a cross-sector, transnational Strategic Partnership in order to design and implement innovative practices and come up with a set of accredited, reference documents  that will: (a) empower young BAME carers (b) increase the capacity of service providers, notably in the areas of integration, equity and inclusion, and discrimination.\r\n\r\nFocusing on the Europe 2020 Strategy, C2W aims to foster integration, social equity and inclusion through a two-tier approach i.e. by empowering and involving directly marginalised youth in its delivery, while at the same time increasing the capacity of organisations servicing them.

Combined together these two characteristics make LGBT migrants and refugees one of the most vulnerable groups in modern Europe. Our project aims to help address this issue by increasing the knowledge, skills and awareness of all those adult professionals and volunteers who come in contact with them. According to UNHCR, in 2015, over 1.1 million migrants and refugees arrived in Europe. In 2016, this flow continues at a rate of 55,000 per month. Violence at the collective and personal level is the key driver that forces these individuals to abandon their homes. While doing so their basic needs and human rights are compromised. This also includes their free choice of identity, dignity and respect. It also includes being free to exercise their sexual orientation, have a partner from the same sex and develop a family life. It also includes exercising this right without being killed or bullied. However, the reality is different as a considerable proportion of refugees and migrants is in fact made homeless because of their sexual orientation (whether this is kept hidden or is revealed). The EU and modern Europe have signed treaties and Directives that aim to protect all individuals from persecution and discrimination on the grounds of their sexual orientation. Examples include the Right to Private and Family Life in the European Convention on Human Rights as well as the 2004 Directive stating unequivocally that those who face persecution for their sexual orientation and gender identity qualify as refugees and many reports showed how minorities, including LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual or transsexual) people. The European Parliament EU (2015/2325(INI)) also called on all Member States to adopt asylum procedures and endeavor to develop training programmes, which are sensitive to the needs of LGBT persons and especially women.These high-level, EU-wide policy initiatives must be complemented with on-the-ground, national and local educational efforts targeted at adult professionals and volunteers who work directly with LGBT migrants and refugees. This complementary work needs to have an EU wide impact and must be evidence based and user-led. Responding to this need, EpsiLon brings together key partners from 5 case study countries to develop a training programme for professionals and volunteers working with asylum seekers and refugees in asylum centres, camps, other shelters and in local communities. The partners come from key locations in Europe where the two cross-cutting themes of migration and LGBT discrimination are particularly acute. While we will look at Italy, Greece and Cyprus as locations where not much progress has been made for LGBT rights, we will explore the Netherlands and the UK as member states that have introduced progressive practices and policies in education and training for gay issues and rights. At the same time, Greece, Italy and Cyprus are case studies for migration flow and the so called crisis.EpsiLon will adopt a user-led methodology by constructing educational tools that are based on the voices and real needs of LGBT migrants and refugees. Through theses voices, learning will take place in the form of face-to-face and online. This will be promoted both internally (between partners) and externally (nationally and EU wide).  We will develop an innovative, evidence-based, user-led training methodology and contents targeting professionals and volunteers working in services for asylum seekers, refugees and migrants in order to raise their awareness and sensitivity to the needs of all those with LGBT background. The educational tools will enable the professionals to identify these LGBT groups' most current and urgent needs some even reaching on issues of survival, dignity and respect. It will also help them challenge their own biases. The need for the development of such training programme is highlighted at top level by all competent organisations such as UNHCR and the EP. The intellectual outputs of Epsilon will (a) reach widely outside of the participating countries through free, online access Europe-wide (b) continue being delivered after the project's funding is finished (c) reach groups in society that would not have been otherwise able to receive the face-to-face package and in print material (d) reward and formally accredit its target audiences.", "http://www.iars.org.uk", "INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC RESEARCH STUDIES INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA204-024317_coordinator"], [2014, "Travel and Tourism", "Blake Hall College Ltd", 157013.0, 2, 7, "This project will send young people studying a Level 3 BTEC travel and toursim qualification out to Tenerife, to complete a 6 week work placement.

In addition, 1.7 million people previously residing in one of the EU Member States migrated to another Member State.  Thus, about 3.4 million people immigrated to one of the EU-27 Member States.  Among them, a variable percentage from 51% (Italy) to 43% (Germany) were women. Germany reported the largest number of immigrants (592 200) in 2012, followed by the United Kingdom (498 000) and Italy (350 800). Spain reported the highest number of emigrants in 2012 (446 600), followed by the United Kingdom (321 200) and Poland (275 600). \r\n\r\nEvidence indicate persistent issues impacting on their integration and employment. Very often, newly arrived migrants struggle to find a decent job, while they are faced with a number of integration issues including gender inequality and cultural bias. Furthermore, many experience long periods of inactivity, unemployment, or long tenures in the so-called 3Ds job: Dirty, Dangerous and Demanding and are often not adequately paid or regularly insured. \r\n\r\nMoreover, when migrants are skilled and qualified in their country of origin, they experience \u201cbrain waste\u201d, face difficulties in putting their qualification to good use and therefore are at risk of frustration and de-motivation.  On the other hand, not being able to fully profit of the skills and capacities of migrants is also an unnecessary waste for the countries of destination, who are not in measure to fruitfully build on the competences of their migrant workers. \r\n\r\nA recent report by The Migration Policy Institute (Benton, 2014) pointed out that one of the ways to overcome these difficulties is the early provision of relevant career advice, with specialized work-force and dedicated service organizations. However, there is a lack of tailored and adequate understanding of the real needs and challenges faced by migrants particularly in relation to issues impacting on their gender. The guidance sector remains quite heterogeneous and there are no requirements for quality standards or for the qualification of staff. This is why more and more professionals as well as representatives of users claim compulsory quality standards and guidelines. \r\n\r\nConsequently, The Council Resolutions on Lifelong Guidance (2004 and 2008), with the establishment of the European Commission\u2019s Expert Group Lifelong Guidance and the foundation of the ELGPN - European Lifelong Guidance Policy Network recommended the development of a European lifelong guidance policy. \r\n\r\nMOVE ON intends to build on this EU-wide recommendation by contributing to strengthening the skills and capacities of adult learners in the participating organisations, countries and across Europe with the ultimate goal of enhancing their skills and knowledge in providing the right career guidance and counseling to EU migrants paying particular attention to issues impacting on gender and culture as these are manifested at the recruitment stage but also at the workplace and remuneration.\r\n\r\nThe training material and programmes resulting from MOVE ON will be CPD accredited (Continuing Professional Development), giving our participant adult learners an extra incentive while also adding to their CV and qualification. Where young people are involved we will provide them with YouthPass (IARS is a provider of both types of qualifications).\r\n\r\nUsing a user-led methodology and by building on evidence from existing best practices, the project will exchange innovative models:\r\n(1) to give staff of partner organizations the opportunity to participate to a dedicated and proven accredited training programme originally developed in Germany concerning gender and culturally sensitive guidance services to migrants; \r\n(2) to share knowledge and successful practices across Europe concerning methods currently in use in the partner countries \r\n(3) to identify the profile requirements of  career advisors for migrants paying particular attention to issues of gender and culture.\r\n\r\nThe comparative and transnational dimension of the project as well as its user-led methodology for evaluation and control will act as its main innovative driving factors. We know that the level of awareness and development of practices in this domain is different from country to country. Germany has a consolidated background, and the same is in Spain but limited to the gendered perspective; while in Italy, Poland and Greece the topic of dedicated and tailored counseling practices is still under-developed. In the UK, although equality legislation is well advanced, issues of immigration, employment and integration are acute.

Encouraging entrepreneurship for youth is part of the European Reference Framework on Key Competences, while the Resolution adopted by the European Parliament in 2015 stressed the role of Social Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation in combating unemployment. Social entrepreneurial competences, such as business and strategic planning with a social dimension, will be the main pillar of the capacity building course curriculum to be developed for the young potential entrepreneurs within the scope of PROMYSE. Elements of entrepreneurship education such as marketing and promotion will form part of the course curriculum. Social entrepreneurship constitutes a flourishing field of work, which not only facilitates entering into the labour market, but also doing so contributes to the community\u2019s well-being by solving pressing social issues of the society, generating a positive return in society. PROMYSE seeks to exploit this advantage by (re)skilling youth accordingly to actively join this field. The project will provide the young participants with the fundamental skills, knowledge, tools and mind-sets to put \u201ctheir entrepreneurial ideas into practice\u201d, while serving the community as well. Following this approach, challenges in the participating countries, which may have come as a result of persisting socio-economic crises, can be tackled in the long term with the introduction of new health and social care services, designed and applied by the young participants of the project. PROMYSE essentially grants a unique opportunity for young people to contribute to their communities while advancing their own career needs.\r\n\r\nThe second Sectoral Priority (YOUTH) is 'Promoting high-quality youth work, particularly in the processes related to youth development'. The project partners, active in the youth work field, will gain considerable insight on identifying and analyzing the needs of youth, especially with regards to education and training, and will build their internal capacities to better meet those needs. The project lays down activities that intend to satisfy the needs of young NEETS, setting fertile ground for applying their creativity and initiative. In this sense, partners are implicated in crucial youth work aiming at engaging with youth to deal with issues like unemployment, low educational attainment and social exclusion. The Role of Youth work is stressed in the EU Youth Strategy, which stipulates that youth work \u201ccontributes to all fields of action [of the Strategy] and their identified objectives\u201d. Youth work is elevated in PROMYSE by the increased capacities of the organisations as a consequent of implementing the activities but at the same time promoting employability of young people in this sector while providing recognition of the skills for conducting this work in a transnational framework (Youthpass and CPD Accreditation). The project equips young people with the necessary skills to get involved in youth work themselves, since the health and social care sector is a field directly related to improving the conditions of subsistence for children and young people.\r\n\r\nFinally, the project will address Horizontal Priority 'Open and innovative practices in a digital era', by developing and providing a modern, integrated and holistic e-learning and networking platform, tailor-made to the needs of young prospective social entrepreneurs. This will allow them to develop and enhance their social entrepreneurship and business skills; improve their understanding in social entrepreneurship principles and community needs in the field of health and social care; and identify social entrepreneurship and collaboration opportunities. At the same time the e-platform will provide the young beneficiaries will then open area where they can create informal and formal cooperative networks interact with each other, exchange concerns, ideas, experiences and seek opportunities of collaboration on a European level. The innovative aspect of the developed e-platform will be enhanced by utilizing the game theory, integrating game mechanics and elements that generate higher engagement and increased adoption rate by the target group.", "http://www.iars.org.uk", "INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC RESEARCH STUDIES INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA205-035438_coordinator"], [2017, "Early School Leavers: Drop-in", "INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC RESEARCH STUDIES INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE", 134492.0, 5, 5, "Early school leaving (ESL) and dropping-out are often seen as the fault of young people. We see them as the results of disengagement towards the formal education system, mistrust in the ability of education for securing future employment and negative learning experiences (e.g. see Ten Steps to Equity in Education, 2008). As a result, certain groups of young people remain without basic qualifications and with low skills, which significantly increases the likelihood of unemployment or precarious work, exacerbated by the effects of the economic recession. In turn, the absence of young people from the labour market is a significant detriment to socio-economic advancements, evidencing on one hand a deficit in youth-related policies and on the other hand ponderous youth civic participation. \r\n4 out of the 5 countries participating in the proposed project demonstrate high rates in youth unemployment. According to Eurostat\u2019s figures of 2015: GR-47.9%, CY-32.5%, IT-39.8% and RO-21.5% (the EU average is 20% and the UK rate 11.5%). This demonstrates the need to learn from each other. It also signals the need for non-formal and innovative ways of developing skills for youth to match modern labour market needs. For example, we know that non-formal education and training should be perceived \u201cas a valid alternative to general academic education... enabling young people to become active in the labour market and... of equal value as more academic pathways towards employment\u201d (Solidar Foundation, 2014). Especially for vulnerable populations, non-formal learning can offer these alternative opportunities; it can address skills shortages provide a fertile ground for learning and the transition to employment, as well as foster social inclusion (EC, Education & Training Monitor, 2013).\r\nTherefore, there is a need to work trans-nationally to enhance the basic and transversal skills and competences of young people who have dropped out of the formal education system (with emphasis on NEETs), (re)introducing them in informal and non-formal learning, based on an innovative, tailor-made capacity-building model, with the aim to ultimately facilitate their socio-economic (re)integration and employability. Thus we propose \"Drop-in\". This will be delivered through a strategic partnership that includes: The IARS International Institute (UK), KMOP (Greece), InEuropa (Italy), CARDET (Cyprus) and The Schottener Foundation Social Services (Romania).\r\nDROP-IN will target the horizontal priority \u201cOpen and innovative practices in a digital era\u201d by developing and making available a modern, integrated and holistic e-learning and networking platform, tailor-made to the skills, capacities, earning and development needs of young drop-outs and ESLs across Europe. One of the project\u2019s innovative aspects is the use of game elements and the application of game mechanics in the development and application of the online learning to facilitate the learning procedure. Combined with the youth-led nature of the project as well as the accreditation that we will achieve through YouthPass and CPD, this innovative aspect of the e-course will make it more attractive, rewarding and engaging to young people, especially those who have been withdrawn early from the formal educational system and had shown very little or no interest in re-engaging with formal education. This idea came from our preparatory work with the IARS Youth Advisory Board the involvement of which will be engaged in order to deliver a youth-led management and quality control of DROP-IN.\r\nFurthermore, we know that education and training systems need to enable all learners to achieve their potential by understanding and embracing the diversity of their needs, regardless of socio-economic, cultural, educational or other differences. Therefore, DROP-IN will target Horizontal priority \"Social Inclusion\", by targeting drop-outs/ESLs who are outside the formal structures of society often because of a combination of personal, educational, economic and social circumstances leading to a higher risk of being socio-economically excluded. This group has fewer opportunities of education and training which the project recuperates for, by developing a tailor-made programme providing for the validation of the acquired skills by the targeted young population, therefore paving the way for more inclusive opportunities in education, training and the labour market. The project will also enhance the quality and relevance of the learning offered through non-formal education and training by directly linking labour market demands to the needs and wishes of our target group.\r\nFinally, as a youth-led project, DROP-IN will address Youth Sectoral priority \"Promoting Empowerment\" by introducing, piloting and implementing new, innovate and effective youth-led methodologies for enhancing the basic and transversal skills of the specific disadvantaged group of young drop-outs and ESLs, offering  additionally a Youthpass and CPD certificates", "http://www.iars.org.uk", "INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC RESEARCH STUDIES INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA205-035400_coordinator"], [2018, "MOPPPI - MOBILITE DES PERSONNELS DE LA PENITENTIAIRE, PROBATION ET INSERTION CHARGES DES PERSONNES SOUS MAIN DE JUSTICE", "Restorative Justice for All", 59145.0, 3, 3, "The mobility project KA104 \"MOPPPI\", is presented upon the initiative of a consortium of organizations from the Bordeaux Metropolis involved with the education, probation and integration of adults under juducial control, namely: The Penitentiary Center of Bordeaux-Gradignan, the Integration and Probation Service of Gironde (SPIP), INSUP a non-profit training organization for the qualification and integration of disadvantaged groups, including prisoners, the association ALIFS which offers cultural activities in prisons and MAI 33, a help centre that provides information and support to prisoners and their relatives.\r\n\r\nThe project proposes the implementation of a European mobility training scheme for the professionals  of these institutions and the volunteers of MAI 33, in order to promote awareness to Europe within the institutions, the training of their personnel and the implementation of European rules meant to foster actions and schemes to promote education, training, prevention of recidivism and integration of prisoners detained or persons subjected to alternative sentences.\r\n\r\nTo meet this purpose, the consortium partners are interested in gaining information, researching and identifying in the context of training courses or job shadowing missions next to European counterparts, the existing best practices likely to be adopted and disseminated within French establishments.\r\n\r\nThe participants in the mobility actions will be officers and staff from the penitentiary administration, SPIP probation officers, INSUP trainers, an ALIFS cultural action worker and MAI 33 volunteers who will take part in 5 flows of 1-week mobility events in Europe to attend a training course or be involved in job shadowing with counterparts.\r\n\r\nThe expected results for the 40 beneficiaries planned are: Openness to Europe, improvement of their professional and intercultural skills, identification of best practices and redynamisation of the teams for increased efficiency and a renewed vision of their mission in connection with the target group.

Our main aim is to provide students with the knowledge and skills required by the labour market and the economy, while allowing them to play an active role in society and achieve personal fulfilment. Special emphasis is placed on autonomy since this skill proves to be essential for the successful completion of all the educational stages.  \r\nThis project could have a very significant impact on the achievement of our main aim because it constitutes an excellent opportunity to exchange knowledge and experience with professionals from other EU countries. This, is turn, would improve our staff\u2019s professional competence and guarantee our school quality and international projection. \r\nHaving analyzed the sociocultural and academic background of our school community, 4 areas for improvement have been identified, which are included in our European Development Program and suggested in the project\u2019s title: \u201cInclusive Education for a 21st-century School\u201d. \u201cInclusive education\u201d refers to 2 of the areas identified, namely: the need to 1) improve school management and the quality of our education so as to achieve 2) a more cohesive school community in which the inclusion of sociocultural diversity and individual talents would be more effective. 40.30% of our students belong to families from 21 different countries. Besides, one can find a high degree of diversity among students in terms of abilities and talents, a diversity derived from factors related to situations of socio-economic (dis)advantage, linguistic compensation and learning disorders. An improvement of school management will definitely enhance inclusive education. In this respect, our point of departure is a solid system of measures to support teachers, students and families, which we aim to develop by exploring and creating new measures of mutual support. \u201cA 21st century school\u201d refers to the two other areas for improvement: the need to 3) improve teachers\u2019 professional and linguistic competences and to 4) foster internationalization and a sense of belonging to the EU. Our teaching team is highly qualified thanks to an annual plan of permanent training. As a result of this, we have successfully implemented a methodological approach based on the acquisition of key skills through tasks and projects and on Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL). In the light of this approach, we have developed interdisciplinary multilingual projects praised as innovative educational practices by specialized publications. 5 of this projects have been developed on eTwinning, a platform which has played a key role in the selection of project partners. As regards internationalization, this project will enable us to reinforce cooperation with schools we have already collaborated with through eTwinning and to get in touch with other schools for future international projects. The benefit derived from this will be double: we will import good practices and will export our own, an exchange which will greatly improve teaching skills and inclusion at our school while reinforcing a sense of belonging a union of countries characterized by its value and preservation of cultural diversity. \r\nThe selection of participants and mobility actions has been determined by the aforementioned areas of improvement. The project will last 1 academic year; 4 to 6 teachers will participate in a total number of 7 mobility activities. 3 of these activities will be job shadowing experiences in schools in different countries (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom). Every participant will import good practices related to teaching, assessment, management and attention to diversity. This same teacher will export our practices and will invite the school to collaborate in our Postcrossing project. The 4 other mobility activities are training courses in the United Kingdom (2), Finland and Sweden, which deal with school management, foreign language teaching, innovative teaching and inclusive education, respectively. The project will also have a deep impact on the school community and on schools not directly participating in the project thanks to the dissemination of tangible and intangible results by means of meetings, seminars, workshops and regular publications online and in the press. With a view to integrate the project\u2019s achievements in our strategic future, we will take part in conferences and training courses to share our project\u2019s impact and to enlarge our network of potential partners.

In recent years, as traditional social structures have weakened, the role of the school has become even more relevant in this respect.  Developing the 'whole child' has become more important than the traditional focus on  delivering a narrow curriculum of pure, academic subjects.  Meanwhile, concern about the health and well-being of Europe's citizens is growing as economists note the financial implications of an increasingly less active, less healthy, longer living population.  Our 'obesity crisis' is repeatedly referenced as a future economic risk to European success.  \r\n\r\nBringing together these 2 issues is the focus of our project.  How can educators develop the traditional role of schools to focus more firmly on Health and Well - Being and ensure we foster positive, 'inclusive' experiences of physical education and healthy eating?  How can schools encourage positive attitudes in all pupils and set them on a path to fitness for life and a healthier, more productive future?  \r\n\r\nThe task begins with up-skilling current and future teachers to lead the attitudinal change we require from all educational sectors.  This project seeks to do that by bringing together a number of high achieving schools, aware of this need to 'educate for life', as well as Universities with a Teacher Training remit--including a focus on training Physical Education teachers.  \r\n\r\nThe partnership consists primarily of a University and 2 schools in each of three countries--the UK,  Spain and Greece.  (An additional partner of a University based fitness facility adds additional expertise and resources to complement the other UK partners and  bring the total number in the partnership to 10.)  \r\n\r\nThe group have agreed a 2 year work-plan of collaboration in order to exchange knowledge, bring more focus to the Pupil Health & Well - Being agenda and develop joint resources.   4  joint,  transnational meetings  and a program of on-going  local activities to strengthen education are planned.  Joint activities between the schools and Universities involved will be supported.  \r\n\r\nOngoing research, knowledge sharing, the development of resources and dissemination & evaluation will all take place as the partnership work together to develop 6 training modules, which the 3 University partners have agreed to incorporate into their future teacher training.  The modules will focus on teaching and learning styles, behavioral change, cultural influence and inclusion in schools, as well as more traditional aspects of physical education.  They will also form the foundation of our final year training event  following our last transnational meeting\u2014a trial run for an ongoing in-service course offer for school staff across Europe, to be offered year on year following the project's end.  This annual course will be advertised on the EU Erasmus + Key Action 1 course database and be self-funding, with each of the 3 countries involved hosting it in turn and with a transnational partnership cohort delivering.  \r\n\r\nAll lesson plans and resources produced by the project will be offered free to those who take part, as well as generally via the project web site, which will be funded to continue for a minimum of 5 additional years.\r\n\r\nThe schools involved are high achieving and focused on 'education for life'. Many of them succeed in areas with high levels of deprivation.  The Universities are all long standing trainers of future teachers with different approaches to the tutoring of general teachers as well as specifically to the development of future Physical Education teachers.  We want to combine these approaches to develop the most coherent training possible for current and future teachers, allowing them to begin the process of expanding the remit of their teaching and their schools to focus more effectively on establishing healthy patterns of living.  This will initially be within the organizations in the partnership, but over the life of this project, should spread locally via local dissemination activities and finally, across a wider European area as the end products are disseminated via our ongoing delivery of our  European in-service course for school staff.  \r\n\r\nMethodology  will be scientific and rigorously tested.   Meanwhile, the results of our project will be apparent early on in the practice of  the institutions collaborating.  Curriculum changes in our partner Universities and a whole school focus on Pupil Health in our partner schools will  develop rapidly.
