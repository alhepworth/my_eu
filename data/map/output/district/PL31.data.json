La Rocha, Telde (ES) and Oberschule Bederkesa, Bad Bederkesa (D).The project title \u201eConfederation of Europia\u201c speaks for itself, in that a state will be established.To ensure the success of this state, partner school teachers will firstly create six teaching units which focus on the development of the core themes of democracy and elections as well as the establishment of businesses and job application training. During a staff meeting teaching sequences will be devised and the project\u2019s own teaching and learning materials will be created. These teaching units will form the technical basis from which students will be motivated to turn theoretical ideas into practical applications. Towards the end of the first project year the first unit on democracy will be delivered, and election campaigns will take place simultaneously in all schools. The presidential candidates will give campaign speeches and all students of the school vote for their president. After the presidential election, the four school sites become \"Federal Lands\", that join together to form the \"Confederation of Europia\" and students become \"Citizens of Europia\" for two school years. The term of office lasts one year, and new Presidential elections will be held for the second academic year.The territory of the Confederation will contain two time zones - Europia East Time (EET) and Europia Atlantic Time (EAT) \u2013which will be documented cartographically with the \"Europia-Map\". In order that the Confederation can present a \u2018statesmanlike\u2019 front in its dealings with the outer world, \u201ccitizens\u201d will compose a National Anthem.Internal governing of the state must be efficient. For this, the state-website www.confed-europia.eu will be established. This website serves to maintain communication and to document the \"State Events\".In addition, the website is the publishing platform for another central pillar of society - the media: citizens or \"foreign\" interested parties can check the online newspaper \"Europia Times\" for an update on current events in the Confederation and \"Europia TV\" which will provide video reports on current issues in the EU.The teaching units in the fields of economics will provide the \"citizens\" with the skills to establish \"companies\". These companies will be open for business for the duration of a project week, when the other Federal Lands visit as part of a project meeting for a \"state visit\".In the host \"Federal Land\" the citizens will have developedsound business ideas with advertising strategies, as well as cost estimates for operating resources and manpower in order to get a start-up loan from the state. Then they present their companies, along with any job opportunities in the virtual \"Job Market\" on the state's website. Prior to arriving in the Federal Land, visiting students will have created their application portfolios including a CV in the relevant foreign language, and applied for the jobs.  By undertaking successful bilateral online interviews with the company founders, the job seeker qualifies for a passport as an 'employee'. It is also anticipated that Citizens with their own business ideas will arrive as an \"entrepreneur\" for Project Week. Some Citizens will, along with their host Citizen, undertake a real work experience placement in the tourism industry. Of course, the President, their \"Diplomats\" and the media representatives (\"journalist\") will also receive a passport. During project weeksthe \"Diplomats\" work on the state map or the national anthem. Should any disputes develop among Citizens, then \"mediators\" (previously trained over a period of several weeks by means of one of the teaching units) can be deployed. During project weeks with open days, the \"Presidents\" will provide information about their \"Federal Land\" via an informationstand, they will discuss the project with visitors/\"customers\" and gather their views, and will officially represent their Land on the occasion of the State Banquets, whether or not local or EU politicians attend too.In the third year the Confederation will work closely with a banking association to launch a new state currency - the \"Uto\". This currency requires well-designed and counterfeit-proof bills. Then in the last state visit a \"currency reform\" will be carried out.All \"State Events\" and project results will be available at any time on the state's website and will demonstrate a high level of competence among Citizens in the fieldsof democracy, entrepreneurship and media usage. All teaching units will be summarised in the four national languages of the project partners, together with a photo-documentary-film, in the E-book \"Confederation of Europia- a project-week\". The E-book will be available free of charge on the state's website, for interested parties inside and outside educational fields.", "http://www.bodmincollege.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE03-KA219-023022_1"]]}}, "2JH": {"esif": {"data": [[1483228800000, 1575072000000, "Family Learning \u2013 Routes to Improved Health and Wellbeing", "Pre School Learning Alliance", "Our project uses family learning to engage unemployed and economically inactive adults to start the process of removing their barriers to the labour market and as a gateway / pathway to further education, training and employment opportunities.", "ESF", 106229.0, 133053.0, "esf_england_791"]]}}, "2QL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1380585600000, 1475193600000, "High throughput integrated technologies for multimaterial functional  Micro Components", "Flann Microwave Limited", "Volume production at industrial scale of miniaturised multi-material 3D (polymer-polymer, metal-polymer, metal-metal, polymer-ceramics,...) still face important challenges to be affordable by SMEs. Challenges not only in terms of precision manufacturing (precision engineering <0.01%) but also in the adequate interaction between the different constituent materials.\nBesides multi-material micro-system manufacturing processes still show to be time and cost consuming mainly from assembling activities and back en processes (35-60% of the total manufacturing costs come only from the assembling), so further research efforts in alternative and more integrated manufacturing concepts(over-moulding of micro-components and in-mould assembly technology would avoid the assembly step) are needed.\nTo answer those problems the development of high-throughput and cost-efficient process chains based on micro injection should consider the following aspects:\n\u2022 Improved volume production, not only from the standpoint of the necessary accuracy and performance of the process, but also regarding the interaction/bonding of the different materials which make up the produced parts and the possibility of selective functionality of their surfaces.\n\u2022 The integration of the different processes including the feeding and handling systems for automatic operation in order to eliminate human intervention and manufacturing costs.\n\u2022 Analyse the most suitable process control, online verification and back-end processes taking into account the features of the multi-material replicated parts represented by five demonstrators.\nThe aim is to reduce manufacturing costs up to 40%.
