To generate such power turbine rotorblade diameters exceeding 100m along with nacelle heights of 120m are becoming standard. As turbines grow and their deployment becomes more widespread and remote, it is becoming increasingly important that systems are put in place to monitor their condition in real time. Such monitoring offers significant cost of ownership savings through condition based maintenance, reduced downtime and a reduced likelihood of catastrophic failure.\n\nEven though important efforts have taken place lately towards condition based maintenance, there has been limited action concerning the \u201cnext step\u201d, which should take place after the localisation of potential damage (in regards to the reparation of the blades). Existing solutions require (in most cases) the disassembly of the turbine blades and shipping to specialized composite repair facilities, which results in increased time and money requirements. Should appropriate tooling be available to enable in-situ repair of turbine blades, it is estimated that large-scale reductions could be achieved (both in terms of time and money).\n\nWithin this project novel adapted tooling will be developed, which complies to wind turbine specificities and requirements (easily mounted, lightweight, fast and robust equipment) in order to enable the in-situ performance of the three major composite repair steps: Non Destructive Inspection, Surface Preparation, Hot Bonding.\n\nAccording to the developments of this project, which will enable in-situ repair of turbine blades for a wide variety of cases, it is estimated that large-scale reductions could be achieved both in terms of system availability and cost by minimizing the cases that require disassembly of blades and transportation to repair shop for rehabilitation.'", 158640.0, 979472.0, 5, 9, "CORETO", null, "http://www.bs-rotor.com", null, "fp7_103963_956096312"], [1375315200000, 1438300800000, "Wind turbine blade Anti / De-icing, combined Ultrasonic guided wave and vibration system", "Bs Rotor Technic (Uk) Ltd", "The DeICE-UT project will overcome the current limitations of existing wind turbine blade de-icing systems by developing an innovative dual de-icing system combining both high power ultrasonic guided waves and low frequency vibrations.
