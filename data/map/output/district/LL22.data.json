This will have a profound impact on education, the economy and society in the future. Technological changes will be even more pervasive and global competition will increase, not least the competition for talented people. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen policies to make EU ready for this competition and to give young Europeans opportunities to learn and to develop their capacities. There is a need to improve mobility both in quantity and quality at the EU level, and consequently a strong concern on the part of EU institutions to reach this goal. The overall percentage of young people which actually engages in transnational mobility activities remains low and compares unfavourably with higher education. Nevertheless, it appears with clarity that this training component is largely underdeveloped compared with other subjects in the VET-curricula. Some main barriers must be addressed if learning mobility is to be extended. The project seeks to address the above-mentioned needs and intends to respond to the Erasmus + priorities by setting the aim to improve the quality and quantity of mobility experiences adopting an integrated approach that involves both students and VET teaching staff. SKILLS + will be articulated into 2 different phases: during preliminary phase, 52 teachers will have an experience abroad and they'll jointly define with peers the contents of work placement, and the formalisation of MoU setting out the general framework of cooperation and networking between the partner institutions as well as establishing a climate of mutual trust. The second core phase of the project will be focused on the mobility experiences of 185 students from nine schools located in Vicenza its province, one located in Padua and in Verona. Learners will stay abroad for a period of 4 weeks of high quality work placement and 2 days of preparation/induction provided by partner abroad.  The project proposal intends to foster KSC,  of young learners in line with training needs of the local and global labour market. The multi- sectorial project is aimed at students who are completing the course of study and has the purpose to develop professional and soft skills, to improve the learning of foreign language and intercultural awareness. The schools involved encompass a range of professional pathways: Tourism\\Catering, Administration, Finance and Marketing, International Relations and Trade, Agriculture and Food Industry,ICT, Mechanics\\Mechatronics\\ Electronics, Transport and Logistics, Social Services and Healthcare. These sectors can be recognized as key drivers of the EU economic recovery in supporting growth and employment also for labour markets entrants. The partnership brings together 29 partners from ten different countries (IT, DE, NL, SLO,IE,UK,FI,DK,ES, FR) and is constructed with a view into achieving the highest synergies among the different partners. The methodological framework of the project builds on existing methods and practices which are already in use in the partners\u2019 countries or developed in other EU-funded projects (VQTS matrix, ECMO, TRIF, etc.) where CPV and other partner organisations are involved. In designing and implementing the mobility schemes the project will built on the assumption that modern work processes involve many similar tasks despite national differences in the manners of offering and organising training. The project proposal will be implemented through following stages: BEFORE MOBILITY mainly focused on preparation of participants, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY ACTIVITIES and FOLLOW UP/DISSEMINATION activities. The project intends to have a significant impact on public and private key actors of the partners\u2019 countries and the respective national, regional, local.  The project contributes to enhance partners\u2019 national VET systems through:\r\n\r\n- the promotion of internationalisation and mobility strategies, linked with the quality assurance systems for placements, monitoring contents and recognition of skills acquired  abroad;\r\n\r\n- the improvement of the quality in VET also significantly contributing to the further development of the competence of staff organising mobility as well as teachers, trainers and tutors involved. The EU added value of the project is, furthermore, the support provided to the implementation of common EU tools and methods for mobility quality assurance. for the implementation of an effective ECVET system for comparability and portability of VET qualifications in full compliance with EQF principles. Young beneficiaries who will participate in SKILLS + will have the motivation to act as mobility promoters, being natural and approachable ambassadors as they are able to speak the same language and use social media to share their experiences with friends who are not directly affiliated to mobility programmes.", "http://www.emrysapiwan.conwy.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT01-KA102-000119_8"], [2015, "Work In Progress", "Ysgol Emrys ap Iwan", 285266.0, 5, 17, "Project WIP will involve 120 students attending the 4th and 5th (final) year of 4 vocational schools based in Sicily and 3 based in Veneto region. \r\nFields of study involved relate to the production of goods and services carried out primarily by micro-enterprises and private-social organizations.

The students will carry out traineeship in firms where they have the chance to observe goals and organization of the company, new ways of working network, co-working  and to and work in team.\r\nAmong the host companies there are some working in the high technology services sector, social services, offices. Some of them have already been involved in previous projects of some of the schools and they have been selected according to the location and to the different economical features of the districts.\r\nThe host organizations are training agencies and companies which offer the participants good chances to hold a professional position during their stay. \r\nThey agreed to commit themselves to make the validation of the learning process possible according to ECVET procedures.

Schools aim to work on an international dimension of their activities and training offer.\r\nThe goal from the point of view of the issue is spreading among young people the importance of CSR as a tool to promote smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The Veneto Region since 2006 launched ad hoc initiatives to encourage the spread of this new concept of entrepreneurship. Companies more careful to the challenges of the future have already recognised the validity of the 'triple bottom line'model\u2019 (which notes the impact of corporate behavior on the economic, social and environmental level). The school in its process of opening up to Europe and the world cannot help but  wonder about the relationship between CSR and globalization, making itself interpreter of a sustainable  internationalization.\r\nThe beneficiaries of the  biennial mobility project are: a) 120 VET students of economic, commercial and marketing area; 10 staff members.\r\nThe learners mobility will last five weeks, and wants to develop a moment of pedagogical training which increase personal capacity and skills, such as language civic and social competences, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, digital competence, cultural awareness and expression. IRES will promote the increase of organizational, managerial and operational skills/competences, starting from the assumption that SMEs are placed in an increasingly competitive global scenario. The internship will be placed within the educational curriculum, on the basis of a training agreement. The experience will use the methodologies ECVET. The selected host countries are: Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Ireland.\r\nThey have been carefully chosen not only considering the foreign languages studied in the schools, but taking into account the different economic history of each one and then the different  way of implementation of CSR. The foreign partners are established reality in the field of training, expert about design, management, implementation of European projects in relation to staff and learners training,  and to vocational training in the company of students and graduates.\r\nAs for staff mobility, emphasis was placed to seek partners already active in the ErasmusPlus  field and particularly reliable. They are able not only to strengthen the language skills but offer job shadowing experiences that allow a) the transfer of best practices in use in partner countries schools; b) the strengthening of cooperation with local and transnational bodies involved in the partnership network.\r\nThe impact on learners will be the development of professional, personal and international skills and competences as tools to facilitate integration into the labor market and the reading enterprises\u2019 needs. In this light, the training will be built in such a way as to allow  the recognition of alternation, and certification awarded enrich personal portfolio. The expected impact on the partners of the Consortium / Network (both local and international) will be in the primarily the willingness to participate in further editions and similar initiatives. Moreover,  thanks to their direct participation in specific phases of the project, this will be a moments of  quality improvement about  non-formal training offered by their organizations.\r\nIn this framework the Consortium is born from the assumption of multidisciplinary and integrated CSR nature, so it is necessary to proceed with a synergic action among educational, sectorial and territorial institutions. A key role naturally will have businesses (Pinze Schio, Rigoni di Asiago, FORTES Social Enterprise) but also stakeholders (trade associations, chambers of commerce), that through active involvement and partnership with multi-stakeholder approach, can encourage the process which IRES aims.", "http://www.emrysapiwan.conwy.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT01-KA102-004377_1"], [2015, "All for a greener Europe", "Ysgol Emrys ap Iwan", 173048.0, 8, 8, "The project  \u201d All  for a greener  Europe\u201d  is based on mutual interest of the participants towards a more environmentally conscious life and is devoted to work on topics related to nature, green tourism and eco tourism. It is composed of seven countries Abergele-Conwy (Wales), Istanbul(Turkey), Bremen(Germany), Bydgoszcz (Poland), Gran Canary (Spain), Karlskrona (Sweden), Horjul (Slovenia), La Spezia (Italy). All of the participating countries are aware of the dramatic situation caused by Global warming and are aware of the fact that transportation, travelling and tourism are also contributors to the greenhouse effect.\r\n\r\nOur main goal is to analyse current trends in tourism and promote future trends which are inter-twinned with culture, traditions environment and heritage. By involving international cooperation, we will compare cultural and eco-tourism with standard tourism and solve tourism related problems finding new creative methods and techniques.\r\nThe main issues are to provide students and teachers with a deeper understanding of responsible tourism and to widen their knowledge in subjects connected to culture, history, traditions, gastronomy, environmental protection, English language and ICT whilst integrating students who come from different cultural backgrounds\r\n\r\nThe project promotes a development away from typical consumer oriented tourism towards tourism that focuses on cultural and environmental encounters and requires more responsibility from the key figures in tourism: tourists and specialists in tourism alike.\r\nCompleting the project tasks and activities (visiting each other\u2018s countries, making mini\u2013tour guides and itineraries, creating presentations and booklets etc.) will prepare our students to become open-minded, culture-conscious citizens and skilled travellers, who are consciously protecting the value of their touristic environment.\r\nInternational cooperation - common methods based on cooperative learning - will let us build a group and will promote collaboration. The project will put schools into cooperation with local, national and international institutions and organisations and it will encourage cross-curricular approaches. In order to get the partners to work towards a common purpose, staff will interact effectively with each other, creating international teams and sharing experiences whilst providing a unique opportunity for partners to input their own expertise and learn from each other.\r\n\r\nThe project will have both intangible results (new content learned by the participants, improved learning in relevant subject areas, new skills acquired )and tangible results (concrete products). We will use the outcomes as a measure of the extent to which the project has contributed to the learning experiences of those involved and the quality of education on offer in the schools participating. The partnership will have a positive impact on the participating institutions by building a community consisting of teachers and students who have  a strong commitment to and a sense of ownership of the project. By creating and carrying out several creative dissemination techniques and activities, it will also enable a wider community (stakeholders, parents, school authorities, hotels )to benefit from our partnership in the long run.", "http://www.emrysapiwan.conwy.sch.uk", "Ysgol Emrys ap Iwan", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013396_coordinator"]]}}}}
