For that purpose, we want to make their cities accessible to all the pupils, whatever their origin and beyond the economic, cultural or linguistic obstacles they meet. We wish that all the pupils allow themselves to become actors of the territories they live : their school, their district, their city, their country, Europe.It is by the knowledge of their own culture and its specificities that the children will discover the culture of the other countries, wonder about the similarities and the differences and thus grasp an objective illustrated by the motto of European Union : United in diversity. It is more widely a question of bringing the children to build themselves an European culture through the discovery of five participating cities : Athens, Belfast, Paris, Rome and Tallinn.The first step will be to go to the rediscovery of their own environment , their school and their district, in order to share it with the partners schools. Then the children will explore their city discovering its main monuments, its means of transport, the vision of their city by the artists. Finally, they will wonder how they can participate actively in the preservation and in the embellishment of their environment by simple ecological gestures .It is by the exchange of the productions of each school that the children will discover the patrimony of the partner cities. The educational teams, thanks to the exchanges of good practices in particular during the transnational meetings, will strengthen their professional skills. These different exchanges will be very efficient to help pupils to succed in their learnings.A major objective of this project is to motivate the pupils and to become real actors of their learnings thanks to the study of \"concrete\" subjects, close to them. To realize the activities of the project, the children will have to mobilize interdisciplinary skills such as language, digital or artistic skills for example. Concrete productions that every pupil can appropriate will contribute to create a group dynamic. It will be very usefull for the pupils starting to learn our langage and will hlep their inclusion. The main topic of the project is particularly adapted to the pupils firstly newcomers : taking time to discover their new place of life, to appropriate it, to take its full citizen place in line with the European Union values.", "http://www.stoliverplunkettprimary.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA219-024070_3"]]}}, "8EL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Seminar Radicalisati-OFF: : Tools and Approaches of Non Formal Education to Prevent Radicalisation of Young People", "Holy Trinity Youth Centre", 16257.0, 10, 10, "The \u201cRadicalisati-OFF: Tools and Approaches of Non Formal Education to Prevent Radicalisation of Young People will take place in Torino between 29th of July and 4th of August involving 23 participants: 3 Italians, 2 Cypriots, 2 Germans, 3 Serbs, 2 Turkish, 2 Greeks, 2 Albanian, 2 Kosovars, 2 Northern Irish and 3 Spanish.\r\n\r\nRadicalisation is characterised by the use of violence towards groups with different personal and social identity and towards the system, if it promotes tolerance, fraternity, the recognition and protection of minorities.\r\n\r\nTherefore, extremism is considered to be: hate speech against migrants, homophobia, neo-Nazi movements, racism, sexism and every kind of violence aiming to deny the existence and dignity of the individual. Violent radicalisation is the denial of every values that are promoted by non formal education. It is destructive for the youngsters and for the whole society because it fosters destructive types of membership, personal development, sociability and activism.

Special attention will be paid to the fact that the competences and the knowledge gained and transmitted during the course remain sustainable and transferable. This will be achieved by setting up enough space and time for reflection and evaluation, by providing expertise, comprehensive documentation, handouts and guidance from the team of trainers.
