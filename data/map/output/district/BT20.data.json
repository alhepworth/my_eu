This has led to a fall in the European SME market share for moulded components during the last 10 years. European SMEs within this segment need to develop more innovative products and manufacturing processes to be competitive in the market. One of the industries using increasing volumes of plastic and composite parts is the aircraft industry.\n\nWe propose to develop a novel manufacturing technology using the benefits of carbon fibre as reinforcement and a high performance thermoplastic as the matrix material utilising the high processing speed of injection moulding. The output of this project will be a new technology for making thermoplastic mouldings reinforced with inserted carbon fibre preforms. This will enable the aircraft industry to enhance functionality and reduce environmental impact through weight saving (replacing denser metal parts) leading to lower fuel consumption. The potential to use thermoplastic components that are easily recyclable provides an additional incentive.\nThe use of injection moulding as a relatively rapid production process will provide up to 30% cost reduction. The project offers European SMEs an opportunity to develop high value manufacturing capabilities that can compete with low labour cost economies.\n\nWe have identified the civil aircraft industry as the primary market for the new technology. We also expect to be able to produce lightweight advanced structural parts for the gas and oil, transport and automotive sectors. We estimate the market opportunity, by penetrating the primary market for the first five years after the project, is equal to \u20ac147M of revenue from sales and licensing of the technology. The initial market strategy will be to concentrate on the EC market, where the consortium has a strong market presence and a clear route to market through the partnership with Airbus.", 300962.0, 1072161.0, 3, 6, "COMPAIR", null, "http://www.denroy.com", null, "fp7_104820_998271427"]]}}, "4TB": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Teaching Problem Solving in Technology Rich Environments", "Bangor Academy and Sixth Form College", 122899.0, 4, 7, "Teaching Problem Solving in Technology Rich Environments\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that many students across Europe struggle with mathematical reasoning and problem solving.  \r\n\r\nThere are 7 partners.  The coordinating partner is from the UK.  There are 3 other UK partners, 1 Irish partner, 1 Finnish partner and 1 Danish partner. \r\n\r\nThis cross sectoral strategic partnership will enable the project team to participate in sustained and supported professional development over a 2 year period.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n- To build the capacity and confidence of teachers in teaching problem-solving in mathematics in a technology rich environment\r\n- To provide opportunities for sustained professional development (initial and continuing) that disseminates the expertise of the partners across the partnership and encourages synergies with organisations in different sectors and different countries\r\n- To increase capacity of each organisation to co-operate at an EU/international level.\r\n\r\nThe project will begin with a literature review to investigate and collate the latest research findings in relation to problem solving in mathematics.  Research will also be undertaken to understand student beliefs about problem solving.  A benchmarking exercise will be conducted to identify teachers' current practice.\r\n\r\nFrom here we shall produce teacher guidance referencing the research.\r\n\r\nWe shall develop 4 training sessions to develop skills in teaching problem solving in  technology rich environments:\r\n1. Problem solving approaches\r\n2. Using Geogebra to enrich problem solving\r\n3. Using technology to present a problem solving activity\r\n4. Using technology to develop problem solving activities.\r\n\r\nThese training sessions will be delivered as 4 Learning, Teaching and Training Activities. across the duration of the project.  This will enable the project team to develop their knowledge, understanding and behaviours and to embed this into their everyday practice.  Other teachers from the host country will be invited to these events - up to a maximum of 30 participants. Using feedback from these activities the training sessions will be modified and guidelines will be produced.  These sessions may then be used by the project team to upskill their colleagues and others.\r\n\r\nAfter the training, the project team will develop resources using a variety of digital technologies that may then be used in their practice and also shared with colleagues and other teachers to encourage their change of behaviour in the classroom.\r\n\r\nA website will be developed to host the guidance document, training sessions and resources.\r\n\r\nWe shall plan and deliver a large international conference to further disseminate the approaches across the partner countries and other European Member States.  We shall target 120 participants with each country in the partnership represented.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the project, participants will have increased knowledge and understanding of teaching problem solving in technology rich environments.  Participants will have greater confidence and competence in their own skills and will have embedded new and innovative approaches to teaching problem solving in their own practice.  These will include: teaching different strategies for solving problems; using technology to present problem solving activities; using technology to develop problem solving activities; and, using Geogebra, when appropriate to promote mathematical reasoning and problem solving skills.\r\nParticipants will also have: increased confidence in leading change within their own organisation; increased knowledge and understanding of education systems, mathematics curricula and sectors across the countries; increased network of European colleagues across sectors; and, increased capacity to collaborate at a European level.", "http://www.bangoracademy.co.uk", "Controlled Schools' Support Council", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036797_1"]]}}, "5AY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Supporting Communities, Encouraging Potential, NI 2018", "North Down YMCA", 103706.0, 10, 20, "This project, Supporting Communities, Encouraging Potential NI 2018, will host 12 long term EVS volunteers on placements in Northern Ireland.
