Sending organization selects students, inform students and parents, makes reservations, assessment forms and evaluation.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the internship, the students spread their newly acquired knowledge and experiences to other students and teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt our school, we want to offer our students an added value in their education. An added value is for example to be able to do some of their practical training in a place other than the home market. Students leave school better prepared for their career and know that there is a larger labor market than in the immediate area. Each student must understand that there are great opportunities for jobs on a flexible labor market if he himself is willing to move. The pupils are also trained to take more  personal responsibility for their career. A boost may be curiosity and excitement in making vocational training abroad. Even those students who don\u00b4t do training abroad are becoming aware of the possibilities by spill-over from those who had been abroad.\r\n\r\nThat our school can interact and share their experiences between vocational programs, strengthen our vocational training courses.\r\n\r\nStudents in vocational programs are extremely positive to take new professional experiences abroad.\r\n\r\nWe can through previous exchanges see big gains for students; professional pride is strengthened, self-confidence improves, English language skills are strengthened and the student will gain knowledge of other cultures, thus increasing understanding of each other's similarities and differences.", "http://www.slcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SE01-KA102-000048_1"]]}}}}
