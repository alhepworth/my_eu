The activity of the center not only reach the town of Montilla but it also has a very important regional dimension, providing a training and educational service to students in the south area of the city of Cordoba. The school is highly prestigious at a local and regional level because of its high rate of labor insertion, this is why our school receives students from other cities.\r\n\r\nThis project is adressed to VET learners that will undertake an internship abroad within their field of study. The purpose of this project is to strengthen the schools' cooperation with European organizations and ensure its sustainability. We also aim to create a framework where there is an exchange of good practice , mutual enrichment , and validation of competences and qualifications , while enhancing the presence and European dimension of our center.\r\n\r\nThere will be 16 ErasmusPro mobilities for students with the following training:\r\nC.F.G.M.

They will improve their linguistic competence and gain experience in a different working environment. \r\nThe expected long term impact and outcomes are:\r\n- To improve our teaching/learning process\r\n- To convey a European dimension and vision to our educational community\r\n- To create closer ties between academic world and labour market\r\n- To get competence and qualifications ackwoledged at a european level.\r\n- To strengthen a europan network enriching partners and the educational activities\r\n- To be aware of our cultural and linguistic diversity.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-047515_1"], [2018, "IES Almunia \"Growing in Europe Ill\"", "DYNAMIC LASER SOLUTIONS", 47429.0, 4, 13, "IES Almunia offers Secondary Education (ESO) where curricular diversification programs are offered, Bachelor in Science and Technology specialization, Medium Cycle of Professional Training of \"Microcomputer Systems and Networks\" and Higher Cycle \"Development of Multiplatform Applications\", And Initial Professional Qualification Program (PCPI) of \"Informatics and communications\". Since 2004 we are ICT and DIG Center and since 2006-07 we are developing the \"SPACE SCHOOL OF PEACE\" project.\r\n\r\nSince 2014 the center has presented mobility projects aimed at students of the Middle Degree to perform the FCT in an EU country. So far all projects are having a very high degree of student satisfaction.\r\nThis project is addressed to 10 students of our center who are studying the medium-level training cycle in \"Microcomputer Systems and Networks\" and \"Commerce\". They are between the ages of 17 and 25. They will carry out an internship in companies in Italy, Ireland and UK.

Major successful space missions under European leadership have placed ESA and its Member States, the European science community at the forefront. To continue this path Europe must have independent and competitive access to space. With the ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) continuing to impede the acquisition of US components, Europe thus needs to develop an assured independent source of propulsion components.  Today space craft propulsion relies heavily on toxic and carcinogenic hydrazines as propellants. Hydrazine itself is widely used as monopropellant and MMH and UDMH is used as bipropellant fuel. These propellants are a threat to people and the environment, and handling these toxic propellants impedes costly safety measurers.   As new ideas and new technologies emerged in the last years, and as the concerns about both the environment and the handling of carcinogenic propellants significantly increase, the so-called Green Propellants show potential improvements with respect to performance and cost. The goal of this project is thus to select the most promising green liquid propellant candidate/s and to push the propulsion technology to the level needed to prove that Green Propellant technology is feasible and competitive. Research and development on Green Propellants and adjacent propulsion technology in Europe is geographically fragmented and insufficiently funded.

The competition is increasing in this area both for the full launching systems and the key subsystems. Cost-effectiveness becomes the main driving factor.\nHYPROGEO ambition is to study a propulsion module based on Hybrid chemical propulsion. Hybrid propulsion is not a new technology but its application to a transfer module or to a re-ignitable upper stage is very innovative. It is an interesting alternative for the GEO transfer, between the chemical propulsion (bi-liquid) and the new trend of Electrical Propulsion (EP).  There are very good synergies and complementarities with the other propulsion activities.\nThe proof of concept (specific impulse, thrust) has been demonstrated. The main technical challenge is the long duration firings. The future development of an operational system, already identified in the current roadmaps, requires advanced R&D work on 4 critical technologies:\n- Combustion chamber.\n- High endurance nozzle.\n- Catalytic injector.\n- Production, storage and use of high concentration hydrogen peroxide.\n\nThese R&D activities structure 4 main work packages. A system study ensures the global vision in coherence with an economic analysis, the identification of technical challenges and the consolidation of scientific results. A last work package performs the dissemination of results.\nAn innovative aspect is the fact that the R&D activities are directly driven by the ecvolution of market needs and system requirements.\nMain expected benefits are:\n- Green and simpler design (compared to bi-liquid).\n- Shorter transfer time and reduced cost of operations (compared to EP)\n\nA TRL 3-4 level is expected at the end of the project.\nThe impact of the project is secured by the composition of the consortium led by Astrium with the main European actors of the hybrid: it contributes to the consolidation of the European industrial supply chain for Hybrid propulsion.\nProject duration is 36 months.", 150248.0, 2414635.0, 7, 17, "HYPROGEO", null, null, null, "h2020_193294_999505461"]]}}}}
