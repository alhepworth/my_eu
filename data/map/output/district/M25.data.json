School development priorities include curriculum development and the development of middle leaders. During an audit of the curriculum it was identified that the MFL language curriculum was not fully developed and this was due to staff and leaders not feeling confident or competent in the target language and requirements of the National Curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe objectives identified for this two year project are as follows:\r\nStaff have:\r\n- Improved confidence, motivation and competence in language delivery across the three primary school phases.\r\n- Improved confidence and competence in supporting colleagues with language acquisition and delivery.\r\n- Greater understanding, knowledge and ability of teaching methods and tools to deliver the languages curriculum.\r\n- Immersion in a culture and language to inspire and empower them as professionals to deliver the curriculum\r\n- Enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\n- Links with professionals from the target language country \r\nPupils are:\r\n- Receiving a quality, exciting, active and inclusive languages curriculum from which they can fulfil their potential and grow in competence and confidence.\r\n- Engage in collaborative projects that will enhance their learning and opportunities and develop their cultural awareness and appreciation.\r\n- Build upon their British and Christian Values to explore European Union Values\r\n- Greater active involvement in an International dimension and with another school.\r\n- Improving opportunities, life chances and employability for disadvantaged pupils.\r\nSchool has:\r\n- The development of a progressive, sustainable and outstanding languages curriculum for pupils aged 3 to 11 years\r\n- The International dimension is clearly embedded throughout the school, with active international links.\r\n- Skilled staff\r\n\r\nSix staff will engage in placements and then apply the skills acquired during the placement and support staff within their phase.\r\nFor the first pairing,the objective will be language acquisition and teaching methods / tools. Immersion in the target language (French) will provide the opportunity for intensive and bespoke language lessons that will enable their competence and confidence to flourish. Building their ability to communicate in French; establishing a bank of high frequency vocabulary and ability to build simple sentences. This will then be transferred to speaking, listening, reading and writing skills in the target language. Cultural immersion will also equip them with the first hand experience to share and develop the cultural aspect of the curriculum. It will promote a deeper understanding of what it is to be French and reflect, compare and contrast with own experiences in Britain.\r\nThe language acquisition and first hand experience will enable the first pairing to launch the language development programme back at school. Sharing the teaching methods and tools acquired and utilising links that are established during the programme. This is an important platform to launch and promote an enthusiasm for language learning with staff and pupils.\r\nThe second pairing will focus upon broadening and further enhancing teaching methods, tools and resources to support cross-curricular teaching and learning. Teaching languages through a book, music, dance, humanities and RE.\r\nThe third pairing will focus upon establishing International links and building collaborative projects; exploring how these can be successfully established, developed and sustained.\r\nStaff have been initially selected to cover the three phases within the school i.e. Early Years and Foundations Stage, Keystage 1 and Keystage 2. Participants will focus upon a two term programme that will involve their professional development during the placement and then applying it to their own practise upon return. Working closely with the MFL Leader they will support curriculum development and planning and lead professional development for other staff within their phase to establish and embed their objectives. Each pairing will provide interim reports to evidence progress form baseline to current position. This will then inform the review of the action plan and priorities for the next phase of the project. Collaborative working is a key element throughout the project to ensure development for staff, middle leaders, the curriculum and most importantly for the pupils. \r\n\r\nThe overarching expected outcome for the project as a whole is to raise the profile and establish language learning across the school: developing and providing a high quality curriculum that complies with the statutory requirements of the National Curriculum and provides opportunities for enrichment and enhancement for all pupils. The longer term benefits for us as a school is to widen our collaborative working with international partners and for our pupils and staff to flourish with these enrichment opportunities and be active, global participants.", "http://www.schoolswire.org/public/stmary003.html.nc", "St Mary's CE Aided Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036220_coordinator"]]}}, "3BL": {"nhs": {"data": [["RXV", "Prestwich Hospital", "nhs_RXV06"]]}}, "3DZ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "RLEF Training and Education Portal", "WALES RUGBY LEAGUE LTD", 338662.0, 19, 22, "Rugby league in Europe continues to grow rapidly. The RLEF is dealing with the fundamental need to ensure its growing network of members is equipped with knowledgeable, competent and qualified staff able to disseminate the sport\u2019s on- and off-field values and techniques at a high level of quality, and ensuring it is administered by robust, democratic and transparent NFs.By far the largest constituency responsible for the sport's sustainable growth are dual career athletes. This project complements previous collaborations between the RLEF and the EU since 2012 and provides a modular training, education and qualification framework, using transnational mobility, mentoring, multi-directional learning and innovative eLearning systems in addition to the dissemination of best practice in sport governance so vital in providing the participating organisations with a solid foundation on which to grow sustainably and efficiently.  Combined, these aspects will serve as the foundation of the European rugby league's dissemination long after expiration of the 36-month term.The Project will disseminate an expanded suite of RLEF technical qualifications to cater to a maturing participant pool; is committed to obtaining recognition of those qualifications on the EQF, which will augment the legitimacy of the education offered; introduces professional actors to broaden the scope and perspectives of the project themes and, for the first time, builds a major eLearning open access portal that approaches course delivery, participation and assessment in a fresh and comprehensive manner, and which will be an ever-richer resource and reference guide for active participants. Ultimately, the trend of increasing rugby league participation and the concurrent benefit to participants' lives will continue to positively affect practitioners long into the future, and we believe the Education Portal will be classified as a model of good practice in grassroots European sport development.", "http://WWW.Walesrugbyleague.co.uk", "RLEF LIMITED", "erasmus_567122-EPP-1-2015-2-UK-SPO-SCP_12"]]}}}}
