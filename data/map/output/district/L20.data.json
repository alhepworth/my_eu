Following a previous work under the Tomorrow\u00b4s Land European project, the consortium aims to build upon the social innovator identity and profile previously defined and empower social innovators as catalysts of change and social entrepreneurs.\r\nSocial innovation has gathered considerable attention in the past years, both in academic and practitioners sectors, as a way to identify and bring about potentially transformative societal change. \u201cActivism in the 21st century seems determined not only to demonstrate against the status quo but also demonstrate how the world could be different\u201d (Social Change and Creative Activism in the 21st Century: The Mirror Effect).\r\n\u201cSocial entrepreneurship\" (Dees, 2001; Peredo & McLean, 2006; Seelos & Mair, 2005; Short et al., 2009) has many different definitions but all concentrate on entrepreneurial action with social intentions (Does Social Innovation Require Social Entrepreneurship? Asceline Groot and Ben Dankbaar, 2014). \u201cA hybrid of government intervention and pure business entrepreneurship, social ventures can address problems that are too narrow in scope to spark legislative activism or to attract private capital\u201d (Osberg, S.; Martin, R.; 2015, Two Keys to Sustainable Social Enterprise, Harvard Business Review).\r\nPrevious work developed by the European Commission, demonstrates that a group of factors impacts the development of social ventures across European countries. Among them one can find the lack of entrepreneurial skills - social enterprises managers and starting entrepreneurs; and a low degree of recognition \u2013 highlighting the need to share good practices and awareness campaigns.\r\nAs social innovation translates to sustainable social entrepreneurship, Unravel Tomorrow will focus on enabling social entrepreneurship to flourish for innovative and inclusive societies. \r\nUnravel Tomorrow follows the implementation of a previous project (Tomorrow's Land) focusing on the mindset of the social innovators. Yet, the consortium identified specific needs for social innovators to excel as activists and entrepreneurs and designed Unravel Tomorrow to capacitate citizens to tackle future challenges through the growth of social ventures. Leveraging on the experience of the previous project and the knowledge and network built during the Tomorrow's Land project, the consortium has clearly identified the need to intervene at a community level, to foster social engagement and activism; and at an individual level to empower social entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThe project is developed by a consortium of 6 organizations from 6 different European countries and combines different organizational profiles - Universities, Businesses and NGO\u00b4s willing to co-develop social entrepreneurship in Europe.\r\nUnravel Tomorrow will include 4 key outputs: the Unravel Tomorrow map, highlighting the key drivers of social entrepreneurship in Europe; the Unravel Tomorrow learning journey (includes experiential workshops and a MOOC to support the development of the future social entrepreneurs); the Unravel Tomorrow Field Guide, a roadmap to inspire future social entrepreneurs and empower educators as change makers and equip them with the knowledge and tools to support the growth of the social entrepreneurs; and, the Unravel Tomorrow Exhibition, an international event to showcase the best practices across Europe and spread the word about the Unravel Tomorrows.\r\n\r\nUnravel Tomorrow will contribute, in particular, to:\r\n\r\n1.

Several factors contribute to the high degree of difficulty that characterizes youth work with migrants. The most prominent factor is the fact that young people from a migrant background are one of the groups most at risk of poverty and social exclusion. According to the European commission EU Youth Report 2015, \u201cThey usually face multiple disadvantages leading to persistent poverty and a marginalized position in society. As the 2012 EU Youth Report pointed out, immigrants often lack the social capital (networks and information) needed for being fully included in society. The situation looks similar when looking at second generation immigrants \u2013 the children of foreign-born. The atrisk-of-poverty rates of immigrant children are the highest in Greece (52.7 %), Spain (46 %)\u201d. Due to their marginalization, either this is drop out, poverty or other situation, young migrants are difficult to be approached in a systematic way through official routes, such as school and other constitutions. The already disadvantaged position of migrants along with the tension produced by the current migrant flows  constitutes necessary the provision of effective reaching out techniques for migrant youth work.OBJECTIVESThe Overall Objective of the project is to improve the techniques to approach and link youth workers to young migrants (refugees, immigrants and asylum seekers) in order to develop innovation addressed to improving  integration processes of young migrants.The specific objectives of this project are a) to equip youth workers with innovative techniques for reaching out to young migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, b) to provide reaching out techniques tailored specifically to the characteristics of young migrants, c) to promote efficient youth work, d) to promote the concept of youth work among migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, e) to promote transnational cooperation among youth working organizations.BENEFICIARIESThe project directly targets youth workers working with young migrants, refugees and asylum seekers which constitute the indirect target groups of the project.

However, due to economic pressure many of these tanks are still in operation beyond their design life, often with little or no engineering justification. It is also not uncommon for plastics tanks to be used for storing chemicals that they were not designed to contain. For these reasons it is important that operators of plastics tanks and vessels inspect them throughout their life. An issue at hand is that there are currently no standards for the in-service inspection of plastics tanks. There is also very limited expertise available on the visual examination of these tanks and virtually no use of non-destructive examination (NDE). Internal inspections are carried out less frequently, if at all, because they are expensive, potentially dangerous to the inspector, and result in a shut-down because the tank has to be emptied.\nThe project will determine the potential failure mechanisms in plastics tanks and storage vessels, and develop ultrasonic NDE procedures, techniques and systems to identify these. An important aim of the project will be to develop an inspection system that is site-rugged and simple to operate. Welded joints representative of those used to fabricate plastics tanks and vessels will be manufactured containing known flaws. These will be inspected and the NDE data analysed to determine the limits of flaw detection. In parallel, the significance of flaw size and quantity will be established in relation to service requirements. This will be achieved by long-term mechanical testing of joints containing known flaws, and comparison with results for welds containing no flaws.\nThe prototype equipment, designed and built for this project, will be assessed under both laboratory and field conditions, and the inspection procedures developed will be submitted to the European Committee for Standardization as the basis for producing a European standard for plastic tank inspection.", 9518.0, 1043117.0, 5, 9, "PolyTank", null, "http://www.hse.gov.uk", null, "fp7_105889_999461811"], [1238544000000, 1343692800000, "DETECTION OF SAFETY CRITICAL CRACKS AND CORROSION IN SHIPS USING NOVEL SENSORS AND SYSTEMS BASED ON ULTRASONIC LINEAR PHASED ARRAY TECHNOLOGY", "Health and Safety Executive", "Structural failure is a major cause of the wreckage of ships, vessels and tankers and causes loss of life and pollution of the seas and coastal waters of Europe as follows: \u00a7In 2004, the total amount of oil and oil products transported by sea reached the two billion-tonne/year mark (more than 40 % of total maritime traffic).

And as highlighted in the recent past, the lack of social inclusion among youth has tragic consequences:  the low turnout of young people in elections, experienced at both the EU and national levels, has for instance played a key role in the Brexit referendum outcome.\r\n\r\nActive citizenship, Political awareness, and Social inclusion are closely intertwined issues in the field of youth: as shown by European data, the older a youngster is when leaving education, the more likely he is to be active in politics and the civil society as a whole. And what goes for educational inequalities is also valid for geographical disparities, ethnical background or other exclusion factors.\r\n\r\nWhile these issues can only be tackled altogether, youngsters with fewer opportunities are still underrepresented in initiatives promoting political participation and political awareness.\r\n\r\nThis is even more striking in the specific case of political simulations, a powerful tool designed to involve youngsters in \u201cmake-believe\u201d politics to teach them how political institutions work while promoting their civic participation. A lot of public and private initiatives offer young people such opportunities, but numerous obstacles make it difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 for youngsters with fewer opportunities to participate: \r\n- Youngsters with fewer opportunities lack information and awareness about such opportunities;\r\n- Most events are designed for students, de facto excluding young people out of higher education;\r\n- Participating fees \u2013 150\u20ac for MEUS (Model European Union Strasbourg), not including travel expenses \u2013 prevent youngsters with financial difficulties to participate;\r\n- The required level of English to take part in such events is systematically too high for youngsters with fewer opportunities.\r\n- The organisation itself of these events, its complexity, and the level of knowledge required to take part, also make them inaccessible for disadvantaged youngsters.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nYourEP will therefore consist of several Transnational Project Meetings and Blended Mobility activities aimed at developing and implementing a political simulation of the European Parliament (EP) specifically designed for youngsters with fewer opportunities, who are particularly underrepresented in such initiatives, even though they can benefit the most from these powerful educational tools.\r\n\r\nTo better suit their needs, the EP simulation method will be designed with the active involvement of 24 youngsters with fewer opportunities from 7 different EU countries . They will be accompanied by experienced youth workers from the partner organisations, while the whole process will be supported by the European expertise of JEF Europe (Young European Federalists). All activities will take place in Brussels, Strasbourg, Stuttgart and in partner countries in 2017 and 2018. \r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe YourEP project will unfold into three phases.\r\n\r\nPhase 1 will be focused on the preparation of the youngsters, thus giving them the relevant skills and knowledge to design a simulation method of the EP specifically adapted to their needs. Online activities and local meetings will empower them to fully engage in a 5-days Blended Mobility meeting in Brussels, where they will get in-depth training on the EU and the European Parliament, and eventually design their very own EP simulation method.\r\n\r\nPhase 2 will afterward prepare and carry out the test of the EP simulation itself. After online preparations, the young participants will gather during a week in Strasbourg to implement the EP simulation they will have developed. During a week, they will act as MEPs to get a real political European experience.\r\n\r\nPhase 3 will then build upon the EP simulation method and its implementation to advocate for more inclusive political simulations in Europe in the future. The YourEP project results will be promoted as living proof that it is possible to organise qualitative political simulations while better representing the youth diversity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\n\r\nThus the young participants will improve transversal skills such as:\r\n- Social, civic, intercultural, interpersonal and communicational competences;\r\n- Leadership and entrepreneurial skills thanks to their active role in the project;\r\n- Improved EU and general political awareness.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the project results will enable the partners to achieve a greater impact in youth formal and non-formal education:\r\n- The EP simulation method specifically designed for youngsters with fewer opportunities will be spread to other youth organisations to help them promoting the Active citizenship of youngsters with fewer opportunities. \r\n- Dissemination will also include advocacy work targeting organisations carrying out such simulations on a regular basis in order to advocate for a better inclusion of disadvantaged youngsters by providing a concrete, successful example.", "http://theinclusionnetwork.uk/", null, "erasmus_2016-3-DE04-KA205-014655_4"], [2017, "Girls Empowerment!", "The Inclusion Network CIC", 16053.0, 2, 2, "Girls and women are vulnerable and gender discrimination is still a relevant topic, even today!.

By organizing different activities during this day with and for other girls,  the groups self esteem will grow on both the individual and the group level. Furthermore they will develop their organizational and foreign communication capabilities.

This because they are closely connected to the empowerment of girls and young women. We will visit the faculty of women at the university of Groningen.  Furthermore the program will zoom in on the history of human- and women-rights, anti-discrimination; historical facts and development. As example, we take closer look at Aletta Jacobs: a local example for woman. Who was she? and what did she mean for the women rights in the Netherlands?  We also will have a creative session about the topic of  anti-discrimination, and the relation to young girls and women. And we will learn  practical tools how to react on discrimination, or how to defend yourself to aggression.\r\n\r\nWe want to inspire the participants. They will learn more about the super women method in witch they will engage during a typical girls night/evening. This method is used in the northern part of Groningen by the local youth-workers to prepare young girls for 'the big angry world'. Volunteers from the girls-club will organize these inspirational evenings. Besides that the participants will visit Fc Groningen. They will visit the new impressive stadium, get in touch with local role-models (football players) and they will also visit the new innovative sports center of FC Groningen were they work with total new methods to develop sports talent.\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands the English group will learn how they will organize this exchange in the rural Dutch setting.
