They are subject to a wide range of manmade pressures, with the result that many associated habitats and species deemed to be of importance at a European level have declined across their natural range.  Yet, compared to other habitat systems, relatively little is known about the ecological dynamics and requirements of rivers and the species that live in them.  This project focused on 7 pSCI rivers in different parts of the UK, totalling around 872 km.  Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera. They also represent a typical cross section of the different land uses, socio-economic users and threats associated with rivers in the UK, and indeed in the rest of Europe.\n\nThis LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. \n\nFirst, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.  Ultimately, the project aimed to develop techniques for addressing key issues associated with river conservation and demonstrate best practice which could then be widely disseminated within the UK and other Member States.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=550", null, "life_153"], [2008, "ISAC 08 - Irfon Special Area of Conservation Project", "Wye and Usk foundation", 1320509.0, 660255.0, "The River Wye has historically been the most productive river in Wales for Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>).

Together with our partners from Wales/GB, Finland and Romania we want to give young people (aged 15-18) the chance to discuss the European crisis and the debate over future progress within the European Union. Central piece of this meeting is how the participating countries view/assess their role within the EU and how they deal with this. The comprehensive role/function of the European Union will, of course, also be an important topic. Furthermore, we will deal with terms (and definitions of those), like 'home country', the EU's motto 'In varietate concordia' and the current political debate over national tendencies/the enforcement of national interests vs. the European idea/attempts to stay united. Together with our partners from Finland, Romania and Wales, we intend to give particularly young people from the participating countries the chance to learn viewing and dealing with situations/questions like these objectively and constructively-critically. With this meeting we hope that they will be able to relate to each other the specific situation within their home countries and start thinking about what they themselves can do to make things better.\r\n\r\nThe word 'home country' or 'Heimat' is a word that does not necessarily exist in other languages. It is a concept that is hard to put in words or describe. It might mean, remembering one's village, where one used to live long time ago. It might mean, finally having found a club or association, where one feels at home, because there are people who share a frame of mind. The exact meaning of 'home country' can be given only by each individual person, but are these ideas/feelings applicable to 'Europe'? Many British citizens have found the answer to be 'No' in 2016. Negotiations about Britain's leaving the EU have begun. However, since then the voices demanding a second referendum have become louder. A recent survey by the British institute YouGov found that 58% of all British participants in the survey think a second referendum should be held. 47% of them even think that 'Brexit' was a mistake. Nevertheless, officially, Great Britain is still on its way out.\r\n\r\nFinland, Romania and Germany do not think about leaving the EU, however, the number of Europe-sceptics are on the rise and have been so for a few years now.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background we would like to discuss:\r\n- What does 'Europe' mean to each individual participant in this meeting?

Young people from Finland, Germany, Romania, Sweden and Wales gather together to talk about the current refuge situation in Europe. The participants are between 15 and 17 years old, who want show that young people are also interested about politics in Europe and want to influence. The aim of this project is to gather information about the current thematic of refugees. See, what is going on in different European countries concerning refugees and to think, what could young people, as well as European Union, do to help refugees. Lots of propaganda against refugees is spred in internet and social media, where young people are active. Young people should learn to read and think critically, and construct  their own opinions, learn to be more open-minded and tolerance. We believe, that refugees should be distributed between the EU countries equally. Each country should take responsibility of the situation according to their capacity. At the moment the southern European countries feel that they are left alone and the east European countries protect theirselves. Dublin 3 - agreement has been dismissed, national interests of the EU member states are becoming more and more the upper hand and the Schengen agreement threatens to fail - all to the detriment of refugees but also to the detriment of the EU. In UK and Wales- the home secretary Theresa May wants to regulate a new law. The immigrants coming from outside of Europe, who want to stay longer than 5 years, should have approximately 35,000 pounds income annually in order to remain in England. In Finland the biggest issue at the moment is sexual harashment of women in public places. New nationalist and populist groups has been founded, like for example \"Soldiers of Odin\", whose members always wear black jackets and who claim to protect the native Finns from the refugees - especially the women. Sweden takes in most of the refugees  in Europe after Germany in relation to their population. The aim is Sweden is to integrate the refurees to the labour market as soon as possible by offering them for example language courses. Thus sweden has started controlling the incomers on the borders. At the same time the problem in Romania is, that nodoby of the refugees want to stay in Romania. The refuge camps are all most empty and  the people want rather to go the central Europe, where the richer European countries are. In Germany the pressure of the current government so high, that it can sooner or later also lead to a failure.  Against this background, we want to broach:- Causes of migration  (unemployment, war, religion, environmental issues, etc.)- What are the positive and the negative aspects of migration.-  Perceive migration as an opportunity- What happens in the project partner countries - which sociopolitical debates are there?- Demonizing Islam? What impacts have been caused by the terrorist attacts in France and Denmark?- How can we promote a democratic development?- Refugee policy is more than just policing, surveillance and border protection ..", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE04-KA105-013634_3"], [2015, "Violencia entre la juventud europea: Situaci\u00f3n y respuesta.", "Powys Youth Group", 14426.0, 5, 5, "CONTEXTMany young Europeans are getting the wrong message about how they have to behave to different faiths, races, sexual orientations and genders.

To Analyze, through team work, what type of social support groups exist in our communities, how these structures work and what kind of requirements are needed to be part of them. We use this information to develop democratic and tolerant values among young people.PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTSThe group consists of 50 boys and girls in equal amounts, and aged between 15 and 17. Some of them come from rural areas,  and this is a great opportunity for them to travel and experience other cultures.ACTIVITIESThe project will be used as a launch platform where young people through non-formal learning (workshops, debates and conferences) develop various skills. (ICT, language skills, artistic skills, etc)., Because we want to encourage young people to become more involved in their community, make them feel proud of their European citizenship and help them transmit the values of a real European democracy. Also, we will meet  political authorities and we will show our concern about it. Finally, we will perform an interactive public event in one of the busiest places in town to convey our concern and our message.METHODOLOGYOnce the project is approved, the project leaders will keep in touch online through Skype or email. As the dates of the meeting et closer, they will specify more issues. The leadership of the workshops will be distributed, and presentations and evenings will materialize. Similarly, through a brainstorming, we will reach a consensus document by all standards. We also, as the host country, will take care of logistics and security measures and transport.During the meeting, the education will be non-formal, with group dynamics, where they develop social and language skills on the theme of the meeting as well as multiculturalism.IMPACTWe hope this project will also have an impact on local communities in the future. The most widespread media in the area will be invited, such as El Diario Vasco, UTB (Local Television Urnieta) AIURRI (weekly and biweekly in the area), BERRITU (a local magazine) SALES BERRIAK (  Salesian school local magazine) and local radios, and thus enhance the international dimension of youth activities.

We believe the representatives and student councils as well as youth parliaments, where they exist,  to be very useful tools for participation and welfare of young people, and to be very good examples of democratic learning in our societies. We hope that once the meeting ends, the young extend what they have learned in other forums with the help of the audiovisual material that we will provide.
