The development of the project will reach the following results:   \uf0a7 The solution for the profitability management of the whey as by-product.  \uf0a7 The diversification of the whey product market avoiding strong whey prices fluctuations. \uf0a7 Production of a new high added value product (lactic acid) at low cost from whey.   The general aim of this proposal is to design a process for the lactic acid production from deproteinized whey. New immobilisation techniques will be applied in fermentation process with near Infrared spectroscopy that will be set as analytical tool to control the process in a quantitative way, at real time. Green chemistry strategies will be used for the simultaneous reaction and extraction of lactic acid in supercritical fluids technology in order to get a whole sustainable and environmental friendly process.   The potential market to produce lactic acid at a low cost with higher purity based on new production technologies will suppose a great increase in the demand and the evolution of new applications.  Lactic acid and its derivatives are widely used in the pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, \u2026.  Recently, in the pharmaceutical filed, there has been an increased interest in lactic acid production, since it can be used as a raw material for production of L(\\)-polylactic acid, a polymer used for manufacturing high cost biomedical implants and environmental-friendly biodegradable plastic.  This project requires the use of advanced facilities and the simultaneous collaboration of experts in biotechnology, supercritical fluids and processes developers. Three RTD performance has been selected to ensure the achievement of these objectives.  At the end of the project relevant information required for the industrial application and exploitation of the solution will be obtained (economic prediction of production cost, chemical process designed)", 129451.0, 1101140.0, 5, 9, "WHETLAC", "http://www.whetlac.cartif.com.es/", null, null, "fp7_96470_998880490"], [1351728000000, 1414713600000, "Natural whey-based disinfection formula: a solution for the sanitizing of whole and fresh-cut fruits and vegetables", "Highland Fine Cheeses Limited", "The purpose of the project WHEYSAN is to provide a solution for two major issues that currently affect to the competitiveness of the participant SMEs: the management of whey and postharvest disinfection of fruits and vegetables (F&V). The whey is the residual liquid fraction that is obtained during the production of cheese. Its raised content of lactose makes it a high contaminant waste which needs to be processed before disposal. Postharvest disinfection of F&V is crucial for extending the market time of the produce, and chlorine is the sanitizer most widely used. However, the likely formation of carcinogenic chlorinated compounds in water has called into question chlorine application, which is already banned in several EU countries.\nWhey and its derivatives have shown promising perspectives as natural preservatives for disinfection of F&V. The project WHEYSAN aims to develop new technologies for the decontamination of whole and fresh-cut F&V and for the processing of whey to achieve a profitable byproduct with sanitizing properties. For this purpose, the whey produced by the dairy SME will be treated under different processing conditions and the efficacy of the whey derivatives as sanitizing agents for F&V will be assessed. The most successful whey derivatives will be fully characterized. Also, a protocol for whey processing will be established to reduce the heterogeneity among the samples.\nIn order to make real the industrial exploitation of the new disinfection strategy, a commercial formula containing the whey derivatives will be developed. Moreover, the laboratory results will be scaled-up and the most efficient conditions for disinfection of whole and fresh-cut F&V will be defined at pilot and industrial scales. Consequently, the project WHEYSAN will provide two major benefits for the participant SMEs: a new source of revenue from the whey-based sanitizing formula, and an increased turnover from the commercialization of chlorine-free F&V in the organic market", 83979.0, 923934.0, 5, 8, "WHEYSAN", "http://www.contactica.es/wheysan/", null, "/docs/results/images/2015/144654.jpg", "fp7_105761_998880490"], [1285891200000, 1356912000000, "A novel system for the treatment of milk based on the combination of ultrasounds and pulsed electric field technologies", "Highland Fine Cheeses Limited", "The EU dairy industry produces 130 billion litres of raw milk each year for consumption and for application in the production of many food, feed and pharma products. Without doubt the quality and safety of milk and milk products is of paramount importance for safeguarding the health and safety of EU consumers. While pasteurisation has resulted in a dramatic decline in milk-borne disease outbreaks, consumption of raw or inadequately pasteurised milk has been associated with several outbreaks of enteric infections with pathogens such as Listeria and Campylobacter. Furthermore, not all consumers want to drink milk that has been pasteurised, and although a niche product, consumer interest in raw milk is growing as many people believe it contains a higher proportion of beneficial microorganisms and vitamins. Raw milk continues to be consumed directly by large numbers of people in rural areas across the EU. There is a need for a technology that will improve the treatment of milk and provide an alternative to pasteurisation. Research carried out by University College Dublin revealed that the treatment of milk with thermosonication (TS) combined with pulsed electric field (PEF) achieved a degree of inactivation of L. innocua comparable with conventional pasteurisation, while substantially reducing the severity of the time/temperature exposure. This project will build on this research and will build a TS and PEF- based pre-competitive prototype system called SmartMILK. It will be tested and validated in milk production facilities. A key innovativion of the SmartMILK project will centre on optimising the combination of TS and PEF, whereby TS can assist the treatment technology in resulting in a lesser degree of thermal damage in the milk, thereby retaining more of the organoleptically and nutritionally favourable characteristics of the fresh product, while potentially achieving similar or superior shelf life to the conventional treatment.", 58512.0, 1287314.0, 5, 13, "SMARTMILK", "http://www.smartmilk.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2013-09/56268.jpg", "fp7_96180_998880490"]]}}, "1EU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "French Immersion Course", "Craighill Primary School", 2038.0, 1, 1, "Our school currently has a 1+2 policy on our School Action Plan and is a key priority of the schools aims.

Two such habitats - bog woodland and residual alluvial forests - have become particularly rare in recent times.  This project took a comprehensive approach towards their conservation by targeting all three of the remaining bog woodland sites in Scotland and two of the three residual alluvial forest sites.\n \nDespite the fact that these five sites are the best examples of these priority habitat types in Scotland, all have experienced interference with the hydrological systems upon which they depend. Bog woodland sites have been drained for agricultural and forestry use whilst land uses within their immediate water catchment have affected the quality of the water coming into the bog.  Residual alluvial forests have been more heavily affected by engineering works to prevent flooding. Also, water use and drainage upstream has altered the water quality and seasonal flooding patterns. On top of that, many areas have been cleared for arable farming and grazing or planted with commercial trees.\n\nThe project, through collaboration between public agencies and land owners, was to encourage the reinstatement of more natural hydrological systems at these sites. Appropriate land management was to be promoted on adjacent areas through the restructuring of surrounding plantation forests and the creation of buffer zones of native woodlands. Exotic shrubs were to be removed or controlled to allow the regeneration of natural communities. Grazing pressure was to be reduced by stock fencing.
