(Three in Spain and three in France). They involve a training course which focuses on the following elements; intensive language learning, intercultural activities, teaching methodology, professional discussion and spending time in a French/Spanish school.\r\n\r\nThere will then be dissemination programme to pass on the knowledge and skills gained to the rest of the staff.\r\n\r\nThrough this project we intend to embed a positive ethos and aspirational culture in our school. We also plan to improve teaching and learning through increasing cross curricular links, embedding internationalism and the European dimension within every subject area, reinforcing Literacy skills through MFL, increasing the amount of spoken language and the use of target language in our MFL classes. We will also increase our use of ICT to support MFL teaching the international dimension, give pupils the opportunity for regular contact with native speakers through eTwinning, increase the amount of whole school cultural events and the profile of MFL within the school community, widen opportunities for international student exchanges and increase parental involvement and links with primary feeder schools.\r\n\r\nWe intend that this improvement in teaching and learning will lead to the engagement of all our pupils, particularly those in vulnerable groups or at risk of early school leaving.\r\n\r\nThis project will also allow us to offer high quality CPD opportunities to our staff, leading to better teaching and higher attainment in school and also strengthening their professional profile.\r\n\r\nThe long-term benefits of this project will include an increase in the uptake of languages in our school, and improvements in pupil's attitude to learning and aspirations, an increase in attainment in Languages, Literacy and across the entire curriculum and the re-engagement of particular groups of pupils, particularly those at risk of early school leaving.", "http://www.failsworthlg.co.uk", "Failsworth School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001986_coordinator"]]}}}}
