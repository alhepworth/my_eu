Abalone species have been considered potential candidate for aquaculture for a long time, and in recent years, abalone aquaculture in other parts of the world has surged ahead.  However, in Europe production has been restricted by the lack of reasonably priced juveniles, technological problems, and legislative issues. The opportunity presented by the FP7 call \u201cResearch for the Benefit of SMEs\u201d provides the partners in SUDEVAB with exactly the right vehicle to develop this young aquaculture sector, by harnessing some of the best shellfish aquaculture research facilities and researchers to solve the significant technological problems facing producers, increasing production and competitiveness.  The core of the research work of SUDEVAB is aimed at solving the main technical problems encountered by abalone growers in Europe in the areas of; pathology, genetics, nutrition, and sustainable culture technology. However, abalone producers also have serious issues which need to be resolved alongside the main research work including; legislation, hygiene and food safety and marketing issues.  These are blended in the research programme to maximise the results, and raise awareness of the project as a whole.  To ensure that SUDEVAB maximises its impact, and for the long term benefit of the sector, the project will finally establish a producers\u2019 organisation that will serve as a network, dissemination point and future collaboration hub for the sector, allowing trans-national development and marketing support to continue.", 226815.0, 1071704.0, 5, 10, "SUDEVAB", null, "http://www.swaga.co.uk", null, "fp7_91858_998295192"]]}}, "8BY": {"cordis": {"data": [[1221436800000, 1315958400000, "Development of automated technology for large scale land based production of lobster juveniles and lobster to market size, including development of robotic feeding and imaging control system", "The Seafood Restaurant (Padstow) Limited", "Strategic Objectives Addressed:  The proposed project is focused on making large scale land based farming of European and American lobster feasible, both financially and practically, by developing automated technology for feeding and monitoring of each lobster individually. European and American lobster are cannibalistic in nature, and are therefore kept in individual housing cells demanding individual handling, which without automated technology has proven to be too labour consuming. The LobsterPlant project will by making large scale farming of lobster a reality, contribute to filling the gap between market demand and market supply of lobster and reduce the need to harvest natural lobster, whose population is already low due to over harvesting. There is currently no competing technology on the market which makes large scale farming of lobster feasible, so the proposing partners are hence creating a new market for themselves.    Abstract:  The demand for European lobster exceeds supply. Current European lobster landings can only supply 2\u20137% of the market demand as the natural stock is simply insufficient to sustain an annual harvest required by the market due to over fishing which has depleted stocks. Large scale aquaculture of lobster is an alternative method to provide the supply to the market, but has not to date been feasible due to lack of automated technology available. The LobsterPlant project will make large scale farming of lobster possible by developing of:  \u2022 automated feeding and imaging technology for feeding and monitoring of the lobsters \u2022 cleaning technology for removal of waste in raceways  \u2022 feed of right stability for the automated feeding technology and \u2022 determine optimal methods for control of water quality in lobster plants", 64811.0, 1192772.0, 7, 11, "LOBSTERPLANT", "http://www.lobsterplantproject.com", "http://www.rickstein.com", null, "fp7_95474_998620724"]]}}}}
