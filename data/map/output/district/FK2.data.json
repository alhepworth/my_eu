In St Margaret's Primary School, we have been developing the French language skills across the school using an Interdisciplinary Learning Approach (IDL). We are also continuing to develop resources to meet the needs of all staff in the teaching and learning of French, Spanish and Gaelic. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there has been little progress in developing Spanish across the cluster due to lack of numbers attending. Although Falkirk Council is on track for the implementation of French (first additional language, F2), plans for implementation of the second additional language (Spanish, L3) are at varying stages. However the Scottish Government's ambition is to expand and improve language learning, by 2021, so that our young people are equipped with the skills and competencies they need in our increasingly globalised world. Through attending the one-week immersion course in Malaga, this would enable me to enhance my own Spanish speaking skills and liaise with my European partners. I hope to achieve and improve upon my methodologies in the delivery of Spanish to pupils, also to obtain the tools and materials, resources and fresh ideas appropriate for the delivery of Spanish at primary level, enhance confidence and competence in Spanish, develop cultural awareness. \r\n\r\nAs a nation we must recognise and promote the numerous benefits that language learning can bring to our learners, benefits which in turn radiate out to our schools, into sustained positive destinations beyond school, and ultimately impacting and benefiting society at large. Following the immersion course, this will allow me to share my experiences with staff members, offer support and guidance to colleagues through team teaching and collegiate visits, share resources at school and cluster level, as well as feeding into Cluster meetings, thus meeting the Scottish Government's aim of introducing and achieving a second additional language by 2021.", "http://www.st-margarets.falkirk.sch.uk/", "St Margaret's Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046739_coordinator"]]}}, "7JS": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Implementation of 'A 1+2 approach to modern languages'", "St. Francis Xavier's RC Primary School", 9766.0, 1, 1, "2 members of the St Francis Xavier's Primary School senior management team, along with 3 members of teaching staff and our nursery's senior early years officer will attend training in language and methodology to embed Spanish into our establishment.

Creating an opportunity for convergence of 2 different cultural approaches (East meeting West) will bring benefits to Europe\u2019s HE curricula.The project idea arose from research findings that approaches which use art/multi-media are having an impact in dementia care. Cognitive stimulation is a recommended evidence based intervention for people with dementia. People with mild-to-moderate dementia should be offered the opportunity to participate in cognitive stimulation activities including informal stimulation through recreational activities and/or more formally via structured programmes which aim to provide stimulating activities based on psychological theories of cognition. It can be carried out by health professionals, carers or relatives in a variety of settings.The project will therefore undertake some comparative research and create new practical and theory teaching materials to teach students in HEIs about how East and Western approaches have different ways of working. The project will also use a range of techniques from digital media and Chinese culture to create stimulating \"memory boxes\" that will be used in health and social care and community settings. Outputs will include a project website, research findings, teaching and learning material and a peer teaching course plan.The project proposes to achieve this through reaching 5 objectives:1. To work with a transnational consortium (Europe and Asia, specifically China) to create new learning resources for HE learners which adopt innovative approaches to care for people suffering with dementia.2. To promote cross cultural learning and better understand how Eastern and Western approaches can converge to create workable practical solutions.3. To develop teachers/trainers competences to ensure they have the necessary knowledge and skills to use the resources with their HE learners.4. To draw on existing research from Europe and Asia to explore a common way forward that meets the changing needs of government health and social care policies and the shift from institutional care to home care from the West, and the growing need for institutional care from the East.5. To lay the foundations for a Capacity Building in Higher Education Project in the pipeline by building a strong strategic partnership to inform this future development.  48 learners and 12 teachers will evaluate resources.

Adjuvant staff, many of whom are ex-Scottish FA education and mobility employees, are now involved in the delivery, assessment and management of circa 250 Modern Apprentices employed by the Scottish professional football clubs who are undertaking the SVQ Level 3 qualification, Achieving Excellence in Sports Performance.\r\n\r\nFor those intent on a career in professional football, the path starts at the age of 16, when clubs offer apprenticeships to their most promising young players. Although aspects of the two-year training programme have changed significantly, the goal remains the same: a professional contract.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statistics are damning. The Premier League and Football League advise that between 60% and 65% of the 700 or so apprentices taken on each year are rejected at 18. Even half of those who do win a full-time contract will not be playing at a professional level by 21 years of age (source: PFA). Effectively, this means that five out of every six players who start an apprenticeship will not be playing football for a living five years later.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation reports published by a number of organisations (Scottish FA, Celtic FC, Aberdeen FC) have unequivocally shown that participation by young apprentice players in a European mobility programme can boost their chances of being offered a professional contract. Celtic and Aberdeen FC have reported that almost 30% of mobility participants subsequently went on to play first team football \u2013 an unprecedented success rate. This recent (2015) club data confirms that European mobility undertaken by apprentice players can profoundly affect their chances of becoming professional footballers. Both of these clubs went on to report that mobility also had a marked effect in boosting employment rates in other industries for those mobility participants who were not offered a professional contract. Consequently, the anticipated  impact of this mobility project will be to significantly increase the skill sets of the mobility participants which will improve their prospects of being offered employment as a professional player on completion of their apprenticeship. Those participants who are not offered a professional contract will benefit from increased employability in alternative career pathways due to the transferable and interpersonal skills acquired as a direct result of their mobility experience.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this mobility project will be to provide a work experience abroad that not only enriches apprentices\u2018 professional and academic lives, but will also promote openness, adaptability and flexibility, and enhance language learning, intercultural skills, self-reliance and self-awareness.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objectives of this project is to use the competencies and life skills acquired through mobility to enhance the future employability of participants, whether that be as a professional football player or an alternative career path.
