In order to do this, there is a need in both regions to develop the skills of teachers to deliver the support required by students when considering their next steps on their career or further education pathway. Sound and informed careers guidance that prepare young people for working not only in their home country but across Europe is vital. The project will seek to develop a working relationship between teachers who are working in technical vocational settings. Using the expertise of Connexions Bucks and Research Guidance Center in Yalova, lessons will be improved to engage disaffected young people and enhance their ability to make informed decisions will be developed in collaboration with teaching staff in both countries. At the same time, the project will have 2 technical vocational insitutions; one  in Yalova which is very established and has national recognition for the work they do. Therefore, it is a great opportunity to bring colleagues together in different contexts but each with a similar challenge of supporting young people moving forward in their future education and work choice. Both educational settings have different areas of expertise and it is the intention of the project for teaching staff to support development of areas that require strengthening in each institution. Students in both countries will be included in the discussions about what they believe in career guidance should focus on from their perspective and feed their views into planned interventions. It is anticipated that once we get feedback from the survey and the professionals in the project,we have had an opportunity to discuss and debate practices in the field of career, guidance and counselling.The professionals involved in the project will develop a suite of lesson plans for use in the classroom and a guidance document for the teachers to go alongside the lessons which will be able to support young people look at their future life choices. We acknowledge that there are some good practices in both regions and to this end we intend to develop case studies of good practices which will be shared with colleagues locally, nationally and at a European level. A virtual learning environment will be set up to support deeper discussions and the sharing of materials and resources between teachers/ educators in both institutions and a website for the purpose of dissemination of the project and resources developed . What we aim to achieve by this project is a consistent method for teaching good career and guidance counselling through the development of a module of work that can be used anywhere in both Bucks and Yalova and ultimately across Europe. It is very important that the decisions a student makes regarding his future are deliberate and purposeful, that the young person would understand that adaptation to the world of business and their emotional well being  depends on the right choice. There is a need in both regions to develop good resources for teachers to use to support the choices that young people have to make when they are considering their future. Both regions are seeing a piecemeal approach to careers advise and guidance and in the UK recent reports have highlighted the lack of knowledge in schools on such matters, therefore young people are leaving school with inconsistent advice and support. The latest government guidance does not address how or what teachers should deliver in the classroom to effect making the right choice in order that students move into the right course of action whether it is pursuing technical qualifications or moving into the world of business via apprenticeships or otherwise.Development of a training event the content of which will be common in both Bucks and Yalova.", "http://www.amersham.ac.uk", "BUCKINGHAMSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024663_4"]]}}, "9JW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Games for Learning and Inclusion", "STONY DEAN SCHOOL", 106560.0, 2, 6, "Games for learning and inclusion (GAMES)\r\nThis project is focused on the assessing and promoting the effective use of games in technology for working with children with special educational needs. This can involve both \r\na) the use of serious games based on gamification as a design approach which leverages, based on expert knowledge and the literature base, understanding about technology design which effectively engages, motivates and guides participants towards learning outcomes based on gamification principles. In relation to children with special needs, the learning outcome can be wider than that considered for typical groups and may relate to social and life skills development as well as to emotional and social aspects. For some children, engaging with a moving object, designed to be visually attractive, on the screen, may constitute a learning outcome related to attention and concentration.\r\nb) the use of existing games or general app technology, not specifically denoted as or designed as serious games, but which nevertheless may be effective for particular groups of children with SEN in developing motivation and engagement as well as, for example fine motor skills. The dividing line between these two types of games for children with special needs is not always that clear and it may not be obvious which category a particular app fits in to. Nevertheless, it is a conceptually useful differentiation. In the GAMES project, we intend to develop innovative pedagogies through the use of games (both digital and non-digital) in order to support and enhance student\u2019s skills and knowledge. GAMES will support teachers who work with two types of target groups of student: students with special educational needs (SEN) as well as students without special needs.\r\n\r\nThe partnership will develop the implementation of games as a pedagogical tool that stimulates learning (both formal and informal) aiming, especially the SEN students, to perform better in formal school settings to be better prepared for the future. \r\n\r\nThe project will develop both teachers and students skills directly through:\r\na) Case studies documenting and sharing experiences of how games are used in formal educational settings with both  target group of students,\r\nb) A teacher guide to support teachers in using games to support the students reaching their educational goals, as well as choosing appropriate games that will support their objective.\r\nThe strategic partnership will also indirectly support the development of teachers skills by creating game design guidelines that will help teachers modify existing games and also give important guidelines to industry professionals, non-profit organisations  and other practitioners using and developing games as a method for supporting students with special educational needs. \r\nThe target group: \r\nTarget group: Teachers (inclusive special needs teachers) \r\nPrimary end-users: Teachers especially of learners with learning difficulties and disabilities (LDD) and special educational needs (SEN) in general, including teachers of young people (13-18) who are disadvantaged, disaffected and marginalised.

About 25 million people suffered from dementia in 2000. As a 4-fold increase of this number is expected by 2050, dementia is one main health issue of the next decades. Alzheimer's disease (AD) covers 60-70% of all dementia cases. No cure for AD exists, and effective and reliable early diagnostic techniques are lacking. Early diagnosis and progress monitoring of AD is a central part of treatment once future drugs and prevention strategies become available. There is a strong indication that different biomarkers provide a reliable and early indication of AD prior to its major clinical signs. However, optimal early diagnosis requires information from a combination of different biomarkers to be used in a clinically useful way.The objective of PredictAD is 1) to find the best combination of biomarkers for AD diagnostics from heterogeneous data (imaging, electrophysiology, molecular level, clinical tests, demographics) and 2) to develop clinically useful tools integrating the optimal biomarker results. Comprehensive biomarker discovery techniques and rigorous statistical models will be developed using the consortium's large databases. The accuracy and usability of models and tool will be clinically evaluated. The cost-effectiveness of heterogeneous data in AD diagnostic procedures will be studied.By reaching its objectives, PredictAD provides an efficient and reliable solution for early AD diagnosis in clinical practice.
