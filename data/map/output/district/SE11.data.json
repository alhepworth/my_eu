At Charlotte Sharman School,  we are seeking to create an international vision, in line with the requirements of the current MFL curriculum, that all Key Stage 2 pupils have access to quality teaching of a modern foreign language. In addition, a growing proportion of our pupils come from Spanish speaking backgrounds and their parents do not have a strong command of English. A further strategic aim is to ensure that all staff working in KS2 will be able to communicate effectively with the parents in the school community to encourage more parental participation in children's learning. \r\n\r\nIn our most recent Ofsted inspection (April 2015), our school achieved 'good'. It was noted that our school has a very multicultural learning environment, seeing evidence of international events to promote understanding of other countries. Senior leaders took this information, alongside the School Improvement Plan (the journey towards 'outstanding') and could see that in order to reach that target of having a fully balanced creative curriculum, we needed to provide a much more in-depth experience of speaking a modern foreign language. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this application is to obtain funding that we need in order to address the modern foreign language curriculum needs identified in our School Improvement Plan. \r\n\r\nWe intend to send 8 staff from Key Stage 2 (years 3,4,5 and 6) to Spain for one week immersion training in both 2019 and 2020. The provider is a longstanding Spanish Language Training Centre (Malaca Instituto) in Malaga that has provided training for staff from other schools in our borough over many years, with clear, measurable results. We believe their courses, which address all aspects of language teaching will raise the confidence and capability of our teaching team to deliver lessons successfully. The courses will incorporate intensive immersion in the culture of the language as well as intensive pure language and language teaching methodology classes, supported by contact with local schools and teachers. \r\n\r\nOur key language teaching staff who will be involved in year 1 of the programme will also be part of year 2, thus building on knowledge and skills acquired. On their return from the week's intensive training in year 1, staff will be appointed 'ambassadors for language' within the school, having half termly INSETS meetings to share good practice and continuously keep the teaching and learning of Spanish at the forefront of the school's agenda. \r\n\r\nProgress will be measured through: lesson observations to assess the development of oral communication, listening skills and reading; book looks to assess the impact of quality teaching on written communication and environment checks to assess the development of the language being a visible part of daily school life. We will also make links with other schools in the local area so that our language teaching skills and expertise can be shared with the wider school community.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the second part of the training in year 2, all collected data will be analysed to ascertain gaps within knowledge so staff know what aspects of subject knowledge and skills to focus on and where further development is still needed. After the second training week new or updated strategies will be disseminated throughout the school to further improve Spanish lessons. It will also be our intention to devise strategies and a framework that will begin our pupil's language learning journey much earlier in KS1. Our staff language ambassadors will provide training for Early Years and KS1 teachers so they can immerse young pupils in the language starting at a much earlier age by giving them the confidence to teach Spanish in an interactive way. \r\n\r\nThe impact and result of this long-term training experience will be that we will have a strong, confident and up-skilled teachers improving the daily learning of languages for all children within the school and eventually in the wider local community.", "http://www.charlottesharman.co.uk", "Charlotte Sharman Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047148_coordinator"]]}}, "5BZ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Language Beyond Borders", "Henry Fawcett Primary School", 50755.0, 5, 5, "The overarching ambition for Language Beyond borders is to deepen our understanding and innovate our practice around English as an Additional Language.

To stride forward with our school vision for our multilingual learners, however, we are eager to develop our  connections with European neighbours and create a sustainable global dimension to our school. \r\n\r\nIn the wake of the recent EU referendum result there has never been a more crucial time for schools, as vital community hubs, to push back against xenophobia, racism and prejudice in all its forms. Our school is committed to nurturing and celebrating the multicultural and multilingual demographic that makes our institution such a vibrant and exciting place to learn. This project will enable us to drive forward  further in our mission to innovate our EAL practice, inextricably tied as this is to our dedication for social justice and the highest quality education for all our pupils, regardless of their cultural and linguistic background. We aim to not only develop good English-speaking learners, but good bi- and multi-lingual learners who can feel safe in knowing their multicultural backgrounds are a wonderful asset which should be allowed to thrive, rather than be perceived as a deficit.  \r\n\r\nThe benefits of European citizenship are clear to all of us in our school and as a school we have a responsibility to provide the best opportunities  in life for our pupils. Once our members of staff become engaged in this project they will be able to transfer this European vision across to our pupils through the development of their teaching practice and increased inter-cultural awareness. This funding will allow us to engender in our pupils a thirst for appreciating and learning from multicultural environments and peoples and ensure that as they continue to grow that they have an open-minded and positive inter-cultural perspective to pass on to future generations. \r\n\r\nThe Henry Fawcett core team will return with a wider inter-cultural approach to providing  the best opportunities for all our pupils to develop their learning after shadowing European colleagues and having the chance to discuss strategies and impact .

Some data on what may be considered Beyond GDP indicators are being collected by official statistics offices, but they appear not to be considered in policy making or are given a peripheral role.\nThe central assumption of the project is that indicators, if effectively embedded in the policy making process, are an effective transmission mechanism to connect research and policy. The aim of the project is therefore to enhance and speed up both the development and the effective use of indicators that can balance the use of GDP so as to support the sustainable development policy process in the EU.\nIdeally, indicator users need to be aware of the knowledge that exists, and vice versa indicator producers need to be aware of the context(s) in which the indicators will be used. Indicators should be developed as part of an interactive process with multiple feedbacks that ensure that user demands are taken up in the production of alternative indicators. Besides this knowledge gap, it needs also to be understood as part of a change process, in which one has to overcome various other barriers that prevent the existing research from being acted on.\nThe BRAINPOoL project approaches this problem as a mismatch between demand and supply and aims to solve this via action research and knowledge brokerage activities.

The prison population is diverse in terms of nationality, ethnicity, languages mastered, age, etc. Although prisoners\u2019 participation and involvement in prison life has been related with diverse positive outcomes such as improvement of skills, self-esteem, self-confidence, and better relationships between prisoners and prison staff, it has been found that there is a lack of knowledge about how to develop, implement and support different types of prisoners\u2019 participation and involvement in prison life, in particular for diverse groups of prisoners (including prisoners awaiting trial, foreign speaking prisoners, illiterate prisoners, etc.). To anticipate this gap, the PAC consortium will undertake several steps. \r\n\r\nFirst, the partnership will develop a state of play in which they indicate good/ learning practices across Europe in which prisoners are seen as active citizens. This state of play will be based on a review of the literature and the results of an online survey. \r\nSecond, the PAC consortium will focus on developing, testing and implementing innovative learning practises to increase prisoners\u2019 participation and involvement in prison life in 5 European countries (i.e., Belgium, Croatia, Italy, The Netherlands, and United Kingdom), based on this state of play. Using process and product evaluations, these innovative learning areas will be scientifically investigated in order to develop a toolkit for professionals to realise new European learning areas. In this toolbox, practical tips and tricks for local and regional institutions for realising learning areas will be given. \r\nFinally, another important part of the PAC project is the strategic influence on local, regional, national and European policy makers in order to facilitate future learning areas in order to increase the participation possibilities and chances of prisoners. Each country will organise a local multiplier event in order to ensure sustainable use of the toolkit and future development of innovative learning areas in which prisoners\u2019 participation and involvement are central. Besides, also a European study day will be organised to spread the results of the project.", "http://www.prisonerseducation.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE02-KA204-034741_2"], [2017, "Edukacja za kratami", "Prisoners' Education Trust", 14897.0, 5, 5, "Education of imprisoned people plays a very important role in their social rehabilitation. This is one of the most important factors that has a real influence on a successful return to the society of such people. \u201eBusola\u201d association was brought into existence to organize various forms of educational activities for people that are set in prison. Thanks to such programmes like \u201eLifelong learning\u201d or Erasmus+ it was possible to create a network of professionals who work in the field of prison education and at the same time it was possible to give the beginning to the cooperation within KA1 action, the effect of which is the present project. \r\n\r\nPeople who work outside prison walls very often have very little insight into how specific and characteristic are conditions of working with inmates and what challenges there are in front of those who deal with people staying in prisons. \r\n\r\n \u201cEducation behind bars\u201d project will enable those who will take part in it, the possibility of broadening their own horizons, exchange of experiences with colleagues working in the same field in different EU countries. We think that thanks to the international cooperation we will be able to inculcate on Polish ground some ideas overseen in other European countries which, in turn, will turn out to be a great supplement (or a brand new undertaking) of an educational offer for prisoners. We want this project to be a contribution to a bigger number of new ideas borrowed from host institutions. Ideas that we want to borrow are all connected with the use of art or sport as the means of social rehabilitation, methods of teaching/learning foreign languages or ICT in the conditions of prison isolation, etc.\r\n\r\nAll those who will take part in the mobilities within the \u201cEducation behind bars\u201d project are members of the association and at the same time they are active educators working in the field of imprisoned people. We hope that thanks to this cooperation all engaged parties will take advantage of it and will acquire new knowledge. Thanks to internationalisation of the project, we believe that we will gain new skills that ultimately will be used while working with inmates. Experience shows that mutual learning/teaching, taking part in training sessions, training conferences and job-shadowing, always prove to be extremely successful, fruitful and inspiring to further activities. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we assume that we will manage to broaden even more the network of people engaged into education of prisoners. This should lead to a bigger number of similar ideas in the future. This is particularly important in the field of prison education, since one can have an impression that this field is highly neglected within the system in our country.", "http://www.prisonerseducation.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PL01-KA104-036024_2"]]}}, "6DS": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "LET THE MUSIC DO THE TALKING", "WALNUT TREE WALK PRIMARY SCHOOL", 20917.0, 2, 2, "This project arises from the needs of two perfectly complementary schools in Europe, in terms of cooperation and exchange of good practices: on the one hand, a primary school in London through the empowerment of musical education in their curriculum and integrating element of students at its center; on the other hand, a music conservatory,  specialist in instrumental musical practice and that is starting a program of English bilingual education. Both schools share  similar  students\u00b4age and teaching staff involved in improving their educational practice.\r\n   Among all our concrete objectives, we can mention: To use music as a meeting place and integration among all participants. To improve communicative English and Spanish Language skills. To work collaboratively between two school centers in all the Project\u00b4s activities. To increase the sense of initiative through musical performance, a story, screenplay, acting and staging. To promote and increase ICTs as level of digital competence among pupils and teachers. To motivate student learning by giving projection out of the study center. To perform an interpretation of quality musical tale staged. To adopt  a more active participation in society and show a more positive attitude towards European project and EU values. To develop new approaches in teaching-learning process to provide more attractive education and training programme. To produce and share sustainable resources due to different activities.\r\n\r\nRegarding target groups to be addressed, they will be involved: At the Conservatory: All  Bilingual English Section -pupils and teachers staff. At the Primary School: All Music Departaments- pupils and teachers\u00b4staff. In pupils\u00b4 visits exhanges, the ones who will participate will be a small representation of 30 children and 8 teachers of the whole group each academic year.\r\n\r\nAs regards to activities , they will be distributed per academic year 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 and they will be constituted by the following phases.\r\nPreliminary Phase: Setting up the partnership.  Establishment  Information and Dissemination Activity Plan. Coordination Activities between both school centers. \r\nPhase 1: Teaching activities at each center: Activities to create the script tale, to create/adapt music, to integrate words and music and to design the stage.\r\nPhase 2: Preparation of visits: Activities for select teacher/s to preparatory visits. Activities to select pupils involved in school exchanges. Activities teachers\u00b4 preparatory visits.\r\nPhase 3: Pupils\u00b4five days visits exchanges in each center. Rehearsals will be performed with all project participants from both nationalities. A final live public performance of the music tale will be played.  Dissemination activities in local press to publish pupils\u00b4exchange.\r\nPhase 4: Assesment of results by teachers and students at the end of each academic year. The whole course of the project will be analized in order to improve for the following academic year. \r\nPhase 5: Evaluation and project closure. At the end of the 24 month duration of the project, realization of the Final Project. Memory and publication of results and resources.\r\n \r\nDuring all project\u00b4s  phases, we will use an eminently active, participatory and communicative methodology of peer learning. The principles of respect, equality and inclusion will be present at all stages of the project. Moreover, all project\u00b4s activities will be focused on creativity, innovation and modernization and improvement of educational practice.\r\n\r\nA short description of the results should be: Tangibles ones: Final Project Report. Script, Scores, DVDs, newsletters, information leaflets, reports, story staging equipment... No tangibles ones: Increased social, cultural, initiative and creative skills, especially in music and language fields.\r\nTalking about impact envisage: Inside school community: a more positive attitude towards the European Project and values.  Improvement of foreign language skills and digital competences. Consideration of music as their future professional vocation and develop their artistic abilities. Greater understanding and responsiveness to social, linguistic and cultural diversity. To enlarge their pedagogical perspective. Optimization the existing organization in teaching departments. To integrate good practices and new methods into daily activities. In communities of the participating centers: Social and cultural enrichment of each locality due to open synergies with different organisations actives. Teachers from both schools will  expand their perspective of music teaching and education in general, future students will take the most of this experience. \r\nWe have the conviction on that this type of projects and exchanges will show our respective governments this is a practical and concrete way to empower music education and, in an ideal setting, encourage them to improve music education through its legislation.
