Reacting to and preventing security threats demands joined-up and collaborative solutions, as no one agency, organisation or government is able to tackle these challenges on their own. Developments such as natural hazards, immigration, radicalisation and growing interdependencies of critical infrastructures have brought home the message that security management has exceeded the local level. Yet, clear conceptualizations, structures and mindsets for a truly European security system are still missing. Our International Security Management Knowledge Alliance (ISM-KA) addresses this issue by creating sustainable and concrete resources and structures to foster international security collaborations. Deliverables will be horizon scanning for security threats/development, an exchange/knowledge platform for public and private security experts and the creation of a multi-disciplinary, sectoral based accredited MSc, and MOOC\u2019s for outreach to the wider public. Guiding principles are multi-stakeholder involvement, evidence-based management, co-creation, international perspective and policy-practice alignment. With this we will establish an international learning, teaching and knowledge-sharing environment, which contributes to the development and professionalization of leadership, innovation and operational proficiency in the field of international safety and security.The consortium consists of partners from higher education, private industry, law enforcement, municipalities, and NGO\u2019s. The partners have extensive expertise in the design and implementation of training programs in the field of international safety and security working with and employing safety and security professionals from the operational to the strategic level. An advisory board consisting of core players in the security arena ensures the quality, practical relevance and wide dissemination of activities.", "http://www.the-eps.org", null, "erasmus_575734-EPP-1-2016-1-NL-EPPKA2-KA_8"]]}}, "3FE": {"cordis": {"data": [[1388534400000, 1493510400000, "FIRE LTE testbeds for open experimentation", "Sirran Engineering Services Ltd", "FIRE initiative targets the creation of a multidisciplinary research platform for investigation and experimental evaluation of innovative ideas in networking and services.At the infrastructure level, such a platform should embrace all major wired and wireless access technologies.FLEX aims at contributing a crucial missing piece in FIRE's infrastructure puzzle:cellular access technologies and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) in particular.LTE 4G cellular networks are gradually being adopted by all major operators in the world and are expected to rule the cellular landscape at least for the current decade. They will also form the starting point for further progress, ushering in the era of 5G mobile networks.The lack of open or at least openly configurable cellular equipment and core network software has limited applied research in this field within the boundaries of vendor and operator R&D groups.In FLEX we will build programmable LTE components as extensions to existing European testbeds, thus providing an open and remotely accessible platform for experimentation with LTE.The deployment of LTE components will take place on three existing and well-established FIRE wireless testbeds, thus reducing the required integration effort, and placing it instead on novel aspects of LTE experimentation-driven research.FLEX's experimentation environment will feature both open source platforms and configurable commercial equipment that span macro-cell, pico-cell and small-cell setups. We will build upon current FIRE testbed management and experiment control tools and extend them to provide support for the new LTE components, and we will develop specialized monitoring tools and methodologies. Focus will be placed on mobility, with the establishment of both real and emulated mobility functionalities on the testbeds.FLEX will organize two open calls, aiming to attract research groups to conduct sophisticated experiments, test innovative usages or provide functional extensions of LTE testbeds", 160493.0, 4109880.0, 14, 31, "FLEX", null, null, null, "fp7_110991_951346901"]]}}, "3JD": {"nhs": {"data": [["RCB", "St Monicas Hospital", "nhs_RCB05"]]}}}}
