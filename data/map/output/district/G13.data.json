This policy  dovetails with the European Union\u2019s strategic recommendation to promote modern languages to young learners.  \r\n         Last session, an intensive staff-training programme was devised to support the introduction of the 1+2 policy. Eight teachers attended an immersion course in France that promoted French language and culture very successfully, benefiting staff, children and the wider school community.   Following discussions during professional review meetings, staff highlighted a need for continued professional learning activities. \r\n         Inspired by the positive feedback from staff who attended the courses, nine staff expressed interest in attending one of the week-long immersion or follow on courses in France.  These teachers are all very experienced practitioners and teach a range of stages from early through middle and upper stages of primary, as well as a secondary colleague. The staff represent a range of experiences, levels of ability and confidence in French language proficiency.\r\n\r\n        The main objectives of the project are two-fold:up-skilling staff through developing knowledge of the pedagogy of languages in the primary sector with opportunities to advance teachers\u2019 own levels of confidence and proficiency in French language skills.  The staff will gain a variety of innovative resources and techniques to enhance the learning, teaching and assessment of French. \r\n         Participation in the course will afford staff opportunities to establish positive and productive partnerships with other colleagues in France in order to develop international themes, share practice and highlight cultural awareness amongst children. The staff attending the courses will develop lead roles as modern language co-ordinators. They will disseminate resources, learning, teaching and assessment strategies and experiences with other colleagues and provide follow-up training support to colleagues.\r\n          The up-skilling of staff through participation in the project will have a direct impact on pupil learning and our goal is to ensure there is a positive and sustained impact on learners\u2019 knowledge, skills and competence in French language and culture.  Making use of a set of benchmarks for modern languages, focused assessment of learners\u2019 French language skills at key milestones will be undertaken to measure the levels of attainment, so that progress can be monitored and tracked through time.\r\n         The second objective of the project is to extend and enrich the school's internationalism strategy.  Specifically, to extend its European dimension through raising intercultural awareness amongst learners and promote the theme of international education in the Curriculum. This will be achieved through collaborative thematic work shared with a partner school in Montpellier. In cooperation with our partner school, we will engage in a broad range of stimulating international activities to share and learn intercultural awareness and skills. Digital literacy will be widely used to develop this area, ensuring enhanced use of the ICT skills of staff and learners.\r\n       A mix of qualitative and quantitative evaluation activities will be undertaken to assess the extent to which the project achieved its objectives.  It is expected that staff who attended the immersion courses will highlight through self and peer assessment positive impact and outcomes of the courses in terms of their own professional learning, and for learners.  This will be confirmed by evidence from classroom teaching observations and capturing the language proficiency levels of pupils through undertaking learning conversations with a sample of learners. The school will formally assess attainment in Primary French at two key milestones: First and Second Levels.  Our aim is for ninety per cent and above of learners to achieve these levels.  \r\n       The internationalism strategy and the promotion of a European dimension will be systematically progressed.  These international activities will be formally recognised and celebrated through achievement of the success criteria in the International Schools Award framework for the Intermediate and Accredited Levels.\r\n       \r\nHaving undertaken this project, the school will be in a stronger position to continue to build the capacity of staff and learners in French language and culture.  This will continue to be a strategic improvement priority for the next two years. Staff will be consulted regularly and a responsive and quality training plan will be devised, designed to continue to extend the linguistic skills of teachers.  Our strategic approach will ensure that French language and culture is embedded fully into practice in a successful, sustainable way for the benefit of staff and learners.", "http://www.jordanhill.glasgow.sch.uk", "Jordanhill School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047114_coordinator"], [2016, "French Language Courses", "Jordanhill School", 14060.0, 1, 1, "The school has high aspirations in relation to the development of two key drivers: the Scottish Government\u2019s 1+2 modern languages policy and the European Union\u2019s strategic recommendation to promote modern languages to young learners.  In responding to these two policy initiatives and progressing the aims in the school\u2019s Primary Department, the development of French Language and Culture as Language 2 is a major priority on the school\u2019s improvement agenda.  Following discussions with staff at annual professional review and development meetings, staff highlighted a need for professional learning activities in two key areas: Firstly, an awareness of the pedagogy of teaching modern languages in the primary sector and secondly, opportunities to advance teachers\u2019 own levels of confidence and competence in French language skills.  An audit of staff competence revealed a range of previous experience in learning French and many staff indicated a need for a refresher course to sharpen spoken language skills in particular given the priority to weave French language structures into everyday classroom practice.Consequently, an intensive staff-training programme was devised taking full recognition of the staff training preferences in order that they were fully equipped to implement the 1+2 policy successfully. An excellent software platform designed to support primary teachers in Scotland was purchased and complemented by training from its author demonstrating teaching methodologies and building staff competence.  This will be achieved through a combination of training opportunities comprising in-service days, collegiate twilight sessions, coaching in context and peer observation of secondary French specialist teachers.  Eight staff have expressed interest in attending one of the week-long immersion courses in French.  This will serve to offer staff an enriched opportunity to progress their own competence in French language skills, meet and share learning techniques and methodologies with other colleagues in Europe.  Participation in the course will afford staff opportunities to establish positive and productive partnerships with other primary colleagues in France/Europe in order to develop international themes, share practice and highlight cultural awareness amongst children and staff.  The staff attending the immersion courses will disseminate resources, teaching strategies and experiences with other colleagues in school with follow up training support and offer peer-teaching observations for others to view the teaching strategies in action.  In addition, these teachers will be involved in a presentation/workshop to parents during a Jordanhill Learning Conference planned for the autumn where school improvement priorities such as the 1+2 policy are being promoted.The school is keen to enhance its curricular work on International themes through links with schools in Europe.   Establishing a link with a French-speaking partner school would be particularly welcome.

This approach of innovative learning of mathematics is a development of the ideas and beliefs of Professor Sugata Mitra of Newcastle University. Sugata Mitra showed by experiment in India that if motivated and suitably led pupils will in effect teach themselves. His 2013 TED talk showed his success and won first prize. During the 2015 British Council eTwinning Conference Sugata Mitra explained his ideas and beliefs by Video Conference and this Project results for that Video Conference. \r\n\r\nSixteen schools will take part in the Project, five in Glasgow, six in Valencia and five in Warsaw.

The common practice is for teachers to stand at the front of the class and teach, then for the pupils to work. The pupils are fed knowledge and understanding and are then asked to use it. This project involves the pupils finding it out by and for themselves by employing critical thinking and using social skills.
