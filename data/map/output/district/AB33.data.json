In session 2013/14 the school roll stands at around 600 pupils. Together with our 13 associated primary schools, Alford Academy serves a community which is spread across approximately 600 square miles. The Faculty of Modern Languages consists of three language teachers, and traditionally the languages taught in the school have been French and German. However in recent years the school has been taking steps to introduce the teaching of Spanish into the Modern Languages curriculum, both in response to interest shown by parents and pupils, and also in recognition of the global importance of this language. This project is a further step towards establishing Spanish, along with French and German, as a core subject within the school's curriculum.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nTo support the participant to gain full registration with the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) as a teacher of Spanish, through completion of the residency requirement.\r\n\r\nTo further develop language learning methodology, cultural knowledge and the linguistic fluency in the Spanish language within the Faculty of Modern Languages, thereby facilitating development and delivery of Spanish courses from beginner through to advanced level.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the school is well-placed to meet the recommendations of the Scottish Government's report \"Language Learning in Scotland: a 1+2 Approach\".\r\n\r\nParticipant: There is one participant, our Faculty Head of Modern Languages, who is already fully qualified as a teacher of French & German, and who has completed, in recent years, a post graduate diploma for teaching Spanish. As a result, this member of staff has been awarded provisional registration as a teacher of Spanish, but is required to complete 13 weeks accredited residency in a Spanish speaking country in order to gain full registration. Four weeks have already been accredited and over the course of this 2 year project, the participant plans to complete a further 5 weeks.\r\n\r\nActivities/Methodology:\r\nThroughout the 5 weeks of residency in Spain, the participant will be actively engaged in developing her language skills, cultural knowledge and pedagogy, through participation in a series of immersive teacher training courses at language schools recognised by the Cervantes Institute. The participant has a full time teaching post at Alford Academy and is undertaking these five weeks of residency during school holidays and fitting around family commitments. For these practical reasons, the five weeks will be split into a 2 week course at the Lacunza School in San Sebastian in 2014, and a further 3 week course in 2015, probably at a Cervantes school in a different part of Spain, to enhance knowledge and understanding of different regions and cultures within this country.\r\n\r\nResults/Impact/Long Term Benefit:\r\nThe main result of this project is that the participant complete the residency required by the GTCS and gain full registration as a teacher of Spanish. The impact and long term benefit for the school will be that the combined portfolio of qualifications held by staff in the Modern Languages Faculty will allow an expanded languages curriculum to be offered to our pupils, who will be able to choose from course options across three major European languages, thereby extending their skill set, increasing intercultural awareness and broadening their horizons as citizens of Europe.", "http://www.alfordacademy.aberdeenshire.sch.uk", "Alford Academy", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000146_coordinator"]]}}, "8TY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Immersion Language Course", "Alford Primary School", 23762.0, 1, 1, "As one of the larger schools in Aberdeenshire, we have an important role to play in continuing to lead the way in the implementation of the Government's 1+2 policy.\r\n\r\nA need has been identified within Alford Primary School for the training/upskilling of both teaching and support staff, with specific focus on the following areas:\r\n \r\n - introducing L2 French within Nursery (preschoolers aged 3-5) and expanding levels of expertise within Early Years\r\n - extending the teaching of MFL into those areas of the curriculum currently delivered by specialist teachers (IT and Science & Technology)\r\n - raising pupils' attainment in both French and Spanish by taking teaching and learning in those languages to a new level\r\n\r\nTo this end, staff have been invited to indicate their interest and demonstrate their commitment to an eighteen-month programme.
