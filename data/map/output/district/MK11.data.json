Mathematical skills  and competencies are essential to lifelong learning and employment.  Motivation, involvement and confidence are key factors in improving learning in mathematics, especially amongst our disadvantaged children.  Teachers need to develop a curriculum and strategies to ensure inclusion and equality of opportunity for all of our children. Creative and cross curricular approaches give teachers the opportunity to inspire children, to create real and meaningful contexts for learning, to provide effective models and images and to facilitate exciting opportunities to practise and embed skills.  It can give them the flexibility to build on children's needs and interests and to ensure attainment for all.  Improving teaching in mathematics will enable us to raise standards and support children to succeed, complete their education and gain employment.Objectives:Share and review pedagogue and approaches to teaching and learning in mathematics with the aim of improving teachers' competenciesDevelop creative and cross curricular approaches to teaching and learning in mathematics to improve children's motivation and attainmentDevelop strategies for teaching that raise the self-esteem and attainment of vulnerable groups of children in order to close the gap in achievementDevelop provision that caters for the needs of all children and ensures full participationCreate outstanding contexts for learning and applying mathematical skills that promote high achievement and a love of mathematics Use new technologies as a tool to enhance teaching, learning and to raise attainment in mathematicsShare teacher learning and ideas widely through eTwinning and bloggingDevelop mutual respect and understanding of each-other\u2019s culturesDevelop staff and pupils' linguistic skillsDevelop communication and collaboration across the school communitiesAll teaching staff in our schools will participate in curriculum development and in shared curricular activities.  These will include all children, with a particular emphasis on vulnerable groups and the disadvantaged.  Representative teachers will attend termly meetings, each school hosting 3 meetings over the course of the project.  During the meetings teachers will share best practice, participate in shared training, observe teaching, share resources. They will also review progress so far and plan what comes next.  eTwinning and a blog will be used to share ideas, record events and developments and promote dialogue with other professionals.  There will be a termly event in schools showcasing the strategies that are being developed.  Events will be shared with parents and the local community through open mornings, library displays and articles in the local press.The termly events will include:A day of mathematics taught through a visit or in the local communityA day of mathematics taught through art and designA day of mathematics outdoorsA Problem Solving DayA day of mathematics taught across other curriculum subjectsA day of mathematics linked to storiesThe Results and ImpactTeachers will develop collaborative approaches to their own learning, reflecting on their practice and learning from each other.They will develop their knowledge and skills to ensure that their teaching of mathematics is good or better.

The aim is to motivate all the teachers to think more globally, to have an international approach in their teaching taking into account that the youngsters of today are Finns, but first and foremost they are Europeans. They should be taught in a way which enables them to think globally and treat everyone in the same way reagardless of the cultural backgrounds. The pupils should be taught in a way they become more independent, more responsible and more tolerant. The teachers need tools in order to be efficient in their work, thus it's necessary they can follow their fellow teachers' work abroad as well as participate in courses abroad. The carefully chosen courses with suitable programmes are an asset to the participants, but in addition the networking and the personal contacts the courses offer as a side-product are of utmost importance to the teachers. They learn as they engage in shared activities and conversations with teachers from other countries. This reflective discourse  and sharing build a platform they can use in improving their teaching skills. All students learn most effectively when they have the opportunity to practise and  transfer new learning.  The same applies with teachers. In their normal teaching environments the teachers are occupied with various tasks, not having enough the time to reflect their ideas and adapt new effective pedagogy. Job shadowing offers a perfect possibility to broaden once's pedagogical skills, e.g.  what strategies to leave out and what new ones to take in use. We also want to export the good practices and skills of our school such as sustainable development, learning through sports and involvement of students. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objectives of job shadowing and participating in courses\r\n\r\n- to motivate new and internationally unexperienced teachers to broaden their views towards a Shared European Identity- meaning offering the possibility to reflect own ideas, get new ideas, obtain new pedagogical aspects and to network with European fellow teachers\r\n\r\n- to disseminate the knowledge and good practices of our school to other schools and vice versa\r\n\r\n- to get new ideas how to use ICT in teaching and to increase the use of ICT in traditional learning and networking situations as well as in nonformal and informal learning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teachers will travel in pairs, in order to facilitate the travelling of the unexperienced and insecure teachers who otherwise wouldn't have the courage to participate in Erasmus+ .  The number of the participants is 12. The participants are both experienced and internationally unexperienced teachers, who are willing to widen their vision of Europe.\r\n\r\n- six teachers participating in courses in Spain, Portugal and Germany\r\n\r\n- six teachers participating in job shadowing in Great Britain, Iceland and Cyprus.\r\n\r\nThe focus on our methodology is learning by job shadowing and participating in courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are going to create a network of European schools, teachers, students and trainers. After this two-year project we will have a long-term cooperation with them with the common interest Towards Shared European Identity.

Facilitate job shadowing so that staff can reflect on the leadership style and skills, assessment methods, teaching and learning methods, inclusion and school organisation of a partner school.  This will promote dialogue.  We will be able to identify differences and similarities of method and approach and come to agreement about best practice and how this can inform our own provision.  \r\n2. Support curriculum activities by embedding and expanding the international dimension of our curriculum and by providing contexts and resources for learning.  This will enable subject leaders to examine practice in partner schools and evaluate how best practice can improve provision here.  Teachers will increase their knowledge of social, linguistic, cultural diversity to inform their teaching.  It will also provide real contexts for learning and audiences for children's talk, writing and ICT skills.   \r\nNumber and profile of participants: 6 teachers will take part in mobilities.  All of the leaders will be new to their leadership roles.  All play a key part in ensuring inclusion and access for all children and for leading the curriculum.  They all contribute to school development planning and school self evaluation.  The teachers demonstrate a commitment to international education within a creative curriculum.  Involvement in mobilities will be linked to leadership targets for new leaders, as part of their annual appraisal.\r\nDescription of activities: We plan to organise 3 mobility activities with pairs of teachers.  They will work together to find out about:  the school system of their mobility country.  They will shadow an equivalent leader and investigate:  the structure, roles and styles of leadership in the school, approaches to pedagogy and how these are managed in their subject / phase, strengths and interesting / innovative approaches in leadership and provision.  Pairs will peer review and evaluate their learning and come to shared agreements.  They will immerse themselves in the language and culture of the partner country.  They will prepare feedback for staff, pupils, parents, governors, liaison schools and the local community.  They will plan one or more objectives, linked to their mobility, into their subject/phase planning.\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project: The project will be a key objective in the school development plan and in subject and phase leader development plans.  Teachers involved will have an appraisal objective linked to their visit evaluation, their feedback to staff, their input into the curriculum, their key issues for action and the impact of their visit on future leadership and provision.  The impact of their learning will be evaluated against the teachers\u2019 standards at the end of the appraisal cycle and will link to future objectives. Outcomes will be evaluated in the school evaluation form and the headteacher's report to governors and will inform future planning.  Staff training time will be used to evaluate and cascade learning and to plan for future developments.

Energy sector businesses (e.g. oil &amp;amp; gas, petrochemical and power generation - civil nuclear and fossil fuel) use processes that operate at high pressure and often high temperature. The engineering components used in such processes include for example, pipes, valves, turbine casings, pump bowls, catalytic crackers/reformers etc, all of which can be made of large section thick materials to withstand the severe pressure/temperature conditions under which they operate. All of these components can be prone to in-service failure resulting from material degradation mechanisms such as metal fatigue, creep and corrosion. Failure of such components could easily be catastrophic in terms of local and district fatalities/injuries and environmental /economic impact. There are approximately 700 refineries, 5000\\ chemical plants, 450 nuclear power stations and in excess of 3000 fossil fuelled power stations around the world. The trend is for the number of these plants to increase as the worlds developing countries will consumes ever increasing amounts of energy.

The industry is therefore continuously aiming for increases in integrated circuit miniaturization, processor speeds and circuit densities. The resultant increasing numbers of ever finer features on the silicon chip, and the need to electrically connect to them has stretched conventional wired or leaded electronics interconnect technology to its limits. This trend of miniaturisation with higher functionality looks set to continue, requiring fundamental advances in device electrical interconnect and mounting technology. Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs) is a key technology that simultaneously addresses the requirements for high density fine feature electrical interconnect and physical attachment of silicon chip devices. BGA is a 2-D array of miniature solder alloy spheres under the silicon chip that provides both electrical connection and mechanical attachment to a mounting socket or circuit board. The small diameter of the solder alloy spheres reduces electrical resistance and capacitance and helps to preserve electrical signal integrity. BGA technology facilitates a reduction in the silicon chip package size, better heat dissipation, and greater module (circuit) densities. Typical mobile phones and laptops contain 3,000 and 6,000 BGAs respectively. These BGAs are inside CPU, RAM, DSP, Memory sticks, Consumer electronic etc. The \u03bcBGAS project aims at wider SME companies who are interested in the development of novel production techniques for producing \u03bcBGAs of less than 150\u03bcm.

From a strict techno-economic aspect, the two CSP technologies which are currently commercially viable are those based on parabolic trough and Linear Fresnel Reflector designs. Parabolic trough concentrators are the most widely deployed type of solar thermal power plant. Most of the existing parabolic trough plants operate up to 400\u00b0C, but with recent technological advances the maximum operating temperature of newly commissioned plants can reach 550\u00b0C. Solar thermal power plants still face several technical problems related to the structural integrity and inspection of critical components such as the absorber tube and piping of the coolant system. It is currently impossible to inspect the absorber tube as it is located inside a glass envelope under vacuum. Moreover a significant proportion of the coolant system is insulated to minimise heat losses and therefore it cannot be inspected unless the insulation has been removed beforehand. One of the highest priorities for the European solar thermal energy industry is the significant improvement of the structural reliability of critical components of CSP plants. This should involve a solid reduction in inspection and maintenance costs mainly associated with unpredicted failures and leaks.\nINTERSOLAR seeks to decrease by a noticeable margin the number of failures associated with the coolant system and absorber tubes of CSP plants resulting in the minimisation of corrective maintenance costs.

Some manufacturers make random checks on single components from batches of component lots. However, components especially the surface mount type are typically supplied on tape reels to assist with component feed for automatic component placement. The manufacturer cannot check all the components. Typically, a check includes visual inspection and in circuit testing. However, performing these checks is disadvantageous for two main reasons. Firstly, the tests can be time consuming and secondly it requires the component to be removed from the packaging or reel invalidating any guarantee to a claim should a counterfeit component be found. Currently, no automatic methods exist to speedily check each single component. In addition the cost of modern X-ray inspection systems prohibits their use for smaller manufacturing concerns. ChipCheck proposal is for the development of a novel X-ray inspection system for fast automated detection of counterfeit PCB components. The aim of such a development is to address the above issues.

The ever growing need for the society to employ more environmentally friendly transportation policies is expected to further underline the economic and societal role of rail transport in achieving sustainable mobility across Europe in the years to follow. Today, the European rail network is continuously getting busier with trains travelling at higher speeds and carrying more passengers and heavier axle loads than ever before. The combination of these factors has put considerable pressure on the existing infrastructure, leading to increased demands in inspection and maintenance of rail assets. Several infrastructure related accidents in the rail industry occur due to rail failure. The continuous increase in train traffic, axle loads and operating speeds means that the catastrophic failure of a rail section may result in severe derailments, such as the one that took place in Hatfield, UK, in 2000, causing loss of life, injuries, severe disruption in the operation of the network, unnecessary costs, and loss of confidence in rail transport by the public.
