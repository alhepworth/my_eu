The European electronics assembly industry faces many issues with achieving high quality joints at the time of manufacture and also once the assemblies are in service. Even if a high quality joint is manufactured it may degrade through a number of mechanisms over time; these negative mechanisms are accelerated by extreme service environments such as elevated and sub-zero temperatures and vibration.\n\nAn estimated 1014 soldered joints are made in Europe each year; the cost of electronic assembly failure to the European Community can be severe resulting in loss of productivity, facilities or even lives.\n\nThe MicroStir project will develop small scale friction stir welding (FSW) for use in electronic connections and encapsulations seeing harsh service environments. FSW has proven to be a high integrity joining technology at a macro scale and has already been scaled down for sub-millimetre joining, termed micro friction stir welding (\u00b5FSW). The MicroStir project will develop tooling, procedures and prototype production assembly equipment in order that industry may take advantage of \u00b5FSW to produce high integrity, stable joints.\n\nUsing the MicroStir project developments European manufacturers and consumer will be able to guarantee electronics assembly performance and avoid the occurrence of defects such as tin whiskers which can disable safety critical equipment without warning.", 71528.0, 1214374.0, 5, 9, "MicroStir", null, "http://www.europlacer.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/149908.jpg", "fp7_100351_965602409"]]}}, "6AF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "RWB goes Europe 2016-2018", "Peter Kent Education Services ltd", 80295.0, 3, 8, "The project \"RWBK goes Europe\" is the second cross-departmental project for the different EU activities of our vocational school. Future educators, nursery nurses, apprentices in the hotel and hospitality trade will travel abroad to improve their intercultural, vocational and language skills. Project aims: The aim is to increase the European mobility of future employees. Things that we have in common and things that are different in the respective countries are the topic of ensuing discussions. Automatically, the foreign language skills, the social competences as well as the personal and vocational skills will improve. Many former participants said that they realized that also their professional skills are  international. There has been a lively exchange of methods and ideas with regard to activities with children in the nursery school which increased the self-confidence of participants as an equal partner for the British colleagues. Number and profile of participants: 80 participants. Of those 22 future educators, 24 nursery nurses, 20 apprentices from the hotel and hospitality sector, 8 teachers of English as a foreign language are scheduled to participate. Activities: Vocational work placements in nursery schools, in restaurants and kitchens and practical training sessions in the colleges of our project partners, as well as immersion courses for our EFL teachers.Project management: many years of experience with similar projects, constant improvements after evaluation and feedback with our partners.Expected results/effects/longterm benefit: Our voacational college will benefit with regard to its profile compared to other schools. The work placement abroad will provide an additional qualification for our students, it will improve language skills, and practical work experience which is an additional asset on the European job market. It also improves the profile of our vocational school and the particiapting partners in the dual apprenticeship sector of hotels and restaurants in our area. Without the Erasmus+ programme many of our students would not be able to gain this work experience abroad.

In total, we will be working in seven countries. We have taken a further step, since Finland and Denmark have both expressed their wish to establish student exchanges with us and include us as partner institutions in their projects.\r\nTeachers from all knowledge areas of our school are involved, beginning with the Headmaster, whose personal involvement ensures us the absolute backing of the school\u2019s board of governors. Likewise, the school\u2019s area coordinators (sociolinguistic, scientific-technological and artistic-musical areas) will also be involved. The participation of the artistic-musical area coordinator, who will be the new school secretary, will mean more direct backing from the board of governors. The training, assessment and innovation coordinator and the school counsellor are also involved. This means that six of the seven members of the school\u2019s Board of Pedagogical Assessment are taking direct part in all phases of this project: analysis of results, needs detection, search for partners, planning activities and development. It is our aim to improve the management of the school, so we must get involved. Therefore, we also count on the participation of the extra school activities coordinator, the multilingualism development plan coordinator, the head of the History and Geography area and five other teachers from different areas with different roles: tutors, teachers for special education needs students and non-linguistic areas teachers. So, this is a major project, regarding the sectors involved and affected.\r\nTo carry out this project we have worked as a team, starting with a calm debate among the members who are already taking part in the project we are now about to finish, and submitting proposals to the teaching staff. Opinion has been requested to families and students and we have also had the advice from Jaen teachers\u2019 center.\r\nWithin this culture of continuous improvement in which we are engaged, we want to get to know other ways to work and deal with everyday problems in the classroom; manage human and material resources; other methodologies that will help us to improve our results and the coexistence climate of all those who work here. We all share concerns and strive to make a better community. \r\nAs we have already seen, we are convinced of the huge opportunity that is presented to us to continue with the internationalization of our school, opening up to other realities and other ways of thinking. Consequently, we can not only enrich our way of being and thinking, but also our students\u2019. This is ultimately the goal we pursue: improving our skills to enhance our daily and therefore raise academic outcomes. A teacher who is more motivated and more competent in their work will be able to better transmit the need to strive for learning and studying.", "http://www.lytchett.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA101-049574_4"], [2016, "Mejora de la gesti\u00f3n y de las competencias profesionales de un centro pluriling\u00fce que atienda a la diversidad", "Lytchett Minster School", 10191.0, 3, 3, "A distinctive feature of the secondary school \"Sierra M\u00e1gina\" in Mancha Real (a small village outside of Ja\u00e9n capital) is the diversity of our students.Despite being close to the capital city, we have students from rural areas,   often isolated, which means few job opportunities for them. Many of these students have a low level in foreign languages, and even a low level in digital competence, which is so important nowadays. We also host students from difficult familiar and social environments, students who are not willing to complete further studies or professional training after compulsory education, and a growing number of students with attention deficit disorder.In order to deal with these students' features, we have taken part in different programmes:1) Multilingualism Development Plan: we were innovators in this programme, since our school was the first one in our province with a French section and today we are one of the two schools in the province with a multilingual section for French and English.2)  Information and Communication Technologies Development Plan. The aim is to help students develop their digital competence. Teachers in our school have created a web page, some educational blogs, youtube channels and we are active in different social networks.3) Teachers' Training Plan: working teams are regularly created aimed at improving our teaching practiceHowever, after an analysis of the academic results from previous years, we observe two negative aspects:1) An increasing number of early drop-outs.2) An increasing number of written warnings for incidents against the school's academic and behavioural rules and standards.After a critical reflection, the teaching staff has created an improvement plan in order to better deal with and motivate our students.This European project was included in the plan with the following objectives:1) To prepare ourselves for the personal, sociolaboral, multicultural and economic changes which are taking place in our new European reality.2) To build a culture of improvement in our education community.3) To get to know about other models and methods to encourage innovation in our institution.4) To encourage coexistence and appreciate multicultural enrichment for taking part in this project.5) To spread the need to share knowledge and a benchmarking culture.This project, which will take two academic years, is organised aroud these activities:1)  In-training service of visiting teachers or \"Job shadowings\" aimed at observing and analysing the teaching tasks and the whole learning and teaching process in our partner institutions.2) Stuctured courses, where the participant teachers will be able to acquire new knowlegde and ideas for their teaching plans, aiming at improving their academic and teaching competence.We hope that this project will have a very positive impact on our teaching practice, as the mobility programmes and courses applied will help teachers experience other methods in real life teaching situations. They will also learn new strategies and resources to promote a more participative and meaningful learning environment. Moreover, they will improve their foreign language competence.We strongly believe that this project will bring important benefits, since better trained and more motivated teachers will bring about positive attitudes in our students towards their own learning.", "http://www.lytchett.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-024646_2"]]}}}}
