Past work by the team has shown that under pressure, professional training and competence per se does not fully protect Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) personnel from the risk of losing Situation Awareness and so making  errors. These errors are due to decision-making tendencies or \"biases\" due to either of two patterns: either \"tunnelling down\" on aspects of the situation and overlooking others, or alternately attempting to deal with too much information at once. The former pattern will cause \"miss\" errors whereby key information may not be taken on board, and the latter  pattern will cause \"false alarms\" where irrelevant or even incorrect information may be used to make decisions. Even with the highest levels of training and skill, individuals can still make such errors. These are due to natural limitations of the human brain  under pressure.  Such tendencies are addressed in training for  many other situations where human decision-making is under pressure (e.g, aircraft , military, medical contexts) but have yet to be noticeably incorporated in VET for Fire services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives: The main objective of the project is to develop an online interactive software tool that enables Fire Service personnel to engage in realistic simulations of fire service operations and receive immediate feedback about their Situation Awareness and type of decision bias (whether they \"tunnel down\" or \"broaden out\") followed by guidance for improvement and self-monitoring of Situation Awareness and bias. This will provide  the  personnel with immediate insights into their own decision-making patterns and tendencies and provide means by which to self-monitor these tendencies under pressure on the actual fireground. The broad objective is to add value to their  training by increasing their awareness of possible decision-making tendencies that could produce errors and cause risk during their fireground operations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants: Participants will be  Fire and Rescue Service personnel from the EU partner FRS centres. This will involve both firefighters and commanders (managers). Optimally 20 people per EU partner centre will be involved in the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities:  The project will involve the following sequence of activities: (1.) initial visit by UK partners to all EU Fire Service partner sites to demonstrate and explain the basic approach and collect information on local requirements for further development  (2)  subsequent development of the tool for each of the EU sites by researchers and then by the UK partners  with a technician to enhance the user-interface; (3.) second visit by UK team to support the initial trials of the tool in each EU partner site ; (4.) ongoing trials to be conducted by EU partners who will then send feedback and outputs to UK teams for coordination and final revision; (5.) refinement of the tool  by the U.K. team;  (6.) EU partners to send representatives to a workshop in UK to review the final version; (7.) uploading the final version to the online site (8.)with  dissemination contiguous with (5) to (7).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology: The  method will involve trials at each of the EU partner sites of interactive computer-based fireground exercises with locally relevant content. A range of exercises will be trialled, but each will present a series of images and video material representing the exercise interspersed with \"probe\" questions to be answered \"true/false\" (eg., \"there was a gas cylinder at the building entrance\").

The project involves 11 partners from BE, DE, FR, IR and the UK who will implement the approach in 5 urban, semi-urban and rural NWE regions.\nEach year at least 34 million t of residual biomass from the management of rural landscapes and urban greens in NWE are wasted. On the other hand, there is a growing market for sustainable and decentralised products such as active coal, used in sewage water technologies to clean water polluted with complex chemical substances or antibiotics.\nRE-DIRECT will make use of the proven technology for Integrated Generation of Solid Fuel and Biogas from Biomass (IFBB) to convert 20 000 t of unused biomass in a circular economy approach into region specific carbon products, among them activated carbon.\nThis will be achieved in the project lifetime by regional and interregional stakeholder communities (biomass waste producers, industries, SMEs, NGOs, researchers and regional interest groups) who explore, develop and manage region-specific product portfolios and create economic value chains in the framework of transferrable \u201cintegrated biomass concepts\u201d.\nThe project will develop one large scale investment for a biochar and activated carbon production at a urban biomass conversion centre in DE and one small conversion plant on farm scale in Wales; creating and securing 20 jobs in direct proximity to the plant and providing additional employment and income generating projects for disadvantaged society groups (unemployed and inhabitants in backward rural areas).\nCapacity building activities will be planned and delivered to support the implementation of the participatory and sustainable development projects and the creation of innovative product an value chains in the project regions and beyond.", 1473897600000, 1568419200000, 151730.0, "nweurope_42_4"]]}}, "9HW": {"esif": {"data": [[1473897600000, 1568419200000, "GFirst LEP ERDF Technical Assistance Project", "Gfirst LEP", "This project will provide appropriate ERDF technical assistance to stakeholders across Gloucestershire through a team based within GFirst LEP and Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust", "ERDF", 163252.0, 326502.0, "erdf_england_455"]]}}}}
