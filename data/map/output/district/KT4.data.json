Italy has an abundance of geothermal energy possibilities, the sources of geothermal energy present in Italy is only exceeded by Iceland in Europe. The South with theinclusion of Tuscany and Lazio are the regions richest in geothermal resources, especially in Campania and Puglia.Different studies have shown that sustainable energy innovation could create up to 200,000 jobsin the renewableenergysector(with the development of new professionsrelated to so-called green skills) whichwould rise to more than 600.000 when we consider those involved in building and regenerating buildings (Legambiente). These are not random numbersplucked from the sky, in Germany for example400,000 people area already employed in renewable energy thanks to a favorable policy development and incentives for working towards energy efficiency.Italy could follow this example and not only benefit in terms of having control of their own energy but also creating jobs in the process and laying the foundations for a long standing and successful industry.Starting from this analysis, the idea of the project Earth Core is born, as an opportunity for new technical high school graduates to receive a training in the renewable energy sector in a European context that will allow them to be competitive in a world more and more competitive and where in the face of such many business challenges, the most powerful weapon available to operators in this sector is a formation pointing to the quality and innovation that focuses on environmental compliance.As a general objective, Earth Core aims to create qualified professionals able to import and contextualize the good practices in the field of renewable energy, especially in geothermal energy, on their territory. It promotes the birth of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship in the field, launching at the same time awareness activities in this regard, by promoting geothermal energy as a clean and free renewable source.Specific objectives:- Adressed to 100 new high school graduates from technical institutes in the fields of mechanics, mechatronics and energy; electronics and electrical engineering; construction, environment and territory and it aims at a training that will help them developing new skills and providing them with greater expertise in the field of geothermal energy source and more generally of renewable energy sources;- It aims to provide an educational experience that is relevant to the labor market;- It aims to address the problem of low education of young high school graduates, that is one of the causes of youth unemployment and the need for a stronger link between vocational training, employment and entrepreneurship.

Let\u2019s admit the fact that we immediately feel sorry for the person the word is being used in reference to.  What we visualise is probably someone in a wheelchair or someone who is mentally disabled and is not capable of carrying out routine tasks properly. Disability is an impairment of the mind or body that prevents a person to function in one of more major life activities. Disability affects 15-20% of every country's population: There are at least 650 million people with disabilities worldwide. The United Kingdom has the second highest prevalence of disability with 27.2% of the population having a long-standing health problem or disability.\r\nConsiderable international evidence supports that students with a disability are bullied and harassed by other students without a disability, with students with learning disabilities more highly represented as victims. Bullying and harassment may come in the form of teasing, physical aggression, spreading rumours, social exclusion, taking belongings, imitating and being made fun of.\r\nAttending special classes, requiring extra help, being seen to be different, being treated differently by teachers or having a lack of social awareness can increase the risk of being bullied and harassment. Bullying is a problem of international significance for all students. Its impacts can include decreased academic performance, absenteeism, anxiety, depression, poor esteem, impaired concentration, self-harm and early school leaving as well.\r\nAs the applicant organisation having in mind the facts we mentioned we decided to prepare this project with 6 partners to become organisations that foster positive attitudes towards disabled people. There are many small actions that we can all take to include people with disability in our community. Over time, many small actions undertaken by lots of people will lead to a more welcoming and inclusive community for people with disability.  Our project: ''The Change Starts with us\u2019\u2019 intends to equip young people with the knowledge, skills and confidence to take personal and collective action to enhance the inclusion of people with disability in community life.\r\nThe project is prepared to help children better understand what it means and how it feels to be a young person with a disability and gives students the opportunity to learn what is involved when someone has a disability and how they have to adapt, go to school, or work as independently as possible.\r\nThe main objectives of the project are:\r\n- To encourage children to accept their peers with disabilities as people first and also to find ways to include everyone in school and after-school activities.\r\n-Increase the awareness and understanding of young people with disability issues and people with a disability living in their local communities.\r\n-Encourage schools to embrace disability awareness and inclusion as part of their core curriculum.\r\nThe project will help to bridge the gap between children with and without disabilities and decrease the number of disabled early school leavers.\r\n-Improve the language and ICT skills of the participants \r\n-Combat discrimination, segregation, racism, bullying and violence; \r\n-Enhance participation and learning performance of disadvantaged learners, reducing disparities in learning outcomes\r\n-Strengthening the international cooperation through sharing good teaching and learning practices \r\n-To prepare and deploy the education and training of professionals for equity, diversity and inclusion challenges in the learning environment \r\n- To encourage active citizenship and entrepreneurship, jointly carried out by 2 or more groups of young people from different countries\r\n-To facilitate the recognition and validation of knowledge, skills and competencies acquired through formal, non-formal and informal learning.\r\nAnother aim of our project is to highlight the role of NGOs, schools as catalysts for change by offering the students and community the opportunity of getting positive and favourable experience in learning. Our responsibility is not only emphasising the teaching and learning process but also doing our best on aspects like teamwork, socio-emotional development, respect and human rights.

On the other hand, our female volunteer trainers have not the necessary competencies with the everyday use of ICT but they can share their life experiences as active citizens and transfer some of their non-formal pedagogic tools. \r\nIn order to close this gap, we want to cooperate on a European level with these trainers in adult education, senior volunteers and their learners to exchange good practices from each other. This intergenerational learning setting will help young unemployed women to valorize their competences, develop basic skills and knowledge about active citizenship and rights with the support of senior women and the autobiographical methods that they will apply. The young women will help senior women to get better access to modern technologies.\r\n\r\nThe idea for the project is based on the results of a successfully completed Grundtvig project. Within this project \u201cAmbassadors of active citizenship\u201d, the so-called \u201cGiovanna\u2019s\u201d have been formed on the autobiographical method. These senior women, all actively engaged in civil society and local NGO\u2019s have discovered and learned to use the different tools of the autobiographical method in order to help other women to valorize their informal competencies. After the end of this project all participants felt a strong need to continue using this method and even use it in a larger sense by working on a follow-up project now including young female women.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur main objectives will be to: \r\n- Valorize civic competences of young NEET and migration women\r\n- Increase awareness of the fundamental rights, means of social prevention and active citizenship among young women\r\n- Exchange of best practices between trainers in non-formal education for adults (autobiographical method, valorization of basic competencies)\r\n- Reduce the intergenerational and gender gaps in ICT competencies\r\n- Increase awareness of the importance of digital inclusion\r\n\r\nOur target group of this project will be: \r\n- European young unemployed adult women (NEETs and Migrants)\r\n- European Adult Trainers in non-formal education; senior women involved in local NGO\r\n\r\nThe problem of low basic and civic competencies among adults is not just a national but certainly European problem. For us it is an evidence to treat this problem therefore even so on a European level. The idea is to exchange the best practices in non-formal education and to use the best and improved methods on a national level in each involved partner country.\r\n\r\nThree transnational meetings between project coordinators and trainers of the different organizations will be organized during the 2 years project in order to identify and share good practices on intergenerational learning and non-formal methods, especially including ICT. After each meeting, training courses on a national level will be organized in order to stimulate the intergenerational learning between women and to test and develop the shared learning tools. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the project the 30 adult learners, trainers and volunteers will have the chance to meet and exchange during a training course. Working sessions about \u201cWomen in today\u2019s European societies\u201d will be organized which enable the women to exchange and debate about differences and similarities within their countries and to meet with local NGOs engaged in female rights. \r\n\r\nThe adult learner will improve their basic competences and develop a greater awareness of their skills and opportunities they have in society and that it is up to them to make a change. The project is about the valorization of each woman no matter of her age or social or cultural background. Trainers and volunteers will gain expert knowledge in non-formal learning and improved ability to apply these in their daily work through the exchange of best practices. With this strategic partnership, we want to enable non-formal trainers to work together, to exchange their learning approaches, enable women to meet and learn beyond national borders by working together on a European level.", "http://hanta-associates.h-org.com", "HANTA ASSOCIATES LIMITED", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA204-047959_coordinator"], [2017, "Europe for You", "Hanta Associates Ltd", 45890.0, 2, 3, "CONTEXT: \r\n\r\nVET mobility project for trainning of students in companies in the UE.  \r\nConsortium: three institutions located in the Region of Murcia (Spain)\r\nLeading/coodinator center: CIFP Carlos III\r\nSending institutions: IES Aljada  e IES Ram\u00f3n y Cajal\r\nPeriod: 24 moths\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS NUMBER AND PROFILE:\r\n12 students belonging to the following academic fields: Business Administration, Trade and Marketing,  TIC's, Personal Image, Image and Sound, Vehicles Electromecanics, Telecommunication Installations, and Health.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJETIVES/GOALS:\r\nTo offer VET students the chance to do an internship in companies in the European Union in order to develop new  competencies, professional, personal, and language related.

The training course will target unemployed young people from all over Europe and neighbouring countries and will enhance their skills regarding social entrepreneurship as a means to transit to labour market and solve social problems. \r\nObserving the region of Europe, two major problems are encountered among youth\u2019s society; on one hand there is a high rate of educated but unemployed youth and on the other hand social exclusion, discrimination and lack of access to human rights threatens society and especially vulnerable groups. \r\n\r\nThe proposed training course intends to combine these two problems and transform them into the solution: social entrepreneurship. A social entrepreneur is a person who identifies or recognizes a social problem and uses entrepreneurial principles to organize, create, and manage a social venture to achieve a desired social change. According to Dees  social entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs with a social mission, which for them is very explicit and central. By generating social entrepreneurs, youth will accomplish simultaneously; their own transition from education to labour market and at the same time, a social change which will improve their own, but also others\u2019 youth access to human rights, social inclusion and respect. \r\nFor this reasons, the aim of the activity is to develop participants\u2019 social entrepreneurship skills, targeting thus a long term and sustainable impact on local societies of Europe. After the training course, participants are expected to act as social entrepreneurs, supporting their own autonomy and the society in general. \r\n\r\nThe training course will cover the thematic of youth unemployment, social exclusion and social entrepreneurship. Particularly, it will engage participants to reflect on the current situation regarding youth unemployment in Europe and invite them to conceptualize social exclusion, discrimination and xenophobia, especially when combined with unemployment. Most importantly, the training course will challenge participants\u2019 creativity, empower them and develop their social entrepreneurship skills.\r\nThe aim of the project is to develop participants\u2019 social entrepreneurship skills which will be used as a means to support their autonomy and transition to the labour market. At the same time, because of the social character of this particular entrepreneurship they will target social change for a more inclusive world, sustainability and access to human rights. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, the  objectives of the training course are:\r\nTo explore current situation regarding unemployment and social exclusion and the link between them\r\nTo work with the social entrepreneurship principles\r\nTo learn how the Erasmus+ Programme can support youth activities;\r\nTo increase entrepreneurial skills especially social entrepreneurial skills for youth and pertinent contribution to enhancing entrepreneurial skills, development of economic equity, equality of chances, removing barriers to the labour market and discrimination. \r\nTo promote participatory process for youth in the labour market and amend their economic and social condition to better.\r\nTo raise awareness about the need for a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth to the wider public;\r\n\r\nBy the end of the training, participants are expected to have their own strategic plan as social entrepreneurs.

Also, participants will gather and organize all information they find useful in the guide \u201cSteps towards social entrepreneurship\u201d. The guide will be disseminated to other NGOs.\r\nDuring the 7-days training course, the project team will use non formal education methods to achieve the 3 concrete objectives and the aim stated in the previous section. Trainers will engage participants to link the problems of youth unemployment and social exclusion through interactive activities. They will encourage participants to transform these problems into a solution, going through the social entrepreneurship principals with experiential methods.

Currently, many targets for CVD treatment have been selected based on mechanism of action and inference of functions in cellular models to clinical systems, and lack the rigorous clinical validation needed to maximize the chance for successful clinical drug development. Consequently, new drugs that modulate the activity of such targets fail later in clinical development by lack of efficacy or induction of safety liabilities due to off-target effects. To increase the success rate for clinical development of novel therapies in CVD, we will follow an innovative approach by using: 1. Independent and large-scale population studies from which novel targets with strong correlation to clinical phenotypes are deduced; 2.

High quality human biobanks to confirm the molecular relevance of targets in diseased cardiovascular tissues; 4.
