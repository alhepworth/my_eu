The sector is growing rapidly and needs to keep and grow the staff it can get.  Catering Mobility in Europe will create a set of ambassadors in the sector who are students, apprentices, graduates within a year or staff doing vocational qualifications. They will have the will to take a leap out of their comfort zones and see a new side of the hospitality sector that will propel them forwards in their careers. This leap will have at its heart a 5 week mobility in Amsterdam (2 people), Tenerife (2 people), Gothenburg (1) or Helsinki (1) to first gain cultural and local food knowledge alongside further language lessons over 4 weeks at hotel and restaurant schools and then do a four month placement in a 4 or 5 star hotel from October to February, including over the busy holiday season.  The learning they gain will fit with their qualifications and will cover soft skills, cultural awareness and adaptablilty, and kitchen and cooking experience specfiic to the host country.  The participants will be part of the Consortium of Hospitality and Accommodation Schools in Europe (CHASE) network's well-established model of learning and will share their experience with fellow learners from several other CHASE partners' countries. This will give them learning support and connections with young people from many European countries, in addition to the host country and establish them as citizens of Europe.While the participants are learning and working, they will be writing blogs and social media posts about their experiences and insights which will be shared around the Hospitality Industry Trust Scotland's wide membership of hospitality employers, as well as Glasgow Restaurant Association members and many other networks for people working in hospitality.   While writing these blogs on cultural differences, local seasonings and the links to culture, recipes and the tourism sights, they will be acting as ambassadors for Scotland to their host countries and sharing their experiences with the sector back home, taking a step up in their career ambitions.While the participants are gaining passion for the hospitality and sharing it widely with their new discoveries, the consortium partners in Scotland will be learning about catering mobilities and making contacts in other countries.  Light on the Path are well established hosts of shorter European placements and sending unemployed people on placements, Catering Mobility in Europe will give them experience of hospitality and longer placements, while establishing many new partnerships. HIT Scotland offers scholarships and bursaries for local and international short courses outside the EU but this will be new for them and give them new contacts and insights, as well as getting to work closely with the participants. Marriott Hotels is very active in staff development but has not been able to offer international placements to the EU for its developing staff and this will allow them to boost their connections and gain extra-passionate staff to inspire others and provide excellent services. Receiving partners in each country will get to know Scottish students and partners be able to send their own students to Scotland with their own projects.The project's participants will feed their experience into a flow of news while they are away, inspiring people working in the sector and thinking about working in the sector.  When they return, they will help to plan and deliver a dissemination event to high-level leaders in the hospitality sector, students and colleges, so that their excitement and discoveries can be spread.  The consortium partners and their networks will also promote the opportunity for the participants to do outreach visits on their return to inspire more people and share their stories.The end of the project aims to be the beginning of a long series of opportunities for more people in the sector to gain an international outlook on hospitality and their careers, to inspire others and to grow in their careers - both in Scotland and potentially elsewhere in Europe.

There are around different definitions about inclusion, from where many of them are also used in youth work and in defining aims and objectives of projects under Erasmus+, without putting much thought in the concept of inclusion. But inclusion should not be an option, but a must in youth work. Together with our colleagues, we have been discussing the inclusion model of European Commission and how youth workers or youth leaders are practicing \u201cinclusion in reality\u201d and have come to conclusion, that from one side there is luck of understanding what \u201cinclusion\u201d (for us those questions have raised: include from where, into what and including whom?) means and also youth workers luck of practical skills and support, how to implement the concept into reality to make their work more inclusive.

We have recognized some problems concerning employers and students from vocational schools. Employers search employees who, except of knowledge, have the practical skills. The present system does not offer the employers a possibility to verify the employees\u2019 skills. Youth have got some problems with having vocational practices and recognition of their vocational competences, which were gained during extracurricular education. Moreover, during the past few years, there has been a significant increase of employers\u2019 expectations of soft (social) competences which are not taught (almost at all) in vocational schools. According to our research, which have been made during the innovation project POKL, 1/3 employers declared that vocational knowledge and skills could be easily caught up (and those kinds of workshops are financed by employers for employees). Unfortunately, youth that come to work do not have skills to work in teams and to solve the problems. What\u2019s more, they even create unnecessary problems to themselves. Additionally, youth are not creative, open-minded to new challenges and they do have some problems with social communication. At the same time, there is more youth who graduate from high schools and universities and they also go to the vocational trainings that give them national certificates, for example lifeguard, paramedic, youth worker etc. Many of vocational courses like: basics of finances, logistics, coaching, human resources management \u2013 are not considered as important by the educational system.\r\n\r\nTo meet those needs our partnership is planning to establish a project that supports educational system and vocational education by creating a model of 5 integrated tools which are:\r\n- System of vocational competences cards  (EURO26 Card with chip with additional functionality \u2013 collecting points for internships, courses, practices and other forms of vocational and personal development) with a software servicing the cards\r\n- System of vocational competences certification (gained from formal and extracurricular education) together with the software servicing this certification\r\n-  Strategy of combining transversal partnership (which cooperate with the systems mentioned above and are responsible for implementation).\r\n\r\nAbout 18-22participants from our organizations will cooperate with the project.

The MOBILITIES project seeks to improve retention, achievement and attitude and give participants a greater understanding and knowledge of their vocational area from an EU perspective. It will also give them with the opportunity to enhance their vocational learning within an EU work placement that will add value to their development by integrating invaluable soft and employability skills, language development and cultural awareness that will significantly enhance their potential to enter the labour market\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe North Lanarkshire region experiences high unemployment and significant levels of deprivation and many of the students who enrol at the College have come with little or no qualifications. The MOBILITIES project will support 276 VET participants, 51 accompanying adults and 5 staff training assignments across the three campuses and will target individuals who face multiple, complex barriers to entering the labour market such as a lack of qualifications, low self-esteem, lacking confidence and motivation and have little or no employability skills.

The Association is responsible for developing, promoting and fostering international and domestic rugby within Scotland. Our aims have always remained true to developing and promoting rugby for all in Scotland. \r\nCoach education is one of the most important duties of the SRU. Improvement of coaching skills through European interaction and exchange of innovation, coupled with enhanced employability for all mobility participants is central to this Erasmus+ application under Key Action 1.\r\n\r\nSport represents a large and fast-growing sector of the economy and makes an important contribution to growth and jobs, with value added and employment effects exceeding average growth rates. Around 2% of global GDP is generated by the sport sector.7 Major sport events and competitions provide strong potential for increased development of tourism in Europe. Sport is thus a contributor to the Europe 2020 strategy.\r\n\r\nThis Erasmus+ application is a relatively large project and will involve mobility for 76 coaching staff who are involved in VET delivery at various levels within the industry, ranging from UKCC level 1 to 3. Participants will be drawn from four categories of VET delivery:\r\n1. Coaches employed by the SRU member clubs or within the Performance Department or the regional Academies. These VET staff are employed on a full-time basis at a variety of levels, from schools rugby to elite youth development coaching. Mobility will enhance personal skills via exposure to innovative EU coaching skills in France.\r\n2. Female coaches involved in women\u2019s rugby who are actively involved in the promotion of female participation in Scottish rugby and developing young elite girls and women in the sport who will travel to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives are summarised below:\r\n1. To provide participants with access to a European centre of excellence and to allow them to acquire the skills involved in the theory, practice and delivery of the most advanced coaching technologies and processes available in Europe.\r\n2. To enhance employability of all participants through the acquisition of additional soft skills, coaching competences and qualifications as a direct result of undertaking European mobility.\r\n3. To improve career progression for mobility participants as a direct result of the innovative skills and competences acquired during the mobility.\r\n4. To monitor career progression among mobility participants and compare the data with statistics obtained from coaching personnel who have not participated in European mobility.\r\n5. To improve the skills and knowledge base of coaches in Women\u2019s rugby and increase participation and retention rates to levels comparable with European countries such as Spain.\r\n\r\nThe tangible outcomes will alow the community, grassroots and professional club participant coaches to establish clear pathways for career progression through the enhanced programmes for player development which will be implemented as a result of mobility. European innovations and methods will be introduced to provide more transparent links between Scottish Regional Academies, professional senior clubs and community & grassroots coaches. This area of talent development is where our more successful European partner nations have a greater comparative competitive edge over Scotland. In short, this mobility project will allow the mobility participants to work with the SRU in establishing a more robust \u201cNational Talent Development Audit\u201d involving  community and grassroots clubs, the regional academies and the professional clubs and other key institutions in the youth development process.\r\n\r\nOne of the key aspirations of this project is to use the mobility work placements to bring together ideas and innovation, to identify and develop elite players and improve talent development within Scotland through a clear and identifiable route through the schools, community and grassroots coaching frameworks. Study and assessment of European methods of measuring performance levels, and the treatment and development of talented players before the age of 16 will be crucial. This is leading to a new mind set within the highest levels of the game, which accepts and endorses this approach.\r\n\r\nWork programmes for women\u2019s rugby coaches will place a strong emphasis on studying how young talented female players are identified at the earliest opportunity and how that talent is supported and sustained through the community and grassroots infrastructure in the European partner countries. These studies will be crucial to the employability of the participant coaches but will also be pivotal in increasing participation rates in women\u2019s rugby in Scotland. These mobility outcomes will have a significant impact on the restructuring of the SRU regional talent identification programmes in women\u2019s rugby.

This project complements previous collaborations between the RLEF and the EU since 2012 and provides a modular training, education and qualification framework, using transnational mobility, mentoring, multi-directional learning and innovative eLearning systems in addition to the dissemination of best practice in sport governance so vital in providing the participating organisations with a solid foundation on which to grow sustainably and efficiently.  Combined, these aspects will serve as the foundation of the European rugby league's dissemination long after expiration of the 36-month term.The Project will disseminate an expanded suite of RLEF technical qualifications to cater to a maturing participant pool; is committed to obtaining recognition of those qualifications on the EQF, which will augment the legitimacy of the education offered; introduces professional actors to broaden the scope and perspectives of the project themes and, for the first time, builds a major eLearning open access portal that approaches course delivery, participation and assessment in a fresh and comprehensive manner, and which will be an ever-richer resource and reference guide for active participants. Ultimately, the trend of increasing rugby league participation and the concurrent benefit to participants' lives will continue to positively affect practitioners long into the future, and we believe the Education Portal will be classified as a model of good practice in grassroots European sport development.", "http://www.scotlandrl.com", "RLEF LIMITED", "erasmus_567122-EPP-1-2015-2-UK-SPO-SCP_7"], [2016, "Preventing threats to sport integrity among young high level athletes through development of mental skills", "SCOTTISH CANOE ASSOCIATION", 45989.0, 3, 3, "The mental skills for sport integrity project is a 18 monthes small collaborative project whose ambition is to demonstrate the contribution and potential of mental skills development programmes to preserve sport integrity and prevent misbehaviour among young both high level and amateur athletes.This project is based on an innovative consortium gathering a regional sport performance training centre, a national sport federation and a national sport education promotion body araising from 3 different cultural contexts (France, Italy, United Kingdom).

Guidelines are also typically developed as a one-size-fits-all package. By developing and evaluating targeted dissemination strategies, DECIDE aims to increase the use of evidence-based interventions in a sustainable way and to reduce the use of interventions where benefits are uncertain.\n\nMethods: GRADE is a systematic approach towards assessing and communicating the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. It has been developed to address the weaknesses of other grading systems and is now widely used internationally. The DECIDE consortium, which is composed of members of the GRADE Working Group, will further develop this approach to ensure effective dissemination of evidence-based recommendations targeted at the key stakeholders (healthcare professionals; policymakers and managers; patients and the general public) who determine what happens in clinical practice. We will collect stakeholder input from advisory groups, consultations and user testing. This will be done across a wide range of health systems in Europe. The targeted dissemination strategies that are developed will be evaluated in randomized trials, refined and used and evaluated with real guidelines developed by the DECIDE partners and other guideline developers that we support.\n\nExpected results: Dissemination strategies for recommendations that have been rigorously evaluated in diverse settings, support the transfer of research into practice, and are adapted to real-world healthcare systems.", 183328.0, 3082480.0, 8, 13, "DECIDE", null, "http://www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org", null, "fp7_97693_955738285"], [1430438400000, 1540944000000, "I-MOVE+ Integrated Monitoring of Vaccines Effects in Europe: a platform to measure and compare effectiveness and impact of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines and vaccination strategies in the elderly", "Nhs National Services Scotland", "The I-MOVE\\ Consortium includes European Union (EU) Public Health Institutes, SME and Universities.
