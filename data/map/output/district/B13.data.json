The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.  It is also important to maintain the interest for internationalization at the schools where projects already exist.  \r\n\u2022 Increase the language competence and the interest in foreign languages, for head teachers, teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nIn our project there are eight head teachers and three deputy head teachers from the schools G\u00f6kstensskolan, Hammarg\u00e4rdets skola, \u00c4rstaskolan, Tegelviken, Bj\u00f6rktorpsskolan, Skiftingehus, Fr\u00f6slundaskolan och St\u00e5lforsskolan.

Recent campaigns have covered a wide range of issues that girls and women continue to face every day, including This Girl Can and #MeToo. The movement also includes issues such as the gender pay gap, which was on average 16.3% in Europe in 2015. Whilst international actors such as the European Commission and the Sustainable Development Goals have pledged to achieve gender equality, imbalances continue to persist. Our project would enable youth workers to learn about and become promoters of gender equality on local, national and international scales. It will educate young people about the benefits of equality, whilst also ensuring the inclusion of female participants from disadvantaged backgrounds during the project itself. The project\u2019s content will be primarily built upon participants discussing their experiences, allowing them to analyse the different forms of gender discrimination across Europe before undertaking their own campaigns.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\n- To understand the causes of gender discrimination. This will consider the religious cultural \u2018norms\u2019 of some societies, the assumed roles of different gender based on characteristics and stereotypes, and the lack of facilitation for women in employment and education.\r\n- To learn about the different forms of gender-based discrimination. This includes the gender pay gap, the types of jobs typically taken up by women/men, gender-based violence, and the expected roles of women in society.\r\n- To discover any disparities between gender-based discrimination across Europe. This will be primarily discussion-based, and thus participants from each country will be able to contribute if they feel comfortable doing so.\r\n- To teach participants about the various feminist movements, both those which are ongoing and in the past, to help them come up with their own campaigns and ideas for future projects and cross-European collaborations.\r\n- To promote cultural awareness among the participants, encouraging an understanding of different nationalities and languages.\r\n\r\nThe project will be made up of 40 participants from the UK, Italy, Poland, Spain, Greece, Bulgaria and Lithuania; selected according to the following criteria:\r\n- Young people aged between 16 and 26. We want to include people aged under 18 to offer opportunities which may not be available to them otherwise due to age restrictions;\r\n- People of both genders who express an interest in gender discrimination, but may not know a great deal about it;\r\n- Youths of different religions and cultures;\r\n- Youths from disadvantaged backgrounds, whether it be socially or geographically. This will allow our project to expose them to educational opportunities and social networks which may not have been available otherwise;\r\n- Young people which have had no/minimal exposure to the Erasmus+ programme;\r\n- A working knowledge of English.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on non-formal education. As a new organisation, we will use our existing contacts for guest speakers/facilitators/day trips. Sessions will cover: exploration of the city, interactions with the locals, discussing the key concepts/causes/effects of gender discrimination, analysing feminist campaigns, trips to the Birmingham City Council House and Houses of Parliament, and the implementation of their own campaigns. There will be discussions around the development of partnerships through future Erasmus+ projects. The project will include the Youthpass as motivation for active involvement. As it is non-formal learning, methods will include icebreakers, energisers and name memorisation games, a treasure hunt, discussions, groupwork activities and dixit cards.\r\n\r\nWe will assess the results of our project through regular assessments conducted by participants, group leaders and Hidden Voices.

It\u2019s demonstrated that companies with more women on board are more economically productive, while increasing the women role in politics makes institutions and policies more representative. Despite that, the underrepresentation of women in leading positions is still concerning. This happens because of a a male-oriented global perception of leadership, often considering women as subordinate or even accessories to men.\r\n\r\nSo as to let women express their full potential and empower themselves to reach heading positions, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do, not only by governments and national or international institutions, but also by society that still has to bust gender discrimination and stereotypes towards women, especially when it comes to work and leadership. Youth NGOs can play an important role in this, through awareness campaigns aimed at making the society recognize an equal status to women in the field of work and leadership and targeted initiatives such as workshops, trainings, support services aimed at building women self-confidence, leadership and entrepreneurial skills.  \r\n\r\nIn order to do so, youth organizations from 6 EU countries (i.e. Lithuania, United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Italy, Greece) working in the field of gender equality, women empowerment and inclusion have united for the project \"Wonder Women\". \r\n\r\nTHE MAIN AIM OF THE PROJECT is to create an environment for youth NGOs where they could develop various competences and tools aimed at leadership building, personal branding and entrepreneurial learning as main tools to empower women through youth work.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a broadened impact, a training course \u201cWonder Women\u201d for youth workers will be hosted in Lithuania on 24-30 October 2018, involving 30 youth workers from six European countries that face different gender issues.\r\n\r\nTo reach the key aim of the project mentioned above, the following OBJECTIVES have been set:\r\n1) Define the role of youth NGOs and youth workers and enhance their transversal skills in the field of women empowerment;\r\n2) Improve the quality of youth work by developing new tools and methods for women personal branding and leadership building;\r\n3) Share good practices of women empowerment in Europe and help youth NGOs and youth workers learn from each other;\r\n4) Raise public awareness about gender issues and women rights in Europe and promote the idea of women as strong, independent and capable member of the society.\r\n\r\nBy seeking these objectives, personal development goals will be achieved by participating youth workers, Namely: a) help the participants increase their social responsibility towards gender discrimination in leadership positions; b) involve the youth workers in discussions and decision-making in an international environment; c) keep the youth workers active and help them learn how to put ideas into actions; d) enhance their social skills and multilingualism, as well as stimulate their cultural exchange.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these goals, a range of NFE methods and activities will be carried out: 1) Interactive sessions about women empowerment and leadership; 2) Interactive workshops with guest speakers on related topics (i.e. How to empower women through social business; Stories of Success; An importance of community); 3) Organization of a public event (Wonder Women Public Conference in Kaunas municipality), and many others.\r\n\r\nThe activities will help the participants to improve a number of skills and competencies required for the creation and promotion of initiatives in support of women empowerment. This way, the participating organizations will not only benefit from the new skills and knowledge acquired by their youth workers, but will also have the chance to: 1) grow internationally 2) increase public awareness of their actions and 3) enhance their capacities of reaching the objectives of women empowerment. The organisations and participants will share the results of the project both online and offline in their respective countries (incl. \"Let's make it WOW\" Guidebook, social media campaign, videos, photos, etc.). Results\u2019 dissemination will also be facilitated through the involvement of media, public authorities and youth NGOs that will be invited to join local workshops and initiatives related to women empowerment carried out after the training course.

The methodology to be used is entirely based on non-formal education approach and will boost the exchange between participants trough various tools such as role play, thetre, simulations, team and trust building games, creative presentations and discussions, etc.  The need of the project lays on the fact that in last few years in Europe  we observe increasing number of young people being drawn into extremist movements in their search for identity and a meaningful place in society. Profound feelings of injustice and frustration about their social exclusion are amongst the main root causes contributing to young people's vulnerability, and increase their willingness to adhere to extremist, sometimes violent groups, which offer an apparent social purpose to them.

As climate change is an increasingly significant issue across the world, more people will be forced to migrate into the near-future. However, as these people are not protected under international law, governments will encounter further immigration obstacles if these people are viewed as economic migrants rather than refugees. At the same time, there is a rather worrying trend - increased fear of newcomers, misunderstanding and unwillingness to engage and accept the migrants in the local community, which in many cases come to use hate speech and violence based on hatred towards refugees. According to a report by the Council of Europe's Commission against Racism and Intolerance for 2015, there is a climate of intolerance and xenophobia against refugees all over Europe. More and more ultranationalist groups and political parties are operating in some parts of Europe.
