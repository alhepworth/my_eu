Expand ambitions of regions with respect to regional economic development based on waste management RTD, innovation &amp;amp;amp; business creation; 2. Expand international &amp;amp;amp; mentoring roles of waste management-related actors; 3. Create an international role as a European network of (regional) waste management-related clusters.

Four regions particpate: Emilia-Romagna region (Italy), Yorkshire &amp;amp;amp; Humber region (UK), Sofia region (Bulgaria) and Amsterdam region (the Netherlands). Regions of Knowledge experiences gave the consortium argument that 4 regions will lead to high (regional) impact potentials looking at characteristics of waste management infrastructures and RTD &amp;amp;amp; innovation processes. Each region is represented via triple helix actors: regional/local authority or related organisation, knowledge institution and company, including linkages with intermediary actors. 19 consortium partners contribute to WASTEKIT.

Aside from the social costs in terms of suffering, they account for 70% on European average of public healthcare systems in the EU. A plethora of ICT based applications have been developed in the last years, allowing to tackle at least partially problems related to specific pathologies. However, even advanced experiences have had limited impact, mostly focusing on pilot applications entailing little or no change on the whole healthcare system. The RICHARD project arises from the need to make healthcare systems more efficient while managing effectively their costs. ICT can be a major change agent in this process, but only if systemic aspects are duly taken into account, such as the interrelation of ICT with organisational and non-technological components of healthcare systems. To do so, a significant shift is necessary to evolve from an application based model, to a comprehensive and sustainable chronic care model, likely to be adapted to the broadest possible range of chronic conditions. The RICHARD project will therefore focus its analysis on the pathologies-specific ICT applications being implemented in leading European regions and elaborate a Joint Action Plan oriented to the integration of those technologies for the deployment of sustainable chronic care models for European regions. This will require a strong coordination of research resources and innovation stakeholders (clearly identified in the first phase of the project) to design new research paths and innovation models. The Joint Action Plan will also be inspired by a medium-long term vision that looks at e-health services into a perspective of economic growth for the regions along the principles of open competition for better and pan-European healthcare services.

However for most APIs currently in use, limited data are available on environmental risks and for new APIs, the testing regimes may not always be optimum. The aim of this project therefore is to develop frameworks that utilise information from toxicological studies, pharmacological mode of action and in silico models to support more intelligent environmental testing of pharmaceuticals in development and to prioritise legacy pharmaceuticals for full environmental risk assessment and/or environmental (bio) monitoring.

Across Europe, overloading of the mains occurs more frequently and this in impacted by the fact that energy consumption in the EU is growing and this has significant environmental impacts. There are various measures taken to tackle the overloading of the mains, including predicting when these overloads occur and preparing back up power to cater for it, however, this solution would only help in minimising it. There will still be some cases of overloading especially due to the fluctuations of the demand on the mains. All the time, Power Grids must ensure that electricity supply precisely matches the continually changing demand from the vast amount of customers. Although most of the large changes in demand are predictable there are continuous smaller fluctuations which are essentially random. And there is also always the possibility that a sudden large fluctuation could occur at any time and the sudden increased demand can cause a power line or generating station to fail. Trying to control this issue costs the Grids hundreds millions of euros, and in some cases there have been the occurrence of blackouts in some countries. There is a need for an innovative approach to reduce the pressure being put on the Grids by effectively managing the energy consumption and demand on the Grid with the incorporation of Dynamic Demand technology.
