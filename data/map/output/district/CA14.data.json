With this recent funding cuts there has been a growing concern that many school children are simply not getting enough exercise, with some education authorities citing this as a risk factor to an obesity epidemic if this continues.  Schools in Germany have a lower level of childhood obesity than schools in England, this project will enable the schools to share best practise on how they encourage sport in and out of school.\r\n\r\nBoth schools are of a similar size with just over 300 children in each and with children of the same age-range.  This is an excellent opportunity to encourage sport and learning new sports from each school and introducing these into the PE curriculums in both schools.  The sports days in both schools could be studied and it is hoped that at the end of the project there could be an element of the sports day that could be shared across both countries, for example with a typical German sport to be part of the sports day competition in England and the same happening in Germany.\r\n\r\nChildren from Years five and six will be offered the chance to travel to Germany and England to research the sports in both schools.  However through joint assemblies in both schools all children will have access to the project.  Both schools will design a logo for the project (all children can enter).  All year groups will chose a sport to showcase to the partner schools, all year groups will skype and take part in sport questionnaire to collect data to disseminate about the project.  As much as possible all children in both schools will take part and be aware of the project.  It is hoped that we can plan visits around the schools sports days and we can introduce a German sport into our English sports day and an English sport into the German sports day.  Representatives (children and staff) will attend sports days in both countries.\r\n\r\nEach Year Group will take part to design the project logo.  Year Groups will actively showcase one sport and demonstrate this to the partner school during the visits.  Each Year Group will skype their associate year group in the partner school and take part in pupil questionnaires.  We want the whole school to be involved.  We will also disseminate these new sports to our 15 partner schools who are linked to us as we are an Expert Centre for Global Learning through the Global Learning Programme. We would also be keen to share our sports findings with our four senior feeder schools.\r\n\r\nThe expected results would be -\r\n\r\nA wider sports curriculum in both schools.\r\nA healthy lifestyle for all pupils.\r\nA chance for children to practise their English and German language skills.\r\nA chance for disadvantaged children to travel abroad for the first time.\r\nExcellent relationships between partner schools.\r\nIncreased motivation for language learning.\r\nincreased quality of education in the field of sport and language learning at Primary level.\r\n\r\nOur local target audience with the children in both primary schools.  We want to motivate the children to take part in a wide range of sport in and outside of school.  Regionally we are part of a network of 15 partner schools  (we are an expert centre for Global Learning through the GLP Programme)  we will share our learning with all of these schools.  At the annual sports days and final dissemination assemblies in both schools we will invite the local press to cover both events to spread the word nationally.  Our online presence on the web will also help disseminate the project results.\r\n\r\nWe will showcase our website and invite other schools into our school to demonstrate the new sports that we have learnt.  The MFL Lead in each school with be responsible for this, the MFL lead and Head Teacher have already successfully implemented a Comenius project and are experienced in the delivery of such a project from start to finish.  Our German Headteacher Frau Zientz works closely with the town councils in both countries and will play a key role in gathering publicity for the dissemination of this project. We will produce a 'guide to German sports' and the German school will produce a 'guide to English sports' which we will be made by the children, displayed in school and used as a working document. We are also members of the 'Allerdale Schools Sports Cluster' which is made up of 35 local schools, representatives of these schools will be invited to the final assembly so we can share our learning with these schools.", "http://Www.northsideprimary.org", "Dearham Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036513_2"]]}}, "1SD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Unknown beauties revealed", "RV Projects (Europe) Limited", 6580.0, 2, 2, "Unknwon beauties revealed is a youth exchange implemented by the Romanian NGO Asociatia Tineri pentru Comunitate Bistrita in partnership with the English organisation RV Project. The exchange will bring together 16 young people aged between 13 and 30 residents in the partners countries who are highly motivated to take part in this project and who have a basic knowledge of English and 3 team leaders who will carry out specific activities in Bistrita and in 3 rural areas of the Bistrita Nasaud county between 1-10 September 2015. The main objective of the activities will be to rise the awareness of young people living in urban and rural areas about the importance of preserving and promoting the beauties and utility of the rural areas in order to facilitate tourist, economical, cultural and employability development. The second objective is to animate three rural areas chosen by the Romanian participants in order to change the attitude of the young people living there and make them increase their self esteem, feel more proud of living there and less discriminated in the relationship with urban youth. In addition, the project meets some of the objectives and priorities of the Erasmus plus project and of the KA1, such as: raising participants' awareness and understanding of their cultures and countries, promoting international cooperation between youth, promoting the acquisition of foreign languages ( English and Romanian), promoting equity and inclusion by including vulnerable young people, assuring protection and safety of participants, promoting active citizenship, developing important skills and competences to be mentioned in the Youth Passes. During the ten days of the project the participants will consolidate the group through team building activities organised in Bistrita - the meeting place. They will continue with a day of discussions, debates and brainstorming regarding youth vs rural areas in both countries. Then, the exchange will continue with 6 days of exploration of 3 rural areas of Bistrita Nasaud county: the old mines of Rodna, the mineral waters of Valea Vinului and the dendrological park and old castle of Bethlen. Using the methods: photography, video making, street interview, role play, hiking, football and rugby game, team building activities, self reflection and group reflection moments, the participants will better understand the Romanian rural reality, they will make comparisons with the English rural reality and they will try to meet the objectives of the project. The exchange will end with two days spent in Bistrita where they will prepare the dissemination materials: an e-book promoting the rural areas discovered in the Erasmus plus context and a site promoting the exchange activities, they will establish the online promotion strategy and they will divide the responsabilities in small groups. The impact of the project will be on three levels: the participants who will develop a number of skills and competences as well as knowledge, such as: team work, communication in mother tongue and English, digital skills, mathematical skills, knowledge about the significane of some rural areas, knowledge about the same English reality, the ablitity of learning to learn and of self awareness. At the end they will get a Youth Pass certificate that will oficially confirm the acquired results. Then, the participating organisations will be able to consolidate their partnership, to share experience and knowledge regarding the theme of the project and to set up new partnership. The impact will also be on the local youth living in the 3 rural communities explored who will increase their awareness regarding the significance of the beauties and places surrounding them and who thus will be more self confident more interested in beign active citizens too and tacke action in order to improve the present reality. Last but not least, through the non formal activities carried out we will animate those areas and we will rise awareness of other age groups people from the rural communities. We consider that all the above mentioned results have a long term impact as they will help young people in their studenship or future careers and also in their future life, they will rise the awareness of the local communities and make them want to take action and produce changes and they will also consolidate a long term partneship between the partner organisations involved in the project and represent a starting point for other projects.", "http://www.rvprojects.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-RO01-KA105-013973_1"]]}}, "2RW": {"nhs": {"data": [["RNN", "Workington Community Hospital", "nhs_RNNYY"]]}}, "3YJ": {"esif": {"data": [[1514764800000, 1604102400000, "Reedlands Business Park", "Allerdale Borough Council", "The project will provide managed workspace and \u2018grow on\u2019 space for new business start-ups and consists of the construction of 2,926 sq mtrs (31,500 sq ft) of accommodation. 10 units are planned, consisting of small workshop space to encourage business start-up with associated larger \u2018move on space\u2019. The development will contain a dedicated meeting room facility, with dedicated shared facilities provided for a photocopier, other office equipment and kitchen facilities to assist new incubator companies. This will allow the existing ERDF Cumbria Growth Hub (CGH) to offer advice to potential business start-ups as well as giving continued advice to the occupier businesses.\n\nThe project will be delivered by Allerdale Borough Council (ABC) as the client/sponsor. ABC will be responsible for obtaining all the necessary statutory consents for the project including the land, environment and planning.\n\nABC will procure a design and build contract to construct the managed workspace using their in-house procurement team who will align the internal process with ERDF procurement guidelines.\n\nReedlands Road is in Workington, Cumbria. The general area is known as Clay Flats and is an established employment area with a range of older industrial estates and retail warehouse outlets. Whilst vacancy rates are high, this is largely due to the unsuitability of premises and there has been no development to deliver modern start-up units for a number of years.  There is also a lack of \u2018churn\u2019 in the market as growing businesses are reluctant to move due to a lack of move-on space. ABC have commissioned a Market Needs Analysis which will conform current stock condition and supply as well as demand for new start-up space which will provide useful evidence to support this application.\n\nThe development of the units will create opportunities for new business start-up and existing businesses currently situated elsewhere who are looking to expand and grow into larger premises. The development will also assist with giving business incubation advice by working in partnership with the CGH.\n\nThe project is dependent on the receipt of ERDF funding. ABC own the site and it is anticipated that all statutory approvals and the procurement of tenders can be completed to take advantage of any ERDF award with an immediate start on site following acceptance of any ERDF offer of assistance. This can be achieved by August/September 2017.\n\nThe completed project will deliver a mix of modern starter units and grow-on space which will provide accommodation for new ERDF eligible business start-ups and growing indigenous companies who have outgrown their existing accommodation.
