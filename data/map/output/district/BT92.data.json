They require very specific climatic conditions - persistently wet and cool - in order to allow the growth of Sphagnum rich vegetation which is usually only found on the fringes of large oceans at high latitude. The Flow Country in North Scotland is a prime location for this priority habitat. At 400 000 ha, it is the largest single expanse of blanket bog in Europe, and possibly in the world. Other significant areas within the United Kingdom are found in Northern Ireland, where Cuilcagh mountain, which extends over 5000 ha along the border with the Republc of Ireland, is one of the most important sites for conservation. The threats facing blanket bogs include drainage, burning, overgrazing, peat extraction and forestry.  These are widespread, numerous and not easily controlled, primarily because of the nature of the damaging operations, the remoteness of the sites and the large areas over which they occur. Moreover, peatland habitats are particularly sensitive to hydrological changes brought about by drainage for agricultural improvement, forestry and peat extraction. Lack of control over these activities is a key conservation problem which requires immediate action if the remaining habitats are not to be lost or further degraded.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=128", null, "life_320"]]}}}}
