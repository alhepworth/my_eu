For the employees of the future, for pupils and for teachers, influencer and trainer this subject and the social skills will be also most important. But we see that science mainly is teached to young people in schools using the methods of formal education. On the other hand pupils, trainers, influencers and teachers come to outdoor centres and looking for active-oriented methods. Companies are looking for workers with social skills and knowledge in natural science. Young people want to increase their knowledge of the culture of other European nations and want to travel and see pupils from other states. Because of this we will make a exchange program by using intercultural, outdoor, environmental and experience education and active-oriented methods. The innovative idea is that not only whole school classes will take part in this project, but 5-6 pupils from different schools from Germany, the U.K., Croatia (as a new member of the EU) and France. Germany and France are used in partnership activities for many years, the partnership with Croatia and the U.K. are new. First there is a teach the teacher program so that teachers from different schools and nations come together, learning active-oriented methods, use a common language (english) and get knowing a lot of the different cultures and of new teaching methods. They also get knowledge to improve their own competences. The second step are the student exchanges - two a year for three years - so there is a lot of sustainability. The network and partnership between the partners will be strengthened. The students increase their knowledge of the culture of other nations - so they can easily travel to other countries, also as an employee. The students increase their own competences for natural science and social skills, so they will be interesting for employers. The students and all participants will find out the European ideas and will be interested for the E.U. and for political activities and engagement. So there is a big value for Europe. Because more than 300 participants will take part in the project. \r\nTo realize this aims formal (school) and non-formal partners will work together for three years. Most of the pupils use a foreign language and all participants will meet others from a different cultural background. So the participants will be sensible European citizens.", "http://www.astonmanor.bham.sch.uk/", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE03-KA201-001612_13"]]}}, "5UQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "SUPEER! - Science. Utility. Practice. Experiment. Exploration. Result.", "Manor Park Academy", 136097.0, 6, 6, "The global objective of the project is to develop the learning autonomy of primary-school students through innovative and applied transdisciplinary approaches to specific education contents in order to consolidate the basic skills of math, science and literacy, as well as foreign language communication competency.According to a recent analysis of Romanian National Evaluation for 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th-grade students, released by the National Centre for Evaluation and Testing for 2015, students are not capable of applying and analyzing basic information they acquired during their educational activities. This shows a great lack of teaching effectiveness: the educational contents are not adequate for developing and instilling students with the capacity of learning autonomously and use the information and their knowledge in new contexts or in correlation. Similar situations are encountered in the partner countries: Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania, Turkey, and United Kingdom. SUPEER! \u2013 Project aims to share the best practices in teaching effectiveness with a focus on student learning autonomy and by integrating non-formal activities in multicultural and transversal approach of the educational contents studied by pupils throughout the primary school. The simple idea is to increase the motivation of pupils to engage in the educational process, to attract them to explore and understand with guidance and by themselves, and successfully graduate; but this cannot be done if the educational contents are dusty and use inappropriate teaching methods, where the general focus is not on the pupil, but on the contents themselves. By equipping the teachers with non-formal tools and teaching methods to make students in early educational stage, i.e., primary school pupils, the project also tackles the issues of underachievement, especially in the case of those that come from disadvantageous or challenged backgrounds.Therefore \u201cThe SUPEER! Project\u201d is tackling the issue of combating failure in education by approaching early the pupil\u2019s challenges in terms of comfort with and attractiveness of educational content and learning autonomy. Learning failures are easier to prevent if the connection between students and school is strengthen this way.The partnership is formed by 6 European schools (Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Greece, Turkey, UK), carefully selected according to their background, experience, skills and expertise. The partners will cooperate for 24 months and each will have assigned tasks and responsibilities. The project represents an immense opportunity for each project partner to share its own experience and learn from the others as well, and set up a common framework of good practices they can use in the formal educational system. Only through this type of collaboration, the schools can enrich themselves and become islands of professional and social change.The project\u2019s target group of indirect beneficiaries (approx. 4000 participants) is formed by all the students of the six schools involved, their parents, their teachers, other important school staff, the local authorities. These persons will be involved in activities organised by each school during and after the ending of the entire project, in order to assure not only the dissemination on the project\u2019s results, but also its multiplication and even its replication in other schools of the city/country involved through its present representatives. The project staff established two types of expected results: quantitative and qualitative. By applying the schedule and the specific procedures and by developing successfully the planned activities (4 short-term staff training events, including 1 transnational training session, 3 short-term staff events - job shadowing type and 1 short-term exchange of groups of pupils), the project team expects to obtain several quantitative results in terms of materials or products to be used by direct and indirect beneficiaries during and after the completion of the SUPEER! Project, and also of qualitative expected results in terms of acquiring and developing basic skills in Maths, Sciences and Literacy, combating underachievement or failure education, acquiring and applying non-formal methods/tools in the teaching-learning activities.European cooperation is one of the main elements that define the communitarian policies and programmes. It is actually the core element of the European Union. The SUPEER! Project is tackling this cooperation in an area that it is usually forgotten or left aside as being less important from a short-term perspective, which is the self-advancement of primary school students. Just as it can be an example of best practice for Romanian educational system, the SUPEER! Project can also serve as a best practice at European level. And especially from the point of view of cultural, ethnic etc. tolerance, now, when many claim that European fundamental values are put to test.", "http://www.manorpark.bham.sch.uk/wp/", null, "erasmus_2016-1-RO01-KA219-024769_5"], [2016, "Knowledge  Without Love Will Not Stick", "Manor Park Academy", 69806.0, 5, 5, "The title of our project \"Knowledge without love will not stick\" is a quotation by John Burroughs, an American naturalist. He stated that if love comes first, knowledge is sure to follow. This quotation is our starting point of our  project. We mostly  teach abstractly  to our primary level students, away from real life, away from nature, so they forget easily what they have learnt.The main aim of our project is to develop pupils' observation skills, to let them find out  the beauties around them, and observe them. As a result of focusing on beauties, unique properties of their lives will motivate them to think positively. Developing positive attitudes and affection to the observed will end in curiosity for learning more. If our pupils are motivated and love the subject the learning will occur easily and will be longlasting. As primary school teachers we have crucial impacts on our pupils. We have to find survival skills to teach them in order to make them keep pace with the rapid advances of technology. Predicting which skill or skills will be more beneficial for our pupils to lead a successful life  is not easy. Observation skill appears to be a simple skill but in fact it is the most important skill to be taught to our primary-school aged children.  Our project aims to hone pupils' observation skills through applying constructivist teaching methods, which enable  pupils to take part in the learning process actively. Pupils get into contact with nature, animals and shortly with the world in their learning process. The participants of the project are third graders, who are at the age of 9 or 10, and their teachers. There will be two transnational project meetings at the beginning and at the end of the project. The number of LTT activities is two. 4 pupils accompanied by 2 teachers from each country will attend the LTT activities. The main objectives of mobilities are to observe other countries' educational systems, teaching methods and be aware of the applications. Exchanging ideas, practices will strengthen our teaching professions. Our pupils will understand the importance of learning a foreign language and communicating in English will motivate them to be more enthusiastic about learning foreign languages. The activities planned for two years are hands-on activities, which are the best applications of constructivism. The pupils will do the observations within a disciplinary framework. Pupils start to take fields notes when they start observing, and they will develop their abilities  in observing, comparing, assessing, all of which lead them to think critically and gain them different points of views. Interaction with nature in order to explore knowledge will be an invaluable experience for our pupils, most of whom are addicted to televisions, video games, ipads. Having been involved in virtual games, pupils lose their ability to connect with the real world. Parents think that keeping their children inside, either by watching television or by playing virtual  games will be safer. However they are not aware of the harm they are giving to their children by keeping them inside. Going outside with their parents will strengthen their relationships and create a more positive atmosphere in their learning process. Observing how long a plant or a tree or an animal grows will raise their awareness towards them and help them be motivated to protect natural life. We want to connect our pupils with nature since our pupils learn more when they explore and experience the knowledge by themselves. As teachers we believe that when we integrate learning in the natural environment, we will get the most successful results. In order to diminish underachievement in basic skills, we have planned activities in which we integrate them with school garden. During the project process, we will do changes in our school gardens to provide the pupils to observe how a plant, a flower, a vegetable grows. The expected short-term results on our pupils will be observing their improvements both academically and personally. Having connection with the world, realizing what is happening around their surroundings, countries and in Europe or in other parts of the world, will raise their awareness to the problems and develop their critical thinking and problem solving abilities. In the long run we expect to bring up conscious citizens who will be concerned with their environment, social and economic issues and will have the capacity to solve the problems they face and lead  successful lives.", "http://www.manorpark.bham.sch.uk/wp/", null, "erasmus_2016-1-TR01-KA219-034734_3"]]}}}}
