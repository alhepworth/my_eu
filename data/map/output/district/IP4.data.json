Considering the local situation in Cyprus, as a small island economy, new jobs will not be created in the Public Sector and if they are, then they are generally unsustainable, so the way out of the current situation will depend on entrepreneurship, including social entrepreneurship .  Young people also have fewer opportunities in the job market, as traditionally within the Cypriot economy, older and more experienced employees always have an advantage over less experienced younger counterparts, and retired people also start their own businesses after retirement, further limiting the chances of the youth.

Traveling, especially abroad or to a place we have never been before, allows us to temporarily leave our old life behind and adopt new customs, new ways of thinking and looking at the world, ways that can crossover into our everyday lives.\r\nOn the other hand, musculoskeletal conditions are a leading cause of burden and disease across the EU Member States. Europe\u2019s ageing population and changes in lifestyle suggest that without action the burden of these conditions will increase. Health and fitness professionals are now noticing a decrease in the physical functionality of their participant and are beginning to address it. The continual decrease in everyday activity has contributed too many of the postural deficiencies seen in people. Therefore, today\u2019s training programs cannot stay the same as programs of the past. In other words, the programs must consider each person, their environment, their eating habits, their psychological mood and the specific exercise design that will be performed in order to prevent them from diseases and to improve their musculoskeletal functionality.\r\nObjectives of the project: The GO Functional Improvement & Tourism (GO FIT) project addresses the gap in learning programs between HEI\u2019s exercise and health experts with both educational and clinical expertise, in collaboration with tourism specialists. So, the GO FIT project is designed to develop a new learning program, a web platform and a multimedia application with transdisciplinary approach for exercise, health and tourism experts, to achieve relevant and high quality skills and competences in designing the appropriate program for tourists and helping them to adopt a new healthy lifestyle. \r\nSpecifically during the activities of the project: \r\nA total of 6 exercise and health specialists (6 exercise experts -2 physical therapists between them) 2 physicians (across GER, GR, NOR and CY) with significant impact on each individual learner will collaborate with another HEI and one non-profit organization with impact on hotel industry (TEIA, ALBA) and policy makers (ALBA) through Joint Staff Training Event. The project contributes to co-operation within and between a variety of professionals (physicians, exercise experts, counseling) connecting practices from different thematic areas to impact diffusion at hotel industry (hotel managers and tourists). \r\nThe joint curriculum program that will be developed and piloted will be incorporated to the existent curriculum of three HEIs in three different countries, with calculated ECTS as a grading scale.\r\nThe 30 learners-participants in the Pilot of the curriculum (ISP and long-term distance teaching) (10 students for each partner organization) will impact on others via a cascade effect of spreading knowledge and learning gained through the program. In this way there will be significant impact on exercise specialists employment in the participating hotels and thus employment across the EU. \r\nSimilarly, 100 tourists who will use the multimedia application will impact on their colleagues (indirect target group) spreading education and well-being gained through their short participation in the program. \r\nManagers, HR members and Corporate Social Responsibility of 100 hotel industry and enterprises from the public sector will acknowledge that the healthier option is the easier option through the Information Day (Dissemination). A well informed public opinion in combination with the provision of condensed and easily accessible information for all kinds of audiences would lower health costs and foster productivity and work satisfaction of office employees. Easy public access will also bring a wide collection of \u2018popularized\u2019 functional exercise information closer to information seekers (tourist, public), while the wide dissemination of GO FIT results will contribute towards a better understanding of GO FIT program potential.\r\nThe potential longer term benefits: GO FIT project is expected to have a long lasting impact on the wide dissemination of GO FIT protocol and its integration to tourists and eventually to any participant everyday lives. Rising awareness hotel industry managers and  CSR and HR members on the serious social impact of musculoskeletal disorders and their socioeconomic consequences, the project expects believe there will be an increase in kinetic system functionality and a healthy lifestyle adoption.

Context of the project:\r\nI.E.S \"Gabriel Alonso de Herrera\" in Talavera de la Reina has developed a strong linguistic and European profile for the last few years and at the same time is preoccupied by the high school drop-out levels of our students in Secondary Education.\r\nWe consider that we have great experience in organizing European Projects, above all since 1996 when our school was granted the first Socrates/Comenius project. Since then, our school has participated in consecutive international experiences.\r\nIn 2009, we started the progressive introduction of a Bilingual Programme in English in Secondary Education following CLIL methodology and, since 2014, we have extended this Linguistic Programme to 'Bachillerato'. This year we have applied for the implementation of another Linguistic Programme in French for Secondary Education and it is now confirmed and due to start in September 2015.\r\nOn the other hand, the Careers Department of our school is developing programmes to support students who have not fully dropped out of school, analyzing early school leaving and proposing actions to correct this current situation.\r\nDue to the fact that our school is fully open to innovation as well as our previous experience, this new framework proposed by the European Union through Erasmus+ assures the continuity of social inclusion of our students and the development of full European citizenship.\r\n\r\n2. Number and profile of the participants:\r\nThis will depend on the necessities previously detected by our school, being a must to carry out a selection process to be sure that these have the adequate profile, taking into account the following: \r\n     - Motivation.\r\n     - Availability to travel abroad.\r\n     - Compromise to share the learning achieved.\r\n     - Compromise to disseminate the results as well as meeting periodically for planning strategies.\r\n     - Compromise to evaluate the project and perform a process of continuous evaluation.\r\n\r\n3. Description of Activities.\r\n     a. Five training courses to update linguistic, scientific and technological methodology of teachers to take place in The United Kingdom, Belgium, Finland and France.\r\n     b. Two job-shadowing visits in schools of the United Kingdom and Turkey.\r\n     c. A study visit to Finland.\r\n\r\nOur linguistic coordinator will support and collaborate in the management of all the activities mentioned always and will work closely with the school leadership team. We will make sure that these mobilities will take place in such periods as the beginning and end of the course or during summer holidays, providing the substitution of the participating teachers in their ordinary classes.\r\n\r\n4. Project Methodology.\r\n\r\nThis application has emphasized on a careful analysis of the school context and on a conscientious needs analysis, key for the success of this project. We have equally focused on connecting objectives and activities. And finally, we have endeavoured to secure widest and long-lasting impact within our institution, while fostering maximum dissemination among the wider community.\r\n\r\n5. Description of results and expected impact.\r\nThe achievement of the objectives proposed will mean a significant change in the educational work of the teachers of our school, improving methodological strategies and getting a better quality in education. We will try to get better results in: early school leaving, students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 motivation and inclusion of students with Special Needs (SEN).\r\nThese new methodological strategies we want to develop point directly to a loss of prominence of teachers in the classrooms, changing their role to someone who guides and strengthens students\u2019 motivation to learn, while students investigate and share the results with their partners.\r\n\r\n6. Long-Term Benefits.\r\nThe change for the better in this new methodological strategy will undoubtedly make students more interested in taking part in the Bilingual Programmes already successfully established in our school. Our next target would be the implementation of the International Baccalaureate.  Increasing the degree of internationalization of our school will directly benefit its quality due to the sharing of experiences among teachers from different European countries.", "http://www.st-albans.suffolk.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA101-013927_3"]]}}, "5SW": {"nhs": {"data": [["RQ8", "Nuffield Ipswich Hospital", "nhs_RQ8NF"]]}}}}
