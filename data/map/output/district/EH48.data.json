By bringing young people with and without disabilities together in a social setting, the project aims to counter segregation and marginalisation. The activities support a breakdown of these barriers and it offers the youngsters a unique place to meet and to get to know each other and eventually act as a group. Strong relationships should have developed by the time the excursion comes to an end. Moreover, they can dive into other cultures. The project helps young people to understand each others\u2019 cultures and habits. They also learn about history, different culture and current politics in a unique environment. Young people are expected to develop a better awareness of the Scottish, Italian and German culture, challenging previously held misconcepts and stereotypes, hence to develop tolerance. They will acquire skills and competences that are not only important when living and working with people with special needs but are also beneficial when living in a diverse society with a variety of different needs. It is expected that young people will break down both personal and social barriers which in turn will build confidence and self-esteem. Maturity and a sense of independence is expected to develop in the young people. \r\nWe want to intensify the established exchange and integrate new participants from all three countries. The new participants and staff are valuable to this exchange as they can enrich this project with new innovative ideas, experiences and talents. Young people with various disabilities or youngsters with fewer opportunities or those from a socioeconomically disadvantaged background and young people without disability from all three countries will get to know each other in experiential education and cultural education based activities. In this informal learning environment they will explore their physical and mental limits. It also promotes intercultural learning that teaches all participants about Germany's history, language, politics and culture. In this exchange we want to experience a united Europe and enable everyone regardless of their problems or handicap to share this experience with us.
