These schools have cooperated for many years in different networks. Lerum Adult Education, and more specifically their apprentice program for blacksmiths, was invited to the consortium to give new perspective on validation of knowledge obtained at an internship, something which also initiated a cooperation concerning ECVET with our foreign partner organizations. A common trait for all partner organizations is the specific vocational competence they can contribute with \u2013 a trait that enhances the quality of the education we offer our students/apprentices. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the consortium is to give the participants of our Erasmus+ project the extra dimension that internship/job shadowing abroad can bring. We expect our students to strengthen their vocational skills, vocational identity, language knowledge and understanding of cultural differences and similarities between countries and organizations. As a whole, this will contribute to making our students more attractive as future employees. We expect our staff to further develop their ability to identify different competence levels regarding vocational skills, to enhance quality regarding internship and to learn more about digitalization. All this to improve the results of our students and to contribute to the development of our schools, the industrial society and society as a whole. Mainly, our European Development Plan is about making the students see Europe as ONE employment market. The schools of the consortium will influence the development in society by attracting more young people to technical vocational programs since our focus towards the industry of the future will contribute to enhanced competiveness. \r\n\r\nWithin the project, 219 mobilities will take place. Out of these, 184 mobilities are for upper secondary students at the Industrial technology program, Electricity program and the Technology program, 15 mobilities are for handicraft apprentices and 20 mobilities are for school staff and/or supersvisors at the companies. Generally, students and staff from all schools are required to apply for participation in the project and they will be accepted as long as they are vocationally skilled and are good representatives for their schools, the companies, Erasmus+ and Sweden. An extra requirement for students and apprentices is that they have fulfilled previous internships in Sweden with a satisfactory result. All schools use Learning Agreements to ensure high standards, and Learning Outcomes are documented in the Europass Mobility Document. The OLS language test and the web-based language courses are used to make sure the students/apprentices have linguistic abilities to be able to benefit from their internships. Grant Agreements are established so that the students are in control of their budget. The apprentices at Lerum Adult Education, are given a greater responsibility for their international internship regarding their budget as well as initiating contacts and communicating with their supervisors to be. \r\n\r\nExpected impact and learning outcomes for teachers, supervisors and organizations, are an increased understanding of the production and processes at plants/work places in other countries, a greater understanding of how to use ECVET for validation of knowledge and competences within vocational courses, an improved and quality assured process for internship and an extended network in Europe. Expected impact and learning outcomes for students and apprentices is mainly greater employability due to enhanced vocational skills, stronger vocational identity, improved language skills, a larger understanding of the connection between technical development and the development of a more sustainable society \u2013 ecologically, economically and socially.  Everything to raise the students/apprentices interest concerning future work in Europe.\r\n\r\nEvery school spreads results from the project at their websites, educational fairs and open houses for potential students and their parents. An idea is to give some students the opportunity to create a film that can be used for these purposes. The apprentices from Lerum Adult Education partake in various handicraft competitions and fairs in order to spread knowledge and experiences. The different parts of the project will be presented at staff meetings and contribute to organizational development. In the Technical College network the consortium will reach other technology companies and these companies are also invited to the conference \u201cGr\u00e4nsl\u00f6st l\u00e4rande\u201d at the World Cultural Museum.

They study on secondary courses related to SKF Sweden AB,Perstrop AB, Volvo Cars  and Volvo Trucks. The participants follow designed upper secondary programs with a technical profile.  The participants need expertise in several special areas such as: maintenance, grinding technology, steering techniques, etc. The project aims to enhance participants' employability through greater understanding and awareness regarding the way the value chain affects individuals, business and society.  The project is supposed to strengthen the participants\u00b4 commitment, so that together with their future colleagues they will be able to develop new methods and approaches aimed at enhancing quality and improving utilization regarding all kinds of resources. The project does focus on  Business Excellence  which is the SKF interpretation of Lean Production. Three driving forces, continously changing conditions in production and society are studied namely: The rapid technological developoment, sustainability and the effects of internationalisation. \r\n With respect to the idea of Life long learning and within the framework of Lean Production, the project will  also focus on diversity in general and gender equality in particular. Sending organisations are strongly linked to international groups, whose activities are increasingly dependent on  Corporate Social Responsibility, CSR. A caring company is a sucessfull company! While comparing production processes, work organisation and management, the participants will stay in touch with 15-year-old students in public compulsary schools using modern IT. The idea is to motivate and enhance compulsary school students and teachers so that more young people will take the opportunity to participate in the renewal process. Since this project also has a focus on gender equality the project will focus on girls getting more intrested in modern technology as well as in industrial business.          \r\nAnother important objective, strongly linked to the previous one, consists of the European dimension and its focus on increasing understanding between nations and peoples in Europe: the EU is a peace project! The participants will prepare themselves by studying the way the European Union aims to increase understanding through economic, cultural and social cooperation.  Most\r\n activities will be conducted abroad, because it is more than likely that in the future the participants will be offered jobs abroad. In order to create a deeper understanding of cultural features, the project needs to include an intercultural perspective. The participants will prepare themselves by taking part in intercultural language courses. The project is designed to enhance and exchange  experience, as well as expertise, relating to Lean Production. Participating organisations will be involved in the evaluation activities and it is planned that the project will be reported back at seminars that will be held on European day in May 2016 and in May 2017  with specially invited guests from all organizations involved.

Over 40m tonnes of multilayered plastics are produced globally, per annum, of which the EU contributes 9.6m tonnes, with an expected growth of ~7%. \n\nHowever, due to the extreme difficulties in achieving effective seperation of the material into its constituent polymer components, multi-layered plastic waste is currently collected as a single waste stream & disposed of through landfill (at costs of \u20ac130 per tonne), or incinerated (~\u20ac80 per tonne). Thus, the future of multilayer packages is now a great environmental concern, with an urgent need to develop effective separation technology.\n\nOur objective is to develop an ultrasonic assisted chemo-mechanical recycling method to separate multilayered plastic packaging waste (semi-rigid trays, cups, tubs & their film-based lids), currently deemed unrecyclable, and recover polyethylene (PE) & polyethylene terepthalate (PET) individually in order to sell these end products in the EU recycling market & thereby create a new business opportunity of ~\u20ac4.8bn. Successful development of this technology will create the business opportunity to recycle this material, generating new revenues while reducing waste, landfill, energy & saving ~14.4m tonnes of CO2 emissions per annum.

In 2008, its value was \u20ac55 bn, but fell to \u20ac43 bn in 2009. The industry continues to contract, struggling against low cost economies. While energy cost savings are welcome, cycle time dominates cost so reducing it is key & will increase productivity. Cycle time is dominated by cooling time, which depends on many factors including melt temp. Polymers are often heated well above the ideal melt temp. to aid injection by lowering viscosity. Similarly, very high injection speeds/pressures are used. But we show later that these methods have drawbacks. Our idea is to apply ultrasonic energy into the molten polymer just before it enters the cavity. This can achieve as much as 60% reduction in melt viscosity, enabling a significant reduction in melt temp. while still being able to fill the mould. Lower embodied heat reduces heating/cooling time & energy. \n\nKey benefits are that melt temps. can be maintained and the lower viscosity used to enable easier filling of existing parts with lower internal stresses; melt temp. can be reduced significantly, reducing thermal degradation, energy consumption & cooling time. Or melt temp is maintained and much longer flow paths or thinner wall sections can be filled, offering a step change in design for thinner parts with even shorter cooling time. The ultimate goal of the Phase 2 project is to achieve market readiness of the \u2018Ultramelt\u2019 process, with follow-on Phase 3 achieving commercialisation in the EU marketplace.

The most demanding and time-consuming step is the microtomy, where the tissue sample, now dehydrated and placed inside a piece of paraffin wax, is cut into slices 4-micrometre thick. This step is further complicated by the fact that the thin slices become wrinkled with the cutting and are normally put on warm water in order to smooth out (the with the aggravated problems of rehydrating the cells and increasing the risk of cross-contamination).
