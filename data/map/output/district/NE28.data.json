We have also planned for a wide range of pupil involvement, whether through mobility or activities within school.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the project we expect that the results and impacts on each school will be:\r\n- staff, pupils and other actors showing greater intercultural understanding and enthusiasm for exchange\r\n- an improvement in literacy, numeracy, language and digital competences\r\n- developments made in the provision of early education (in all schools) as a direct result of the activity in Germany\r\n- amendments made to the teaching of key skills in reference to investigation into local employment markets\r\n- links established with the next stages of education and work places\r\n- a commitment made to reduce barriers to education (for example an enhancement in special needs provision, parental involvement or extra curricular activities)\r\n- a sustainable school with commitment to environmental education, 'green' attitudes and with national recognition of this (where available)\r\n- pupils will be committed to developing their own skills to be successful and will have enhanced skills to support them in this\r\n\r\nThe long term benefits of this project are numerous. All of the previously mentioned results and impacts are long term gains for the school. By involving as many pupils and staff members in the project as possible, any amendments made to practice in light of this project will be integrated into every aspect of each school. As well as this amending staff behaviour this means we'll also have resilient learners who are more focused on their employment opportunities and about making the most of their time at school. We will have also developed strong and long-lasting links.", null, "St Bernadette's RC Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000319_coordinator"], [2017, "Let's hit the road!", "Beacon Hill School", 106647.0, 4, 4, "In the era of the \"global village\", education cannot stand still when the world is being rapidly changed by advanced communication technology,. Every day students benefit from ICT achievements, such as the various range of apps. These become their natural tools in learning and leisure time. By introducing elements of education without borders to the school offerings, the learning process becomes more attractive and accessible. Traditional teaching methods alone are not meeting the needs of disabled students. The best way is the method of \"Learning by doing\", in which students learn, experience, become active participants in the process of learning-teaching. In order to improve the educational offer of schools and the equalization of opportunities for persons with disabilities, 4 European schools (ZS 16 from Poland, Beacon Hill School from UK, CCOO Tomislav Spoljar from Croatia, Escola Secundaria de Francisco Franco from Portugal) have agreed to cooperate in the project \"Let's hit the road!\". \r\nThe main recipients of our project are students with disabilities who will take part in 51 mobilities. Whole school communities will take part in the activities of the project. \r\nThe main objective is to strengthen chosen key competencies through: improving communication, discovering European traditions and cultures, developing knowledge about the world, to improve social competence, self \u2013 esteem, team working, integration with their peers from Europe and the improvement of digital skills. The recipients of the project are also teachers and headteachers, as initiators and supporters of the  learning process. \r\nThe main objectives of teachers/headteachers group are: the sharing of good practice, selecting and working with the resources and tools to create educational programs, therapeutic as well as teaching materials and expanding the net of European cooperation. \r\nAnother important group of recipients are parents. Our aim is to strengthen cooperation, involving them in the design work and to give them the opportunity of experiencing satisfaction from the achievements of children. \r\nWe also plan to establish and develop cooperation with local entities supporting the activities of the non-formal education and other educational institutions. \r\nAs part of the planned activities are 4 international project meetings; one in each partner school. The meetings will be to manage and coordinate the project. The focus will be issues related to the mobilities of students, evaluation, the use of IT tools, dissemination and implementation of activities. We also plan 4 short-term exchange visits of students within the framework of activities related to learning and teaching. They will be held once in each  of the partner schools. Examples of activities planned during the visit: a visit to the host school, the community and surrounding areas, preparing regional dishes, handicraft workshops, participation in local and school events.\r\nAs methodology we apply the cooperative education thematic using online tools, video conferencing, outside the classroom learning as part of learning by experience, training self-reliance and self-esteem of participants and regular verification of results.Developed during the project, the results will be used during the project and after its completion, e.g .: in the form of educational materials. They are: tourist guides, cookbooks, small-talk, eTwinning project, google for education, video conferencing, a music video documenting the project activities, information displays, brochures, posters, presentations, maps, etc. \r\nFurthermore, the result will be to raise the quality of education in educational partnerships through the introduction of long-term changes in the education and treatment of people with disabilities. Students will be more motivated to actively participate in school activities, creating new activities, and daily challenges. This leads to an increase in their knowledge of the culture, customs, geography, of the partner countries as well as their own self-esteem. They integrate with their peers from other parts of Europe which will increase their motivation to learn foreign languages. Participation in an international project becomes a success and a source of pride. Through these activities, we have the opportunity to show that people with disabilities are full and fully-fledged members of society. Teachers improve their language skills, professional skills, learn new ways of working.

A poor language proficiency (English and French) of the teachers who have expressed their intention to work within the working group for the development of the European dimension and EU projects;2. Difficulty in adapting education systems of the partner schools that have emerged during the performance of KA2 projects. These difficulties concerned the various methods of teaching, relationship with the students, classroom management and time. We consider it essential, in order to achieve better quality in our international dimension, to deepen networks created thanks to projects approved in 2014 and 2015, to strengthen cooperation with some partner schools and create new ones;3. Responding to the growing number of special needs students through the methodological innovation and learning best practices from Europe. Our school is very attentive to the training of teachers in inclusion and we believe that the exercise of comparison with European colleagues can increase the skills of the school on this important and sensitive issue.This needs analysis resulted in the preparation of FLASH, which thus aims to achieve the following general objectives:- Promote quality improvements, innovation excellence and internationalization, particularly through enhanced transnational cooperation with our European partners to enable us to understand methodologies and approaches, overcoming the difficulties encountered by comparison on the field ;- Improve the ability of teachers participating in the mobility project and part of the working group \"Erasmus +\" to determine changes in terms of modernization and internationalization of our school;- Improve the understanding of the practices, policies and systems of higher school education (age 14-19) in the partner countries;and to achieve the following specific objectives:- improve the language skills and the intercultural awareness of a specific target group of teachers interested in learning more about European cooperation;- Improve the understanding of the interconnections between formal and non-formal education, vocational training and the labor market: all partner schools are in fact mixed institutes general + VET providing considerable attention to training for entry into the labor market, to self-employment and to a good alternance between school and work;-Improve the ability to address the needs of the least advantaged, with specific reference to the acquisition of skills in the area of inclusive best practices.The project involves 9 units of teaching staff in 18 mobilities, including 9 job shadowing and 9 training courses. The staff corresponds to different teaching profiles i.e. art, natural sciences, languages and Italian literature. These teachers are those who, following a transparent and participatory process of selection, have shown a greater motivation to follow a path of internationalization and modernization of its skills, and who take part to the working group \"Erasmus +\". The job shadowing will take place in UK, France and Denmark at schools with which cooperation is already in place thanks to KA2 projects approved or submitted for approval in 2016; training courses will be held in the UK, France and Finland.The expected impact results, for the participants, in a general consolidation of skills, language and methodology, greater familiarity and security in the management of international relations, overcoming the barrier of fear due to the lack of language skils that leads to communication difficulties, greater competence in the area of best inclusive practices and integration of new teaching methodologies aimed at the inclusion of students with special needs and their educational success. For the organization, the impact will be a greater ability to manage and plan EU quality projects, strengthening cooperation with partner schools and integrating best practices, certify the results of learning and systematize the professional development of staff. This impact will bring long-term benefits to our school and will generate a large multiplier effect with the birth of new projects, under other actions of the Erasmus + and other EU programs.", "http://www.beaconhill.n-tyneside.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA101-023408_5"]]}}, "9NL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Mobile aujourd\u2019hui pour \u00eatre employable demain", "Tyne Metropolitan College", 18472.0, 2, 11, "Sophie Germain high school is the promoter of the Erasmus+ project 2014-2015 and will give the opportunity to 12 motivated students, willing to live an unusual experience, to go to England as a trainee. They are students preparing a baccalaureate exam (High School Leaving Certificate) in administration & management, sales and trade.\r\nWe do have 18 work placement possibilities  and more (see appendix 2: letters of intent, appendix 3: list of partners) thanks to the relationships we developed  throughout the six previous Leonardo projects. However, we chose to give this opportunity only to 12 participants which gives us the possibility to have six extra safe work placements in case of problems. \r\nAfter several months of training (see appendix 1: work plan), the students will go to England in January & February 2015.  \r\nThey will do a work placement linked to their vocational training during four weeks in the area of Whitley Bay and Newcastle. \r\nStudents in administration & management will be welcomed in companies such as OXFAM, North Tyneside Council or Tynemet College or international companies such as  Fuda or Ferguson Transports. \r\nSales and trade students will get the opportunity to improve their skills in charity shops such as Age UK, Barnardos, British Heart Foundation, Red Cross,  and shops such as FE Maughan and Marks and Spencer, the new partner in this Erasmus+ project. \r\nOur students will individually stay at selected host families in order to encourage relationships and improve their English.   \r\nMrs Christine Goodwin, the manager of Northumbria school of English, will be in charge of selecting host families, providing linguistic support, and organising one cultural activity each weekend. She has been involved in our mobility projects for four years. \r\nOn Tuesday afternoons the participants will meet Whitley Bay High School students during tuitions where they will attend linguistic and cultural supports. Whitley Bay High School teachers all agree that French students show a real interest in the English language and culture.  This could lead them to be more open-minded and dynamic. Our participants mobility could also offer future prospects to English students who are not willing to leave their country. It will enable us to organise exchanges and encourage mobility in both countries. Our vocational high school is located in Thionville, in the core of \"La Grande R\u00e9gion\" (Luxemburg, France and Germany). This location makes this experience relevant. Indeed, mobility with these three countries is a characteristic of local employment markets with the increasing number of border workers. This new application aims at securing this need to get interested in other farther European countries. One of our school project priorities is the mobility development. Moreover getting involved in such a project enables to meet the demand of the objectives of our European sections.  \r\nSuch a project offers obvious and important benefits for our students. This mobility is a profitable experience, useful and enriching their professional career. Discovering a new culture and improving language skills will develop autonomy, responsability,  and self-fulfillment.  Besides, a one-month work placement for our students, in an English company, will encourage the awareness of  European citizenship. Indeed very few students are unaware of this concept because they are not used to travelling. The impact of mobility on our students will help them to pass their examination more easily and to get the \"European\" Mention plus the \"Europass Mobility Certificate\". Thus, thanks to an improved C.V., their job search or future studies should be faced with less anxiety.  \r\nConsequently, they will be more likely to work on the European or international market.  This Erasmus+ project will make our Sophie Germain high school, the Region Lorraine and the European Union more attractive and enhance their values and fame. \r\nWe will try and share our experience and activities with the press and media, which hopefully should raise interest in other students to join the programme. \r\nTo put it in a nutshell, the educational systems have to upgrade and fit into the new ways of teaching and learning. Therefore, we have the duty to carry on with this new European Erasmus+ project.", "http://www.tynemet.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-000292_3"]]}}}}
