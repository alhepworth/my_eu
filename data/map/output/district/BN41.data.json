The annexed project descriptions are only as a guide.  The timetables and activities will be agreed according to the desiderata and the volunteers\u2019 specific skills.\r\n\r\nIn each project, the volunteers will begin their service with a period of getting to know the institution and its characteristics.  Only after this time will the tasks and specific timetables be arranged.\r\n\r\nIn the children\u2019s homes, the volunteers will support the educational team in the everyday supervision of the children \u2013 i.e. accompanying the children in a \u201cnormal\u201d way : a healthy lifestyle, fundamental need...  However, the volunteer can also bring a personal touch through extra activities such as games, crafts, outings, going with the children to sports clubs and Scouts, etc.  He or she can also share the habits and customs of their country as well as their family culture, while inviting the children to think about their own.\r\n\r\n1. With the disabled adults, there is also the aspect of everyday supervision, in the living communities, but also in the workshops where the people go every day to work (leather, wrought iron, cheese-making, farms, mosaic...).  The interaction with the disabled people can be very rich and varies according to their level of independence.\r\n\r\n2. The volunteers will also have the chance to reflect on what they are learning and on their experiences as a young European volunteer, with professionals from the same fields, during the SPJ seminars and numerous evaluations in the local projects.

The exchanges, which will be led by a pool of youth workers who have previously participated in the training, through safe emotional and educational impact methodologies, will foster the unveiling of discriminatory phenomena and will enable young people to position themselves critically with respect to the common acceptance of discrimination.

To increase the number of young people joining the IVS movement is important because this is a well-established and efficiently working tool which spreads the values of inclusion, cooperation, acceptance, openness, peace and can prevent radicalisation of youth.\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n1. Developing an innovative external communication language which will attract more young people to join the volunteer camps.\r\n2. Strengthening the cooperation among the participating promoters through creating exciting yearly action plans with a lot of joint events and campaigns.

There will be in total 90 participants, 80% of them are 18-30 years old, and 40% of them have fewer opportunities. They are from 20 countries sent by 29 different promoters.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n1. Participants will have developed their youth worker skills in many fields (planning, intercultural dialogue, media, communication in mother tounge and in English and other foreign languages, monitoring and evaluation). They will be more confident in their work, when they continue to closely cooperate on a daily basis in the exchange of volunteers. They will be more committed to the IVS movement, to their organisation and will feel a stronger bond and partnership.\r\n2.

Moreover it was of utmost concern to support both young people with a meeting point on location who would not have the possibilty for mobility  and to minimize the danger arising due mobility from Gratwein/Judendorf to Graz there and back with motocycles and so on. \r\nActivities: The main idea behind the youthcenter is to provide recreational activities and to promote active communication and interaction through a variety of approaches (new media, all kind of sports, creativity,  art workshops, cooking, music and so on).  The volunteer will support the team of the youthcenter ClickIn in all areas and will be encouraged to develope own creative projects with or for the target groups.

In the middle of August, one week (also 5 days+ 2 travel days) will be spent in the UK,  presenting and evaluating each project and idea.

The volunteer will work mainly with the Outdoor department, summer camps and camp school, but will also be involved in various projects and activities throughout the College and in the local community. Main tasks will be assisting employed staff in running activities for the camp school and assisting and running activities for students at the UWC RCN. The volunteer will also participate actively in College events (e.g. college meetings, cafes, shows, excursions, UWC Day, Project-Based Learning Weeks, Global Concerns Days etc.).\r\nVolunteers at UWC RCN are asked to contribute in a meaningful way to the residential life - an essential component of a United World College - of the school during their stay at the College. We ask that our volunteers take on residential responsibilities in the form of contributing as \u2018Staff On Call\u2019 to assist the \u2018Staff On Duty\u2019 (the member of education staff on weekend duty) at weekends on a rota with other volunteers. A residential commitment will be discussed and planned with the volunteer immediately after the term has started by the Deputy Rektor and the Head of Rseidences. The volunteer gains valuable professional experience of the duties and responsibilities of a staff member working in a residential education setting.\r\n\r\nWe offer the volunteer at UWC Red Cross Nordic a unique experience of getting to know a small community from the inside, both from the perspective of the College, from the social activities in the local community and together with other EVS volunteers both at the College and based in Dale. The volunteer will gain much experience that will be of use for the volunteer in a future employment situation. This will encourage the development of skills and competence in organizing activities, social skills, cultural skills, presentation skills, language skills, sport skills. The project will encourage the volunteer to get involved in many activities and will enable the volunteer to become more independent. These diverse experiences will also enhance the level of detail of skills the volunteer has demonstrated, in the final report and letter of reference provided by the College.\r\n\r\nThe successful candidate should be more than 20 years of age and have an interest in people from diverse backgrounds and an interest in outdoor activities and/or sports. He/she should be confident with living independently, but needs no prior experience with the activities, as all training will be given. Situated by the fjord, it will be of great advantage to the volunteer if he/she is a confident swimmer, as this opens up an array of opportunities.\r\nThe volunteer will have a supervisor at the College and will receive training for the tasks he/she will perform through courses  and through on-the-job training, working alongside experienced and well qualified staff.

The GIFT project suggests creating meaningful personalization through digital gifting and emotional appropriation: Designs for allowing visitors to create their own museum tours as digital 'mixtapes', and to play with technologies that measure emotional responses to artwork as a playful reappropriation of museum spaces.\n\nWe aim to accommodate the complex ways in which users may confront art and heritage content, and engage users to participate and share experiences that are emotionally poignant and personally profound. Through multidisciplinary, practice-based research we will develop, test and validate two ground-breaking prototypes for digital encounters with cultural heritage. From this process we will develop a framework with theory, tools, design guidelines and best practice recommendations for creating meaningful personalization of hybrid virtual museum experiences.\n\nThe GIFT consortium includes leading artists and researchers with a long history of successful collaborations, who will be working with a panel of 10 lead users from prominent European museums, to develop theoretical and practical advances with great impact for the cultural heritage sector and European society.\n\nBy enabling more engaging hybrid virtual/physical museum experiences, we will contribute to increasing citizens' curiosity and engagement. The hybrid format will also help make both virtual museum experiences as well as physical visits more engaging and attractive, thus contributing to economic growth through ticket sales as well as digital sales.

Being one of the first European schools in North Rhine-Westphalia, it has always been aiming at enabling all its students the realization of an internship in other European countries. The educational programme \u201cState-certified Commercial Assistants with Focus on Foreign Languages\u201d had been acting as forerunner and was, thus, able to establish contacts and partnerships with business enterprises and schools in France, Great Britain, Spain, Malta and Cyprus in the past decades which every year provide placements to the applicants. This year, 41 trainees will realize an internship in the countries mentioned above as well as in Poland and Ireland. The internship lasting 8 or 11 weeks, respectively, serves as the practical application of the theoretically acquired knowledge during the vocational training. It takes place in its last year when students already have acquired very good knowledge in foreign languages and MS Office. The participants of the internship project carry out commercial correspondence, translate texts into the German language, create customers\u2019 files, participate in customer acquisition, verify transport documents and carry out tasks of the front or back office in hotels. Five interns of the course of \u201cForeign Language Correspondence Clerks\u201d will realise their 3-weeks-internship in Great Britain  towards the end of their second year of traineeship. For these students there also exists a pool of partner companies which annually take new interns or help them to find a placement in order to apply and broaden their language skills. Moreover, the internships serve to gain new insights into the practical work of an enterprise. As a consequence, the participants support the employees when doing their daily work and \u2013 depending on the respective branch \u2013 carry out tasks like the re-organisation of a clients\u2019 file, the research of information about topics communicated beforehand or the assistance in an event\u2019s organisation. \r\nFurthermore, this year 10 trainees of the vocational courses \u201cIndividual Insurance\u201d, \u201cRetailers\u201d and \u201cPersonnel Service Providers\u201d will do their 3-weeks-internship in European countries, frequently in subsidiaries of their employing company, where they are offered the opportunity to work quite goal-oriented taking into account probable cultural differences. For the first time, two students of the educational programme called \u201cCommercial College\u201d are aiming at a 2-weeks-internship abroad. Within the framework of the college\u2019s strategy of internationalisation, it is planned to establish a pool of partner enterprises, too, in order to offer the possibility of taking part in the internship programme to even more students than those of the courses mentioned above. Without the financial support and the formal framework of the ERASMUS+, students of any of the college\u2019s educational programmes could hardly realise an internship abroad. All participants firstly apply in writing for a scholarship with the respective colleague in charge. \u201cBerufskolleg Suedstadt\u201d has got an EU-Team which is led by a project coordinator. Two other colleagues are responsible for the financial processing and insurance matters. Additionally, in each educational programme there is a colleague who is familiar with its specific circumstances and supervises the trainees. Due to the high number of interns deriving from the \u201cAssistants with Focus on Foreign Languages\u201d, there is a colleague responsible for English-speaking EU-countries, Spain and France each, whereas singular internships in Poland this year and the like are cared for by the project coordinator. Once a general overview of the internship programme has been provided by the project coordinator, the teachers in charge draw a selection of the participants, prepare the internship itself, care for the students during their stay abroad and monitor the follow-up work after their return. This also comprises an intensive maintenance of the contact with partner institutions. Due to the possibility of job-shadowing, the personal mobilities in France, Great Britain and Malta predominantly serve the upgrading and broadening of content aspects, especially in foreign trade, customer communication and development of the vocational education in various European countries. Moreover, language skills are intensified and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 improved. The personal maintenance of the contacts with partnership firms enabled by these mobilities, is a vital factor of the project\u2019s success and must not be underestimated. In order to take part in a personal mobility, the staff applies to the head of the college who - according to the qualification and demand \u2013 decides for the teacher to take part in the project. The results of the personal mobilities are communicated to the staff in team meetings, conferences of members of the same subject or educational programme and the students.", "http://www.loxdale.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004666_14"], [2017, "APL in Europe", "Loxdale English Centre/Swedish Folk High School", 88984.0, 3, 3, "For several years, Midsommarkransens gymnasium has cooperated with Loxdale Centre in Brighton, England, as well as Lyc\u00e9e priv\u00e9 chalonnais Saint Charles.

They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.\r\nDue to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.\r\nAt a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training. What concerns us primarily is that for teaching purposes didactically reduced case studies become verified in a real environment in order to enhance the students\u2019 chances on the European labour market.\r\nAs this is a full-time vocational school training, the trainees have got few opportunities to work in side jobs to earn their own living. Thus, doing an internship in a foreign country does not only mean financial losses during the time of their stay but also considerable problems in raising the funds for a period abroad. Only if our trainees will be sponsored by the ERASMUS+ programme, we are able to realise our project which is continually carried out and supervised by qualified teachers experienced in this area.\r\nMoreover, this programme constitutes the frame of security, trustworthiness, approval and professional advice and support which is so important to our partners and beneficiaries.\r\nThis year\u2019s project of 8 to 11 weeks will be carried out in companies and institutions based in the UK, France, Spain, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey.
