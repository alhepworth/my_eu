Target groups: adult people aged 18 and older who are seeking to be trained as Welding labourers and welding Team Leaders, and enterprises which use welding as part of their business. Two Outputs will be reached by the project: 1. International Welder's (IW) training programme and material; 2. An online Team Leader training programme \"E-WeldLead\". \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll project partner countries (Lithuanian, Slovenia, Denmark and the UK) have a well-developed manufacturing industry, however, the fast dynamics of the welding technology and science requires constant upgrading of pedagogical material and worldwide standards. Lithuania is the only country among the partners that does not provide welding training at an international standard for the welding labourers. In Lithuania, around 700 companies are actively using welding technology. According to the Lithuanian Job Centre, the Welder is among the top 10 most demanded professions and the demand for the welding labour has been increasing over the past five years: in 2009, the Lithuanian Job Centre advertised 1,7 thousand welder vacancies, in 2010 \u2013 2,5 thousand, in 2011 \u2013 2,9 thousand, in 2012 \u2013 3,1 thousand, and in 2013 - 3,8 thousand. The qualified welders are required in shipbuilding, metal construction and repair, building, and many other sectors. Despite the fact that Lithuania has around 46 education establishments providing training in different types of welding, the companies still suffer from a lack of welding labourers.  This is caused by that the diplomas of the Lithuanian vocational schools are not recognized by International Welding Organisations such as International Institute of Welding (IIW) and European Welding Federation (EWF).  This blocks the employment possibilities for many vocational school graduates and negatively impacts on the Lithuanian welding industry which works in the environment of a tough business rivalry. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few years ago, two universities in Lithuania became ATBs. These two particular ATBs were established for the preparation of the senior welding specialists such as IWS (International Welding Specialist) or IWE (International Welding Engineer). However, Lithuania still does not have a vocational training body which would be accredited to provide international training for the welding labourers. Therefore, PO Vilnius Jerusalem Labour Market Training Centre (VJLMTC) aims to become an ATB during this project. The main purpose of becoming an ATB is the preparation of the International Welder's (IW) training curriculum that meets the requirements of IIW and EWF. It would ensure that Lithuanian welding industry is provided with the suitably qualified welding labour, and that the graduates of the VJLMTC have high prospects of employment. VJLMTC teachers will upgrade their qualification to meet IIW requirements during this project. Piloting of IW training is compulsory in the process of becoming an ATB, therefore a 14-monthly piloting in Lithuania will be part of the project.  WTQuality makes a continuation to another project worth over 4 mln EUR and initiated by the Lithuanian Government during which VJLMTC has built at its premises a modern Sectoral Practical Welding Training Centre-Base fitted with high-tech equipment. WTQuality project is part of a well planned vision and a long-term strategy of VJLMTC and the Lithuanian Government on the way to increasing the welding quality in Lithuania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne more highly problematic area which WTQuality will address in the lack of Team (Brigade) Leaders in the welding sector. A welding Team Leader welding team is not a seniour welding specialist or engineer. He or she is one of the welding labourers who possesses certain people management skills and a good knowledge of the welding work organisation. During the project, partners  will select the most talented welders and train them as Team Teaders. For that purpose, an online Team Leader training programme \"E-WeldLead\" consisting of 8 modules will be prepared in 4 languages (Lithuanian, Slovenian, English and Danish) and tested by partners during the project in 3 countries (Lithuania, Denmark and the UK).

The project will promote learning of digital literacy, languages, cuisines and cultures. It will do this by co-design of downloadable apps and social recipes by means of an authoring tool to develop an online community of practice. We aim for mass adoption of these learning materials with a focus on social inclusion.Whereas our previous very successful LLP-funded \u2018Lancook\u2019 project www.europeandigitalkitchen.com  produced sensorised digital kitchen equipment, we will create for the new project free downloadable smartphone and tablet apps (android and Apple) using an iterative development methodology. These will enable users to be guided through cooking a range of recipes in 6 different European languages. The phone or tablet will speak to the users in the foreign language and offer multimedia help to users in terms of photos and videos. Users will be able to access different levels of help to support their language learning depending on their levels of competence. As no sensors are involved, users will let the phone or tablet know when they are ready to move to the next step. The main aim is to create a sustainable model for the production and use of multimedia materials for learning languages, cuisines and cultures based on user-generated content in support of a community of practice in those areas. We will take 40 digitally marginalized project participants with little or no digital experience. These will include migrant and refugees. We firstly provide them with digital, transferable and language skills. We will co-design the app and authoring tool with them, thus ensuring that the apps will be usable by most social groups in the EU. Then we enable them to use the authoring tool to author a multimedia social recipe for language learning. \u2018Authoring\u2019 here means a) writing an existing cooking recipe onto the system in short, simple stages using the authoring tool b) creating audio files for spoken instructions c) creating photos and videos together with subtitles as help facilities. The \u2018authoring tool\u2019 is a software system that allows both technical and non-technical people to programme content for use in the app. We will disseminate the social recipes through the development of online communities of practice in 6 EU languages which bring people together in sharing and cooking the recipes. Dissemination activities will ensure that people across the EU will share and author social recipes themselves.Objectives are: To produce a downloadable  tablet and smartphone app (android and iphone) which will enable users to be guided through cooking a recipe in 6 official EU languages. Further languages can easily be added using the authoring tool. To create an online community of practice with access via the apps.Participants will learn aspects of a foreign languages, cuisines and cultures by using the apps.To develop a certification system for the digital competence which participants develop. The needs addressed are: improving basic skills, specifically digital competence, and engaging digitally marginalized groups (including refugees and migrants) with technology; certifying and assessing levels of digital competence; learning foreign languages, cultures and cuisines;The rationale for this project is that it creates a motivating way of learning digital skills together with foreign languages, cultures and cuisines, making engaging technology available and accessible to a very wide audience. We develop an inclusive approach to technology design by including users with low levels of digital competence in the design process. The project promotes active EU citizenship and promotes mobility within the EU by familiarizing people with other countries and cultures, engaging with the \u2018Languages for social inclusion\u2019 agenda. It promotes integration of migrants and refugees into the host culture. It combines internationalisation of education with digital learning. Anyone anywhere who downloads the app software will be able to write any recipe in any language and submit it for potential inclusion in the range of recipes available to play with the app. They will also be able to gain access to the online community created by the project, which will provide feedback on contributions and exchange of ideas.

These will enhance the employability and societal integration of refugee professionals, and so will help to grow the pool of available professional talent in the countries receiving refugees.  Among the over a million refugees currently in Europe, it is estimated that there are around 15,000 people of this type. They are presently not well served by education for employment commensurate with their prior professional skills and knowledge.   The project focus is on improving the achievement of this target group in the key competency of professional intercultural communicative competence (PICC). For the language teachers who work with them, the focus is on extending and developing their competences as educators by developing their abilities to develop materials and to teach PICC.  \r\n\r\nThis project aims to extend the reach and scope of other EU-funded projects related to the lingua-cultural needs of refugees already being led by Newcastle University. The project partners all have relevant language and intercultural communication expertise, good contacts with targets groups, and a strong track record of delivering on objectives. They are The University of Graz, Austria, The Mercator Research Centre, the Netherlands and Action Foundation, a charity working with refugees in the UK.    \r\n\r\nProject activities are to:\r\n(a) identify and articulate the profession-relevant communicative, interactional and intercultural needs of highly-skilled refugees which would enable them to find employment in the professional domain for which they are best qualified\r\n\r\n(b) identify and articulate the training and skill-development needs of educators, agency professionals, and employment consultants, working with highly-skilled refugees\r\n\r\n(c) produce communication, interactional and professional-oriented intercultural competence-focused teaching and learning materials informed by robust and evidence-based conceptualisations of PICC for refugee professionals, educators, and employment agency staff.\r\n\r\nThe project will employ a multi-methodological approach. This will ensure that the materials designed are informed by detailed evidence of the needs and experiences of refugees and educators, and that its findings and outputs are clearly tested and generalisable to other contexts in Europe.  Phase 1 will involve a needs analysis derived from detailed ethnographic research.  Phase 2 will involve the co-production of toolkits of teaching and learning materials based on this needs analysis.  Phase 3 will involve piloting, testing, and evaluating these toolkits with networks of agencies working with refugee professionals across national contexts. \r\n\r\nThe project outcome will be a toolkit comprised of two training modules:\r\n- 'Professional intercultural communicative competence for work and life\u2019 (aimed at refugee professionals)\r\n- 'Teaching professional intercultural communicative competence\u2019 (aimed at educators) \r\nThese will be designed so they can be adapted for use by target groups in any EU country.\r\n\r\nThe project will impact very positively in a number of ways across a range of stakeholders. The modules developed will facilitate refugee professionals in gaining the profession-relevant intercultural communication skills to enable them to find socially-useful employment commensurate with their levels of professional attainment.  Among lingua-cultural educators and agency professionals, the project will provide materials to address the needs of these people and the organisations they work for.  The co-production methodology will help to build capacity in agencies working with refugees, and so help them to take on a leadership role in the skills development of this group among other agencies. For the teachers and refugees involved in the co-production of the modules, participants will acquire new skills to equip them to support their peers. Findings from this project will also inform theory, research and practice in the burgeoning field of intercultural communication. \r\n\r\nMore broadly, and in the longer term, the toolkit developed by this multidisciplinary, multi-agency and international partnership will set a new vision for training and skills development at the supranational level for organisations working with refugees who were formerly professionals in their home countries.

To enable an internship abroad for all students, this application is done. \r\nThis application consists of a total of 6 partial projects, in which the focus lies on the work experience the students achieve in this internship and for teachers to gain more English language proficiency. This is mainly for the teaching methods. \r\n\r\nThe projects offer the 92 students (VET, Commerce, Trade, Hospitality, Marketing & Events, Tourism and recreation) an orientation on the international labourmarket and intensive training oriented language learning. The student acquires a better vision of his future labour, knows where his occupation stands on the international labour market and enhances his English/Spanish language skills.\r\nThe practical work experience offers  the possibility of gaining an impression at various compagnies. The students become prepared for their definitive entrance in the business comminity, because they run fewer risks of shortly drowning in the multitude of new information and impressions. The fear of 'the jump at the deep end' that the students inevitably need to make will be removed. \r\nThe practical work experience, in a foreign county, will give the training a completely new dimension. Student will learn the role of an employee. They need to conquer their own place during their work experience. \r\n\r\nThe students experience the culture of the European country and way of working in a European organization. Students go through a personal development, because they live in an unknown situation for some weeks, without their familiar social network. \r\nAssignments students have to do during their internship are part of a formal ending of their training and are in line with the qualification files of the education.\r\nOften there is a direct reference to work processes and competences.

By the exchange of methods, and cultures, all organizations have enhanced their work and improved the content of the projects they organize. We have also given hundreds of youngsters the opportunity to develop themselves, learning from other cultures and make friendships that last a lifetime. This is why, to us, it has been a very logical step to connect with our partners once more, which resulted in setting up an EVS project last year. With the EVS project, we want to aim for two objectives: giving the volunteers the chance to personally develop themselves, and to create yet another possibility for both the STAN and its partner organizations to share knowledge, which will improve the work and projects of all partners. It will furthermore extend the networks of both STAN and its partners, which means we can reach more youngsters which we can give the opportunity to participate in one of our (joint) projects. Forming a partnership with other organizations and working together with people linked to those for over half a year, forms an excellent opportunity to share knowledge, working methods and best practices with each other. Meaning that through this EVS project, STAN and it\u2019s people can learn from the volunteers\u2019 their experience in projects of our partners, just as much as they will be learning from their stay with us.\r\n\r\nWhen working with us, our EVS volunteers are involved in all stages (preparation, execution and evaluation) of our projects, all set up for youngsters age 15 to 25 from all different backgrounds. This means the variety in tasks is immense. To make sure the volunteers learn as much as possible about for them relevant things, the tasks will be tailored to their learning goals, in a practical (learn how to build a website, gain online marketing experience, e.g) as well as personal sense (work on leadership skills, communicate clearer, e.g). Youngsters that will be considered for our EVS project are people with a wish for (personal) development that are keen on learning in an international environment. We would prefer to work with youngsters that have experience in working with youngsters (mentorship) and/or in youth projects. This way, they can compare our methods and projects to the ones they are used to \u2018back home\u2019, this will not only teach them a lot, but will also mean our organization and our people can learn a lot from them. Sail (training) experience would be nice, but by no means necessary. \r\n\r\nThe work EVS volunteers do with STAN is really diverse, which means a lot of different talents, skills and knowledge can be of use to our work and projects. The tasks and jobs the volunteer will actually be working on will depend on their personal learning goals, talents and knowledge/skills. We are there for open to participants from many different (professional) backgrounds, from practical trained and experienced sailors with an interest in the organizational side of things to, for example, someone with degree in communication or PR and a background in scouting. As already mentioned elsewhere, the actual tasks at the office will depend on what the volunteer wants to learn. This way they work on (practical skills) relevant to them and their future. It will also put them in charge of their own learning process, which is very empowering. Additionally, we know from experience that learning things in an international environment in which it is okay to make mistakes, makes a young person gain a lot more than just practical skills. The impact on the youngsters that will come work with STAN as an EVS volunteer will therefore be huge. We know from experience that joining a sail training vessel for a couple of weeks has a profound impact on youngsters, and these volunteers will do exactly that, multiple times \u00e0nd will work with us in the office, be coached, etcetera. Furthermore, they are living in another country, in a city with a lot to offer and within a culture they are not familiar with. They will be trained to be a mentor, work on ships, and so on. The volunteers will develop new skills and competences, gain knowledge on project management, and are very likely to experience a great shift in their attitude towards taking on challenges, how to be successful and, additionally, how to bring about this shift in other youngsters.

At present it is near impossible to get fast and efficient results in adaptation and integration of such big amount of people with totally different cultural and religious background using standard means. The solution can be found in joint work of youth organisations both in countries where refugees come from and where are they heading to with the help of people living in both Eastern and Western cultures and traditions. The best and the most efficient method to solve this issue we see in non-formal peer to peer education. The objectives of the project are: 1. To use youth organisations and principles of volunteering for socialization and integration of refugees/asylum seekers. 2. To equip representatives of youth NGOs with tools and methods of non-formal education that can help them in work with refugees/asylum seekers. 3. To familiarize the representatives of NGOs with cultural specifics of the countries where refugees are coming from.  4. To promote non-discrimination and gender equality as the most important EU values. These objectives link to 2016 priorities: reaching out to marginalised young people, promoting diversity, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue, common values of freedom, tolerance and respect of human rights; equipping youth workers with competences and methods needed for transferring the common fundamental values of our society particularly to the hard to reach young people and preventing violent radicalisation of young people as well.This project will consist of two activities: a Study Visit (Jordan) and a Training Course (the Netherlands). We will have representatives of Western mentality (Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, UK, Estonia), Balkanian (Greece) and Islamic (Jordan, Morocco, Turkey) - 28 participants per activity. The Study visit will take place in Amman, Jordan, 01-09/06/2016. The Training Course will take place in Rotterdam, Netherlands, 01-08/08/2016. The working methods to address their needs will be: discussions, work in small and big groups, interactive role-playing games, icebreakers, team-building, simulations, intercultural and other parties, energizers, intercultural communication etc., plus special activities like Living Library and Forum Theatre. The participants will be given a chance to act as trainers/facilitators. Informal communications and meetings with local NGOs, teachers and volunteers working with refugees, visits to the biggest refugee camp Za'atar and to Bedouins are also on the agenda of the Study Visit. The training Course will be mostly aimed at developing methods for the efficient work with refugees on local levels based on the knowledge acquired during the Study Visit. The participants of the Study visit will create a number of social ads dedicated to the engagement of young refugees to the volunteer movement. The time between the SV and the TC will be used by the participating organisations to carry out round-table discussions in their countries with the participating of local volunteer organisations. The Round-table discussions will take place in Estonia, Germany, Greece, Jordan, Morocco, Netherlands, Sweden, Turkey, UK in between. The participants of these activities will be asked to give a feedback that will be used during the TC to create new social ads of better quality that could be later used on local levels by local organisations to promote the engagement of young refugees to the voluntary work in local NGOs. During the TC the participants will evaluate the round-table discussions in their countries and create new social ads. This project will help Dutch NGOs to better understand the specifics of work with refugees, to use the technique created in this project - to use volunteer movement for the socialization and integration of refugees. They will get familiarized with the experience of the organisations from other EU countries and, what is crucial, with experience and knowledge of organisations from Islamic countries. Other participating organisations (both in Study Visit, Training Course and Round-table discussions) will get familiarized with the Dutch NGOs experience in this field.

Living in a period of constant political uncertainty and major crises of social, political, economic and humanitarian character, young people today are expected to apply critical thinking and other skills to understand the nature of Europe, the agendas of different political movements and the implications of all developments on the everyday life of the individual. Propaganda, fake news and the rise of extreme political options make it even more difficult for young people to build their own opinion and they often fall victims to radical and violent groups.\r\n\r\nIn this kind of conditions, we believe that youth organizations and youth workers have to reconsider their role in supporting young people and the approaches of youth work in general. To a great extent, youth work has proven to be unsuccessful in reaching young people, especially those who are generally not interested nor involved in youth organizations, civic and non-formal education. The challenge now is how to get to those young people and what to do with them in order to help them understand the shared values of our European society and the importance of freedom, democracy, human rights and mutual respect. \r\n\r\nMain aim of this project is to equip youth workers with competencies necessary for using movie-making as a methodology in bringing the common fundamental values of our society closer to hard to reach young people and young people not involved in civic and non-formal education. Based on our previous experiences, we believe that movies can make a difference when working with those youth, and we want to help more organizations and youth workers to be effective at it. However, to be effective, youth workers and project managers need to know how make movies on values and social issues that will be interesting and appealing to young people. By putting together organizations' experiences of working with young people on exploring social issues and underlying values, and participatory processes of preparing and producing short videos for youth that target those themes, we will help organizations incorporate a new and innovative methodology that has a potential to reach a large number of young people as well as whole communities. \r\n\r\nThe Training Course will be organized in Newcastle, United Kingdom. Three participants per country will be involved in nine full days of activities, starting from 21st until of October 2017. In total there will be 21 participants from United Kingdom, Estonia, Italy, France, Slovakia, Macedonia and Portugal. The training course will be implemented by a team consisted of 2 trainers, 2 assistant trainers and 1 person responsible for logistics and practical organization.\r\n\r\nFinal result of this project will be a short movie that will be produced during the project, on a theme related to a fundamental European value that the participants will decide to work on. The project partners will share this movie in order to impact young people in their communities, but also to motivate other youth, youth workers and organizations to get learn about film making for social purposes. The potential impact of this project goes far beyond the involved participants.

In addition, the training course has the following objectives:- Improve the quality of life of people with disabilities, providing tools to improve their physical, social, emotional and cognitive skills and to overcome social exclusion and the risk of marginalization and isolation;- To share experiences, information, methodologies and best practices at European level through closer cooperation between organizations and institutions working in this field.To achieve these objectives, the project strategy identifies a specific context of intervention: supporting disability through animal assisted interventions.The animal in fact has the crucial role of \"social facilitator\" between the person and the world around, with significant psychological and physical benefits and for this reason is placed in therapy programs aimed at people with mental or physical disabilities, health problems or social distress.The interaction between man and animal can be used to complement and assist the traditional therapies, representing a valuable resource for both the user benefiting from it, both for professionals who use it.The interaction between man and animal can be used to complement and assist the traditional therapies, representing a valuable resource for both the beneficiary and for the professionals who use it.The relationship with the animal facilitates communication and emotional expression when other types of relationships are ineffective. The social workers that manage these interventions are defined pet partners or pet therapists and they use methods of facilitation, mediation, socialization, non-formal education, rehabilitation etc in support of persons with disabilities, through the support of the animal.The course aims to provide the necessary skills to apply this method in many contexts of intervention (social welfare, education, health etc) and to learn, experience, export and spread a methodology that can improve the quality of youth work in supporting disabilities, disseminating the results and benefits at European level.During the training course will be carried out activities that include participatory workshops, simulations, workshops, case studies, practical demonstrations, work experience and focused round table.We will use tools and methods of non-formal learning: role playing games, focus groups, participatory planning, ice breaking activities, brainstorming, participatory storytelling, crossed interviews, speak corner, testimonials, group dynamics and socialization, observational learning, project work, visualization and reporting tools, use of virtual platforms and social network for sharing contents and dissemination of results.The course will involve 33 participants from 10 different European countries, belonging to the following categories: youth workers, social workers, educators, persons with disabilities, volunteers and family members of the disabled.After completing the course, participants will be able to design, plan and manage an animal assisted intervention, they will acquire skills on the training of an assistance dog in support of disability and they will share methodologies and good practice at European level on this field.The participating organizations will have a multiplier effect and will integrate the results of the project in all their activities to inform families, schools, institutions and other organizations about the progress, results, methodologies, skills and knowledge gained.", "http://www.opportunityuk.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT03-KA105-008322_6"]], "extra": 38}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "OPPORTUNITY GLOBAL", 628.0, "Multi-country programmes, regional integration and territorial cooperation (22.02.04.01)", "fts_2017_69083"]]}}, "6SU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Mobilit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne des lyc\u00e9es professionnels de Lorraine", "OXFAM", 743659.0, 4, 8, "This ERASMUS + mobility consortium for VET students in Lorraine, also known as MELYPROLOR 6 (in French, consortium de Mobilit\u00e9 pour les LYc\u00e9ens en formation PROfessionnelle en LORraine), is in line with group projects of the previous programme LEONARDO or ERASMUS+ KA1.

To measure the adult outcomes in each cognitive domain, I will develop novel behavioural paradigms with directly analogous versions in the two species. I will also examine whether telomere length, a cellular measure of cumulative stress exposure, statistically mediates the relationships between early-life adversity and the cognitive outcomes, thus testing recent theoretical models based on psychological adaptation to ones own physical state.

The ATL brings together identity-specific content from the senses but the neuronal mechanisms for this convergence are entirely unknown. My core hypothesis is that auditory voice- or visual face-identity input into key ATL convergence sites elicits a sensory-modality invariant representation, which once elicited is robust to degradation or inactivation of neuronal input from the other sense. The central aim is to test this in human patients being monitored for surgery and to directly compare and link the results with those in monkeys where the neuronal circuit and mechanisms can be revealed using optogenetic control of neuronal responses.

I showed that the RNA transcript itself assists RNA polymerase in identifying and correcting mistakes. This discovery led to the hypothesis that this transcript-assisted proofreading is the universal mechanism of transcriptional error correction in all three domains of life. In this proposal we will investigate this hypothesis and search for other mechanisms of transcriptional proofreading used by bacterial, archaeal, and three eukaryotic RNA polymerases. For the first time experimental systems will be built for the simultaneous investigation of transcription elongation complexes formed by bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic RNA polymerases I, II and III, which will be used to elucidate the mechanisms of error correction used by these RNA polymerases. Using molecular modelling, directed mutagenesis and in vivo screenings we will investigate the impact of these proofreading mechanisms on the total fidelity of transcription in vitro and in vivo. Experimental systems built in this research may be of use for screening of potential antibacterial and antifungal drugs taking advantage of the simultaneous investigation of RNA polymerases from all domains of Life.

Indeed, as many as a third of patients joining the kidney transplant waiting list have already chronically rejected one or more previous transplants. Preventing this form of graft loss would have a huge socio-economic impact for patients and transplant medicine. Basic research performed by our group and others has defined this problem but has failed to provide any clinically useful solution.

In the context of CPD in foreign language learning and teaching the prospective teachers are given a variety of problem-oriented assignments that comprise different issues from the field of CPD and will be connected to a study abroad experience. Having developed their own research framework, either individually or in cooperation with others, the participants work on their research questions and thus linking theory and personal experience. During this research process they constantly document, reflect and share their progress, experiences and findings by using mobile technologies. The prospective teachers are accompanied by the teacher educators during their research process either in face-2-face meetings, through online sessions or interactive tutorials. In order to promote further professional experience in the field of academic research, a number of best-practice examples are published at a final conference bringing together researchers, practitioners and students. All prospective teachers get the chance to disseminate their findings and research products after having submitted a proposal.\r\n\r\nTransnational collaboration\r\nAs a key element of becoming and remaining professionals in their fields educators must remain creative, flexible and innovative.

There are considerable commonalities among non-low-educated adults who immigrate to various post-industrialized countries: they overwhelmingly come from the same trouble spots, in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. Rather than wait for governments to provide funding for such measures, the EU-Speak projects are taking advantage of an existing international network of experts to devise such training and development.  It is therefore appropriate that the problem of problem of teachers\u2019 insufficient specialist knowledge and skills be tackled at a supra-EU and supranational level.  At the same time, differences in the recipient country\u2019s culture, language and written form require individualised approaches.

Working in and across higher education, public school and third sectors, we offer a response which engages with the very heart of the learning process as experienced by young people across local, national and European levels. Young people\u2019s engagement with what they are learning is a  central aspect of how they are learning. The quality and relevance of skills and competences of young people who leave school is another urgent matter being addressed at European and national levels. This challenge has been met with an opportunity to \u2018rethink education\u2019 with a focus on \u2018stimulating open and flexible learning\u2019. \r\n\r\nWe propose that a lack of active involvement in one's own learning is a key component in the high percentage of young people who do not go beyond lower secondary education in Europe. Our solution is long-term investment in the principles of self-organised learning (SOL). SOL is a learner-centred approach in which the role of teacher is as facilitator rather than as transmitter of knowledge and learning content. SOL supports a learner-driven identification and reflection on what is, could and should be learned and how. Learning to learn through SOL is an essential component in how it can specifically promote learner autonomy, engagement and a disposition towards lifelong and lifewide learning. We therefore propose that a change in balance of control between teachers and students can promote engagement and reduce disengagement as a preventative measure towards tackling ESL, with a particular focus on basic and transversal skills.\r\n\r\nOur main project aim is to improve school education (students aged 13-18) in tackling ESL through the development of innovative forms of SOL as preventative and intervention measures. We join experience and capabilities to the delivery of the shared objectives of the project work at local, national and European levels. In doing so, we will straddle the spectrum of formal, in- and non-formal learning situations in a number of basic (maths, reading, science) and transversal skill areas (foreign language skills, digital skills, entrepreneurship, social and civic skills).\r\n\r\nThe project is built around the shared objective to develop, test and implement four sustainable and alternative SOL spaces across Europe. The idea of a space originates from the notion that one cannot design for self-organised learning itself but create an environment for the learning to take place.  In creating these spaces, we also intend to produce a number of transferable outputs which can be used by those working in school education, including young people. These interactive materials include:  a sustainable digital platform for the authoring of learning content in the area of basic and transversal skills; a handbook for facilitators of the SOL spaces in different languages; a guide on methods for student self-reflection and evaluation; links to accreditation for stakeholders creating the SOL spaces; and a guide on learning for change which others can use to implement change in their own settings. We also intend to underpin our activities with a strong research base, providing practice-based evidence about how the different SOL spaces foster engagement 'in action' and impact on engagement. Together, these results are designed to increase pupil engagement in learning basic and transversal skills and capacity for incorporation of new and alternative forms of learning like SOL into the school education context to tackle ESL.\r\n\r\nThe existing adoption of SOL principles across our different sectors coupled with its potential for adaptation provides fertile ground for knowledge exchange relevant at local, national, regional and European levels. Our project involves partners from three universities Newcastle University (coordinator, UK), Lahti University of Applied Sciences who will work with the Rudolf Steiner School Lahti (Finland), two NGO's - Toekomstonderwijs learning centre (Belgium) and Success4All cic (UK), Trinity College Dublin who will work with Irish schools (Ireland) and a public school- George Stephenson High School (UK). We will work together using a networked approach to design, trial and evaluate the SOL spaces as well as participate in transnational meetings and teaching and learning activities to share experience and expertise to benefit the holistic needs of the school education field. We will each play a part in developing a particular cluster based around key themes we think are relevant to knowledge building around tackling ESL. \r\n\r\nBy spreading our results and supporting the school education sector to enhance and transform the learning of basic and transversal skills through SOL, we intend to have an impact on national and European policy.", "http://www.newcastle.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013439_coordinator"], [2016, "Linguacuisine", "UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE", 262928.0, 3, 5, "The Linguacuisine project addresses the future of equality of access and participation in learning linked to two core skills gaps recognised by today\u2019s changing Europe: digital skills and language skills.

We aim for mass adoption of these learning materials with a focus on social inclusion.Whereas our previous very successful LLP-funded \u2018Lancook\u2019 project www.europeandigitalkitchen.com  produced sensorised digital kitchen equipment, we will create for the new project free downloadable smartphone and tablet apps (android and Apple) using an iterative development methodology. These will enable users to be guided through cooking a range of recipes in 6 different European languages. The phone or tablet will speak to the users in the foreign language and offer multimedia help to users in terms of photos and videos. Users will be able to access different levels of help to support their language learning depending on their levels of competence. As no sensors are involved, users will let the phone or tablet know when they are ready to move to the next step. The main aim is to create a sustainable model for the production and use of multimedia materials for learning languages, cuisines and cultures based on user-generated content in support of a community of practice in those areas. We will take 40 digitally marginalized project participants with little or no digital experience. These will include migrant and refugees. We firstly provide them with digital, transferable and language skills. We will co-design the app and authoring tool with them, thus ensuring that the apps will be usable by most social groups in the EU. Then we enable them to use the authoring tool to author a multimedia social recipe for language learning. \u2018Authoring\u2019 here means a) writing an existing cooking recipe onto the system in short, simple stages using the authoring tool b) creating audio files for spoken instructions c) creating photos and videos together with subtitles as help facilities. The \u2018authoring tool\u2019 is a software system that allows both technical and non-technical people to programme content for use in the app. We will disseminate the social recipes through the development of online communities of practice in 6 EU languages which bring people together in sharing and cooking the recipes. Dissemination activities will ensure that people across the EU will share and author social recipes themselves.Objectives are: To produce a downloadable  tablet and smartphone app (android and iphone) which will enable users to be guided through cooking a recipe in 6 official EU languages. Further languages can easily be added using the authoring tool. To create an online community of practice with access via the apps.Participants will learn aspects of a foreign languages, cuisines and cultures by using the apps.To develop a certification system for the digital competence which participants develop. The needs addressed are: improving basic skills, specifically digital competence, and engaging digitally marginalized groups (including refugees and migrants) with technology; certifying and assessing levels of digital competence; learning foreign languages, cultures and cuisines;The rationale for this project is that it creates a motivating way of learning digital skills together with foreign languages, cultures and cuisines, making engaging technology available and accessible to a very wide audience. We develop an inclusive approach to technology design by including users with low levels of digital competence in the design process. The project promotes active EU citizenship and promotes mobility within the EU by familiarizing people with other countries and cultures, engaging with the \u2018Languages for social inclusion\u2019 agenda. It promotes integration of migrants and refugees into the host culture. It combines internationalisation of education with digital learning. Anyone anywhere who downloads the app software will be able to write any recipe in any language and submit it for potential inclusion in the range of recipes available to play with the app. They will also be able to gain access to the online community created by the project, which will provide feedback on contributions and exchange of ideas.

Experience has shown that the most effective way is through the adoption of an integrated approach to flood management \u2013 one that recognizes both the opportunities provided by floodplains for socio-economic activities and that manages the associated risks \u2013 which is essential for the sustainable use of water resources. Thanks to the long-term scientific cooperation of the academic partners, the members of the consortium will share with participants a new resilience approach that was developed by the consortium itself in the last years and that is now adopted by the United Nations within the Integrated Flood Management Programme managed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in charge of all flood related issues worldwide.\r\nAlong with the solid academic theoretical preparation, HydroEurope will provide participants with a hands-on experience opportunity to work on real case studies such as the Var river in Nice (France) which experienced a heavy and disastrous flooding in 1994. Through the use of Modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the new resources and the innovative pedagogic approach will offer to the participants the opportunity to explore and assess flood risks and resilience strategies thanks to a Collaborative Engineering Platform that the consortium will create and develop. This unique environment will benefit from the most advanced technologies and the most advanced modeling tools provided by research and industrial partners. The objective is to set up a unique numerical environment that gathers the most advanced modeling tools and allows all participants to be exposed to such technologies. This unique collaborative working platform groups all modeling tools developed by world leading enterprises and research institutes (e.g. EDF, Suez Environment, DHI, Antea, etc.)\r\nThe HydroEurope project is planned for a duration of three years with 3 validation sessions lasting three months each year (December to February). During the first two and a half months, participants are based at their home university and work remotely collaborating with their peers through the platform. A final and intensive two-week phase reunites all participants at one location where they finally conclude their work project and validate resources. Collaboration in this environment demands new skills and a new 'technological culture' to be generated just by doing. This is a challenge for the European dimension where in future experts and engineers from different countries with different languages, different mentalities as well as different specialization and professional experience have to collaborate in research, teaching and practice. Training of collaborating in such new environment is the challenge of this project which by collaboration of the six HydroEurope partners will help to establish common high quality university teaching courses and establish links between students from the involved countries.\r\nAt the end of the three-year project in February 2018, following the validation of the pedagogic resources and the collaborative engineering approach, professors will prepare a final informative report on flood risk assessment and resilience strategies for European cities and in the other hand a synthesis on the new resources and implemented pedagogic approach. The conclusions included in the report will be the main topic of a multiplier event in 2018.", "http://www.newcastle.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA203-015247_3"], [2014, "ROMtels - Interactive dual language immersive learning space", "UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE", 200111.0, 4, 6, "This project arises from two long-standing, global and well documented educational challenges: firstly Eastern European Traveller, including Roma pupils' poor participation and persistently low achievement in education, and secondly the decline of home language use in primary classrooms (age 5-11) as a pedagogic tool to raise the academic achievement of pupils whose home language(s) differs from the official language of schools. The project\u2019s response to these challenges will begin in UK with the development of an innovative integration of two technologies working in tandem (digital table and large scale 360 degree projected displays) to act as a medium through which pupils can experience high quality dual language learning. Accompanying software will incorporate sound files in pupils\u2019 home languages alongside English, and pupils will be encouraged to communicate in whichever language supports their activity, i.e. their home language or the language of the school or a mixture of both. The activities operating through this technology will be enquiries (problems or puzzles) coherent with schools\u2019 curriculum subject knowledge requirements, and which will therefore demand purposeful language use.  The objective is to improve the Eastern European pupils\u2019 motivation and engagement towards institutionalised school activity, at the same time as improving their proficiency in using cognitive academic language for learning in both their home language and English. Collaboration with parents, and the transformation of teachers\u2019 attitudes towards Traveller communities is an integral part of the project so that children\u2019s cultural and linguistic backgrounds are made available to schools by parents who trust this information is respected, valorised and used by teachers to improve the educational and social inclusion of their children. At the same time families become more knowledgeable about institutionalised education.  \r\n\r\nThe results of developments in UK and the lessons learned will act as a springboard for work in phase two to promote a dual language pedagogic approach in France, Finland and Romania, appropriate to the needs of their children and context. The project is therefore iterative in its responsiveness to lessons learned from one context applied sensitively to another. \r\nTo achieve this, partners from 4 European countries will work together. The coordinator of the project (at Newcastle University, UK) is an expert in the field of teacher education in equality and diversity who has close collaborative links with local schools including WestgateHill Primary School where over 90% of pupils speak English as an additional language, and where the dual language immersive space will be created by the technology for the benefit of local Eastern European Traveller pupils, including Roma in the first instance. The project also benefits from two other Newcastle University participants who provide expertise in enquiry-based learning, and in interaction design. The co-coordinator of the project (at Middlesex University, UK) is another expert in teacher education and collaboration with multilingual communities. The UK participants are joined by a professor of multiculturalism (at Helsinki University) an expert on funded European projects that focus on equality who coordinates a team of two other Helsinki University participants whose expertise includes the development and promotion of bilingual pedagogies in Finnish schools and video and linguistic analyses. A professor of education (at Institut Catholique de Paris) in France where a large number of Romanian migrants have settled in recent years is the French partner. The Finnish and French participants will identify collaborative school partners where similar technologies will be used during the project. Finally, the project has a Romanian partner who is president of the people-to-people foundation, who built and runs a thriving school for Roma children in Oradea, Romania. \r\n\r\nThrough wide-scale dissemination of all outputs from the project, the long term aim is to effect practice changes in the inclusion and education of Eastern European Traveller including Roma pupils across Europe in order to positively impact on increased school attendance and improved educational achievement. We expect the project to lead to greater teacher understanding and responsiveness to cultural and linguistic diversity, with improved competency specifically in teaching pupils from Eastern European Traveller including Roma groups. For parents we aim for the project to contribute towards an improved understanding of the cultural values and practices of institutionalised education in the partner countries. Taken together, the intended impacts on pupils, their parents and schools, could have substantial  longer term impacts on the inclusion of and more active participation of Eastern European Traveller communities in society in each partner country, contributing towards greater social cohesion.", "http://www.newcastle.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000022_coordinator"], [2015, "Video Enhanced Observation", "UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE", 195271.0, 5, 7, "The consortium brings together 6 partners from 5 countries and addresses Strategic Objective 2 of the EU policy on Education and Training (ET2020) \u2018Improving the quality and efficiency of education and training\u2019 by using an innovative technological approach to support initial teacher training and continuing professional development.

For universities seeking to graduate interculturally competent global citizens, 'internationalisation at home' (IaH) can enable students who pursue HE in their home countries to learn foreign languages, have access to staff with international experience,  benefit from learning with peers from other countries and cultures, and engage in international collaboration via online learning. Equally, HE staff who successfully incorporate a global or intercultural dimension into their practice should be recognised and rewarded. However, innovative IaH practice is rarely included in national professional standards frameworks, and a common European framework for evidencing excellence in IaH is lacking. A key challenge is therefore to address how students and staff can be supported to experience and appreciate the wider benefits of HE internationalisation. In response,  the ATIAH (Approaches and Tools for Internationalisation At Home) project aims to (a) explore and develop ways of integrating a global dimension into curriculum design and content, and (b) explore and develop ways of evidencing innovative IaH practice. The Partnership consists of three leading European HE institutions: Newcastle University (UK), University of Bologna (ITA), and KU Leuven (BE).  The project has the following objectives:1. To audit current IaH practice in the Partnership institutions and identify innovative practices to be shared2. To develop a curriculum framework for an 'internationalising you university experience' module 3. To developed a professional framework for evidencing innovative IaH practiceThe project methodology includes a baseline audit to establish the extent of existing IaH practices at the Partnership institutions and identify effective practices to be shared, as well as a series of focus groups and online surveys with HE staff and students in the Partnership countries.  ATIAH will result in a set of materials which can be disseminated across the European HE sector: 1.

ATIHA will engage students and staff at the Partnership institutions and beyond with the IaH agenda, thereby fostering collective engagement with a more values-based and socially responsible approach to HE internationalisation.

These will enhance the employability and societal integration of refugee professionals, and so will help to grow the pool of available professional talent in the countries receiving refugees.  Among the over a million refugees currently in Europe, it is estimated that there are around 15,000 people of this type. They are presently not well served by education for employment commensurate with their prior professional skills and knowledge.   The project focus is on improving the achievement of this target group in the key competency of professional intercultural communicative competence (PICC). For the language teachers who work with them, the focus is on extending and developing their competences as educators by developing their abilities to develop materials and to teach PICC.  \r\n\r\nThis project aims to extend the reach and scope of other EU-funded projects related to the lingua-cultural needs of refugees already being led by Newcastle University. The project partners all have relevant language and intercultural communication expertise, good contacts with targets groups, and a strong track record of delivering on objectives. They are The University of Graz, Austria, The Mercator Research Centre, the Netherlands and Action Foundation, a charity working with refugees in the UK.    \r\n\r\nProject activities are to:\r\n(a) identify and articulate the profession-relevant communicative, interactional and intercultural needs of highly-skilled refugees which would enable them to find employment in the professional domain for which they are best qualified\r\n\r\n(b) identify and articulate the training and skill-development needs of educators, agency professionals, and employment consultants, working with highly-skilled refugees\r\n\r\n(c) produce communication, interactional and professional-oriented intercultural competence-focused teaching and learning materials informed by robust and evidence-based conceptualisations of PICC for refugee professionals, educators, and employment agency staff.\r\n\r\nThe project will employ a multi-methodological approach. This will ensure that the materials designed are informed by detailed evidence of the needs and experiences of refugees and educators, and that its findings and outputs are clearly tested and generalisable to other contexts in Europe.  Phase 1 will involve a needs analysis derived from detailed ethnographic research.  Phase 2 will involve the co-production of toolkits of teaching and learning materials based on this needs analysis.  Phase 3 will involve piloting, testing, and evaluating these toolkits with networks of agencies working with refugee professionals across national contexts. \r\n\r\nThe project outcome will be a toolkit comprised of two training modules:\r\n- 'Professional intercultural communicative competence for work and life\u2019 (aimed at refugee professionals)\r\n- 'Teaching professional intercultural communicative competence\u2019 (aimed at educators) \r\nThese will be designed so they can be adapted for use by target groups in any EU country.\r\n\r\nThe project will impact very positively in a number of ways across a range of stakeholders. The modules developed will facilitate refugee professionals in gaining the profession-relevant intercultural communication skills to enable them to find socially-useful employment commensurate with their levels of professional attainment.  Among lingua-cultural educators and agency professionals, the project will provide materials to address the needs of these people and the organisations they work for.  The co-production methodology will help to build capacity in agencies working with refugees, and so help them to take on a leadership role in the skills development of this group among other agencies. For the teachers and refugees involved in the co-production of the modules, participants will acquire new skills to equip them to support their peers. Findings from this project will also inform theory, research and practice in the burgeoning field of intercultural communication. \r\n\r\nMore broadly, and in the longer term, the toolkit developed by this multidisciplinary, multi-agency and international partnership will set a new vision for training and skills development at the supranational level for organisations working with refugees who were formerly professionals in their home countries.

When at the end of a process nearly after  30 years in 1930, that organic farming began spreaded in Europe. Organic farming activities went on in this way until the 1970s and, in 1972 with the establishment of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) they have gained an international identity. The first large-sized regulation on organic farming in the world was published in 1991 by EU and after being made many changes animal products section was added in 1999. Organic farming standards Bioswiss prepared by Switzerland Codex Alimentarius by FAO in 1999, NOP by US and JAS by Japan in 2000 have affected the global market movements all over the World. Organic farming started in small steps in 1970s began to gain commercial importance in 1990s. In 1992 the Association of Ecological Agriculture Organization (ETO) has been established. The 'Regulation on the plant and animal agricultural products produced with Ecological Methods' was enacted in 1994 and, the 'Regulation on the Principles and Practice of Organic Agriculture' was in 2002. The Organic Agriculture Law was adopted in 2004, and so to determine the rules of organic production and control mechanism was generated. Nowadays, Organic agriculture, began in 1900 in Europe and in the 1970s in our country, has gained a universal interoperability in countries located in Europe and the Americas and many other developed countries. However, the integration is not enough at the international level in our country. In our project we believe will accelerate our country in the international dimension, history, public policy, legislation and regulations, inspection and certification, growing organic forage crops, processing of animal products, storage and marketing, animal health and welfare, the problems encountered (animal health, animal welfare, animal feed), and issues such as solutions are aimed to be learned in the size of the organic livestock production in the EU.

Our project will consist of training and cultural activities. It is planned that theoretical training will be received at the first week, cultural activities will be made at the break and the second week will be for practical training. In this context, the draft training program has been prepared and has been agreed with the host organization. Our main goal in this Project is return to our country using the time in the most proper way and, to get maximum level of theoretical and practical knowledge on organic farming. In our country there is no structure like the National Organic Farming Institute or the Organic Agriculture Research and Training Center at the present time. This is a serious shortcoming and, if it is established, technical personnel to operate are also quite inadequate. Because of this, it would be appropriate to take this training. One of the issues is to raise agenda on organic farming. Technical personnel adopted the methods of Organic farming will work to produce projects in institutions, tell their achievements with courses organized and make efforts to establish National Organic Agricultural Institute or Organic Agriculture Research and Training Center. Indeed, Bahri Da\u011fda\u015f International Agricultural Research Institute has taken concrete steps to establish \"Organic Agriculture Research and Training Center\".

A growing body of research suggests that reduced levels of out-of-home mobility can have widespread, detrimental effects for older adults. Adults for whom mobility is a problem suffer in a variety of ways.  Not only are their social lives restricted but they are also more limited in terms of their access to good nutrition, leisure and other activities.  For example people with restricted mobility have fewer choices in terms of where and when they can shop, and they have been found to experience problems in maintaining a balanced diet. Shopping has been found to be a useful way of maintaining physical exercise as well as providing the opportunity for social interaction. However, older adults can lose confidence in their ability to go out independently, particularly in unfamiliar and crowded spaces and may start to withdraw into their homes.Several factors adversely affect mobility, the most obvious being physical impairment, loss or reduction of  visual and auditory ability and of the key function of balance. Less recognised but as important is the decline of cognitive abilities, which reduces confidence in manoeuvring around unfamiliar environments.  The slower reaction to external stimuli and the diminished navigation skills can be predictors of the onset of more severe cognitive problems. With the median age in Europe projected to grow from 37.7 (2003) to 52.3 (2050), the population of potentially afflicted people is substantial.In this context, sustained levels of physical and social activity by a prolonged autonomous mobility are  key to successful ageing. In this project, we pursue autonomous mobility through the development of the so-called c-walker. This mobility aid supports navigation in crowded and unstructured spaces by acquiring sensory information, by anticipating the intent of human agents and by deciding the path that minimises the risk of accidents.  The c-walker is aimed at providing physical, cognitive and emotional support to older adults in public environments such as shopping centres and airports. Its expected benefits are a reduction in the anxiety of navigating in these environments and an increased likelihood of continued autonomous use of these environments. The c-Walker has a merely assistive role: it recommends a course to the user  through visual, acoustic and haptic interfaces. The user remains in charge of final decision making.The c-Walker is the expected result of a multidisciplinary research, with an active involvement of the end user in the RTD activities to elicit requirements, co-define the specifications, monitor and test the project (through an advisory panel) and the prototype (through lab and field experiments).

This project tackles major factors relating to micromorph module efficiency and production cost by assessing the influences of glass, TCO and silicon deposition (including in-situ cleaning). The project bridges the gap between research and industrial application by executing new developments and improvements in the field of TCO and PECVD reactors and processes and transferring them to production plants where the full impact on module efficiency and costs can be evaluated. On the other hand it also takes some innovations already used in other applications like different glass types and F2 as cleaning gas and transfers these improvements into the photovoltaic application. While different glass types have a high impact on production cost of solar modules, the utilisation of F2 as cleaning gas also has high impact on cost by increasing cleaning rates and decreasing gas cost and also has a strong environmental impact by replacing cleaning gases with a higher global warming potential. All these approaches will not only be developed in parallel but this project will ensure a strong interlink between these activities, e. g. the impact of narrow gap reactors on the F2 cleaning rate. The joint goal of the different work packages is the demonstration of a 157Wp micromorph module with a cost of ownersip (CoO) reduced to 0.5\u20ac/Wp. Succeeding in this project will ensure the competitiveness of the micromorph technology and further approach the final goal of grid parity.

It seeks to build an evidence based approach to patient safety education, drawing directly on student experiences of patient safety learning events in practice. It builds on considerable work previously undertaken by the partners. The seven HEI partners each bring distinct areas of interest and expertise, and have links with six associated healthcare organisations (encompassing hospitals and community provision) in which students are placed to learn. Each HEI will in the first instance recruit at least 50 students (25 from each of two professions) to capture and record their experiences of patient safety learning events in practice. HEI staff will work with health care organisation (HCO) staff and students in the development of learning tools based on these events. These will be freely available to staff and students in all of these organisations (around 4000), and, through a web based portal to a much wider audience. The project team will form the nucleus of an International Patient Safety Education Network.There are five intended outputs: The SLIPPS database (SD) will provide a transnational repository for the learning event records generated using the Learning Event Recording Tool (LERT). The event records will be assessed and allocated to restricted or public accessibility, and the publicly accessible records made available through the web based SLIPPS Virtual Learning Centre (SVLC). Records will be translated to be available in English, Spanish and Italian. Analysis of the event records will be used to develop SLIPPS Simulation Scenarios (SSS) and scenarios which will be used in the development of a premise for a SLIPPS Patient Safety Game (SPSG). Event records will also be used to develop SLIPPS Virtual Seminars (SVS), allowing students from different professions and countries to work together on learning in relation to key themes. SLIPPS will be managed to achieve cooperation between all HEI partners and HCO associates, with each partner taking responsibility for leading key tasks and outputs. SLIPPS will facilitate the development of an open learning environment for patient safety education across Europe and transnational sharing of creativity and good practice. HEIs, HCOs, staff and students will develop enhanced digital skills through contributing to and accessing the developing materials. SLIPPS will facilitate greater linkage between learning in classrooms and learning in practice, through deploying digital devices and content, for example in SVS. It is envisaged that students and staff in HEIs and HCOs will also gain insights from transnational exchange and reflection on common themes which will lead to greater collaboration, new and innovative ways of managing risk, and to safer practice. In the longer term the tools and benefits will be cascaded through the International Patient Safety Education Network to a range of other HEIs and HCOs in the partners' countries and worldwide.

It is therefore appropriate that the problem of problem of teachers\u2019 insufficient specialist knowledge and skills be tackled at a supra-EU and supranational level.

It is also believed that early childhood education and care can lay the foundations for these goals in life in terms of education, well-being, employability, and social integration, especially for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Educational disadvantage should be addressed by providing high quality early childhood education and targeted support, and by promoting inclusive education. Inclusive education can be defined as the education of children with and without disabilities in the same setting, mostly in classrooms.  Its primary goal is to fight marginalization and exclusion. Inclusive education can be  regarded as an important way to achieve \u201cEducation for All\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe responsibilities and roles of teachers change with inclusive practices and teachers are expected to understand the characteristics of children with disadvantages, adapt the curriculum according to their developmental level and interact with all children, including the ones with disadvantages. However, previous literature states that preschool and primary school teachers are not adequately prepared to teach children with disadvantages and they do not have sufficient knowledge and skills to teaching in inclusive classrooms.

Since 2012, the CFA des MFR Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes promotes, coordinates and runs European Mobility Programmes. This fifteenth candidacy is set down according to the instigator\u2019s deliberate choice to develop learners and vocational professionals\u2019 mobility in order to open their mind to interculturalism, to Europe and to enrich their professional practice. The 7 MFR are the MFR of La Balme de Sillingy, Vulbens, Bonne sur Menoge, Sallanches Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, in Haute-Savoie; La Grive in Is\u00e8re; P\u00e9ronnas in Ain and St Chamond in Loire. They envisage the mobility of 168 apprentices. Among these MFR, three of them think of sending 2 groups at a different time.The MFR of La Balme, Vulbens and Sallanches are planning a trip for the vocational training professionals and the in-company tutors for a total of 36 beneficiaries.Beyond enriching the apprentices\u2019 CVs to be more employable, the aim of this candidacy is to open up the apprentices to the world through the development of key skills such as foreign language communication, adaptability, discovering another culture.For the professionals, the objective is to know the education system of another country, to discover other educational practice, a culture and a socio-economical environment, which is different. Like the apprentices, they are going to live as a foreigner in an unknown country.The apprentices are young people from 15 to 20 years old, often from rural origins. They are doing a vocational training at a BTEC National level in fields like landscape design, horticulture, management and administration, sales, and sales specialized in pet stores. Some of them are part of a European section. However, according to their age, most of them have never experienced mobility. Furthermore, vocational field, especially with the apprentice status, is not the best natural path when it\u2019s a question of mobility. Apprenticeship is not appreciated according to the general public point of view and young people are conscious of it. Worse, some in-company tutors are vehemently opposed against their apprentice\u2019 departure. That is the reason why we are proposing mobility in our vocational training schools so the beneficiaries can increase their interculturalism skills, their self-confidence and self-esteem and their independence. Thanks to their immersion during their 3 weeks internship, they are going to integrate a professional team, which will make them discover and practise other technics, other tools, and other organisational methods. So they will be able to compare with their own practices and analyse them. In this immersion context, they will also probably develop their ability to adapt themselves and, their language skills.Vocational training professionals are trainers in professional or general education, headmasters, and members of the educational staff, and in-company tutors. They work in fields such as sales, management/administration. They will stay a week in Spain or in Slovenia in order to know the educational system of the country, the organisation of vocational training in their field. The numerous planned visits and meetings with their counterpart will allow them to have a productive exchange on the educational subject and on tutorial know-how. This stay will allow them to establish or strengthen their relation towards sustainability.

Moreover, the participants in the blended training activity can also expect appreciable improvement in productivity, satisfaction with life and work and the attainment of relevant professional and personal goals.\r\nTaking into account needs and challenges in education, the main aim of the blended Programme is to favour the acquisition of a set of core competencies to become a certified school coach, capable of promoting quality and self-assessment in schools.\r\nBelow are the goals linked to the achievement of the above main objective:\r\n1) To stimulate an expansive mindset in trainees\r\n2) To elicit transversal skills through a multiplier effect\r\n3) To support increased openness to personal learning and generate improvements in individuals\u2019 attitudes and performances.\r\n\r\nThe C.O.A.C.H. partnership is composed by 9 institutions from 6 European countries(AT,IT,NO,RO,TR,UK), whose expertise belongs to the following sectors:\r\n1) education(5 schools from IT,AT,NO,RO,TR, 1 university from UK, 1 research association in education and training in AT)\r\n2) coaching and training(two accredited enterprises from IT and UK).\r\nThe C.O.A.C.H. main activity is a PDCA (plan\u2013do\u2013check\u2013act) focused on the project programme to become a school coach. The pilot phase in 5 countries will highlight the corrective actions to put in place before the release of the final programme.\r\nThe methodology of the programme is designed to promote a cooperative approach, and participants will develop skills to critically examine their job and develop an attitude to team work in line with constructivist learning theories.\r\nThe training programme will be taught in an inductive manner through hands-on training opportunities to allow personal and professional working styles to emerge from practical experiences.\r\n\r\nThe envisaged results of the above mentioned programme include:\r\n1) the definition of a School Coach Profile in line with school education and coaching requirements\r\n2) The C.O.A.C.H. Research to highlight and compare the practices used in the participating countries\r\n3) a 130 hour blended Continuing Professional Development Programme in ten modules(80 face to face and 50 online), which will be accredited by the International Coach Federation. The Programme will be tailored for a Postgraduate Professional Development course.\r\n4) The use of the C.O.A.C.H. interactive platform, which is part of the training and a tool for the future use of coaches, who will have the chance of exchanging experiences with their peers, creating a network, using a cooperative environment and conducting online coaching.\r\n5)  The \u2018C.O.A.C.H Impact Report\u2019 to highlight the benefits at European level observed in participants. \r\n6) The production of \u2018C.O.A.C.H e-Guide\u2019 that will include material on all the modules of the programme.\r\n\r\nThe intended number of the direct target group in all 6 participating countries is formed by all the professionals who will take part in the participating institution to the project activity, and by 100 school coaches (20 per each school in the partnership) who will impact through a cascade effect a number of about 1000 teachers within the partnership, considering the whole staff in each participating institution. The other beneficiaries of the project both direct and indirect will be the students(about 6000) and their families(about 12.000).

It wishes it could offer them the opportunity to get opened up  to other cultures and to enrich their professional practices.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 2014, 11 schools will be involved in our project: Bonne sur Menoge, La Balme de Sillingy, La Grive, P\u00e9ronnas, Vulbens. Margencel, Cruseilles IMAA et Les Ebeaux, Sallanches \u00ab Le Clos des bas, Saint Andr\u00e9 le Gaz \u00ab Le Chalet \u00bb and Saint Martin en Haut. 5 of them sign up to sending 105 students abroad for a 3-week work experience and 7 will organize a one-week stay for members of their staff in the United Kingdom and Finland. La Balme de Sillingy is involved on both programs\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground and needs: Apprentices are young girls and boys aged from 15 to 20. They often come from rural areas, they attend a vocational training (vocational A levels), sometimes in a European section. Because they are young and rooted to their place of living, they are not used to going far from it especially in an international context and without their parents. That\u2019s why we included in our training plans this mobility that would enable participants to increase their autonomy, to accept others, to develop intercultural skills, and self-confidence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStudents involved in this program prepare a Vocational high school diploma. Four vocational fields are concerned: trade, customer service, administrative management and horticulture. From a professional point of view, the European training aims at enriching the CV in order to make it easier for the apprentices to find a job after their studies. Indeed during three weeks they will be included in a foreign company, they will discover new working methods and equipment, techniques and tools. They will be able to compare them to the one they usually use in France, in a reflexive approach. We expect that, in a total immersion context, they could become more flexible, and also develop their linguistic skills\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA working plan in the host country has been defined by each school. According to the education reference document, the project managers negotiate the training contents together with the internships\u2019 supervisors before the stay. In our project, students will first observe the activities in their work placement then they will gradually participate to the usual tasks concerning administrative management, parks and gardens maintenance or trading.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdult beneficiaries are teachers (technical or general subjects), school leaders, education staff, and internship supervisors. They plan to go to United Kingdom and Finland to discover another education system, new monitoring and pedagogical knowledge. They also wish to study work practices in professional fields such as health and social care, administrative management in the UK and car maintenance in Finland. The European mobility could also be an opportunity to strengthen the place of internship supervisors concerning design of training modules and to reinforce partnerships.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of its involvement in the European programs for the mobility of the youngster, the \u00ab Maisons Familiales Rurales\u201d training center of Rh\u00f4ne-Alps sets up a procedure to follow the progress and to assess its group projects.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUsually we expect the mobility projects to have positive impacts on all actors involved in our education program. Concerning students, we hope that thanks to this first experience of mobility, they wish to become opened up to others countries and get new opportunities to work or travel abroad. As far as the staff is concerned, professionals wish to improve their teaching and mentoring methods or develop youth integration in our vocational education. For schools the involvement in Europeans program is a way to make the MFR and its block-release trainings more attractive.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFinally our previous experiences showed us that when they came back to their employers (employer?), apprentices were more self-confident, more autonomous so more efficient than before experiencing mobility. That\u2019s why we make constant efforts to make our projects durable, trying to offer to all of our beneficiaries, good quality stays.", "http://www.northumbria.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-001154_6"], [2014, "Europ\u00e4ische Moblit\u00e4ten in Laboren", "UNIVERSITY OF NORTHUMBRIA AT NEWCASTLE.", 114135.0, 11, 15, "Project background\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLise-Meitner-Schule is a vocational school/technical college in Berlin, Germany. We are specialized in the training of people who are going to work in laboratories (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Pharmacy, Micro Technology).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince more than 20 years the school is conducting EU projects (Leonardo da Vinci Mobilities, Pilot Projects and Innovation Transfer Projects as well as Comenius-Grundtvig training courses) and has thereby established a large network of partners, i.e. laboratories in universities, research institutes and companies in EU regions from Troms\u00f6 to Sevilla, from Galway to Budapest and from French Guyane to New Caledonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor academics trainings in foreign countries are a common thing to do whereas for technical staff going abroad is still unusual and due to the different educational systems generally difficult to arrange. The network of Lise Meitner School allows lab technicians to participate in individual educational trainings in a wide range of subject areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities / Procedure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEUMobil will allow up to 50 young graduates in natural-scientific and technical professions to take part in individual mobilites. The participants will stay for 14 weeks in a research lab or in a company. Usually they are part of an ongoing research project in international research groups. Thereby the participants can extend their professional qualification as well as their language skills and intercultural competences. They learn to cope with an unfamiliar environment and become more self-reliant. This results in a great leap forward in their personality development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe receiving partners are research institutes, companies and laboratories in the natural-scientific departments of universities. They work in a global context and in international teams which make is easy for our participants to fit in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants can apply for a grant via our school website. After individual mentoring in the EU office of the school they are placed according to their qualification and their career plans. The actual period of the stay is being negotiated individually. Travel plans and arrangements with the receiving partner and the mentor are being done by the participants. Still the EU office provides advice face-to-face, via email or telephone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe learning agreement and quality commitment between the participant, the sending and the receiving organisation describes the individual tasks of the participant and the supporting measures during the training placement. During their stay the participants report on a regular basis to the EU office of Lise-Meitner-Schule. On request most sending organisations provide the participants with a job reference. The europass Mobility however is an integral part of the project and will be handed out after all paper work is completed (including the participants report). The participants usually come the the EU office for a personal evaluation interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe receiving organisations are being visited every few years to guarantee the quality of the placements and intensify the contacts to the local mentors and researchers. During the project two such visits are  budgeted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Aims / Results\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants\u2026\r\n\r\n- acquire and consolidate professional and methodical competences\r\n\r\n- gain and extend intercultural competences and language skills\r\n\r\n- strengthen their self-confidence and abilities to work in a team \r\n\r\n- increase their chances on the labour market\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lise-Meitner-Schule\u2026\r\n\r\n- consolidates and expands its European network of research groups and laboratories\r\n\r\n- intensifies its insight into international research and methodology in order to adjust the local curricula according to present needs within the respective occupational area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe receiving organisations\u2026\r\n\r\n- get the chance to engage well qualified staff which can contribute on a comparably high level to research projects\r\n\r\n- intensify their insight into vocational education in Germany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLongterm Benefits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides of the individual support of young graduates from German vocational schools the project fosters the cooperation between educational institutions of related professional areas between the participating partner countries.

This is in keeping with two types of action aimed at apprentices and teaching and training professionals. We, the promoter, encouraged the branches to take up the challenge of mobility. Once the programme launched, the Regional Training Centre is the link between the agency and the different branches. To ensure the success of the project, three official representatives have been appointed to guide the branches in the preparation and follow-up of their actions.\r\n\r\nThe branches that chose to join realise that it is difficult to envisage a professional future for the youth and the adults without thinking of mobility, and social integration or an opening to the world. Consequently, our proposition aims to improve the CVs of apprentices, and to ensure a better employability, in France and abroad. The realisation of this general objective will become possible with the development of key competences such as communication (in a foreign language), adaptability, taking  initiatives\u2026For the teaching and training professionals, the aim will be to find out about other teaching methods, a different economy and cultural environment, and to experience, like our apprentices, European mobility.\r\n\r\nIn this programme, 120 apprentices and 43 professionals are applying for mobility. The youths are studying on courses such as professional landscape gardening, horticulture, management and administration, sales and retail, reception and security\u2026The majority are male between 16 and 23, and who live in rural or suburban areas. Most have travelled, but only with school trips or their family. The students are on a course level IV (BTEC National or BTEC First), and in apprenticeships. \r\nThe 43 professionals are either teacher-trainers in general or vocational  subjects, and  as the objective of the project is to learn about teaching and learning practices, in both cultural and professional areas in foreign countries, or, employers and apprentice mentors who  are involved in actively animating the branches involved.\r\n\r\nThe participants will be prepared in order to overcome any apprehension they may have and to benefit fully from the experience. Therefore, the branches have planned activities to suit the groups: questionnaires to prepare for their work placement reports, research on the country to ensure a better cultural understanding and additional language courses. The objective of the language lessons is to start the process of the students immersing themselves in their chosen destination by organising activities on everyday- life themes, to learn more vocabulary so that the groups will be independent.  Abroad, the groups will be able to enjoy the National Heritage of the country during the weekends. On the work placement, the apprentices will gain experience for their practical training by studying the working environment of their company, by learning the procedures, methods, and resources used. On their return, the results of the mobility will be evaluated by each branch. They have planned to put into place assessment tools, surveys/questionnaires and work experience reports.\r\nThe consortium will organise oral feedback and an assessment project for each branch. The mobility will be shared amongst the different branches and their areas.\r\n\r\nWe believe the impact of the mobility will help in the success of the students for their exams, with a better motivation for their training, and better results in languages. We have seen this in recent years. In the long term, this will help successful professional integration, and for a better social integration. \r\nHowever, we are aware that these impacts can be difficult to assess as it is not easy to say what it takes to achieve one\u2019s life goals.\r\nAs far as professionals are concerned, we would like for the teaching teams to use other European practical experiences in order to innovate in the classroom. \r\nIt is also known that the branches benefit from a very positive image and better student enrolments should they give the opportunity of this work experience abroad to their apprentices. \r\nAbove all, by opening our courses to a European dimension, we will enable our apprentices to adapt to the changes found in the world of work. That way, we will provide better quality courses for the students and for the companies. \r\nWe encourage our branches to join the mobility programme, which is one of the priorities in our associations\u2019 projects, in order to develop our actions and continue them in the future.", "http://www.northumbria.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-013997_4"], [2015, "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "UNIVERSITY OF NORTHUMBRIA AT NEWCASTLE", 35615.0, 1, 1, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

However, Youth Organisations in Europe are failing to use the distance learning tools that could allow them to better reach and tailored the preparation of young people before and after their mobility experience. This project aims to use IT and e-learning modules to offer tailored solution to better support the preparation of participants for international gatherings and projects, thus maximising their learning outcomes and positive impacts of such events.The project objectives are:Raising the quality of youth mobility in Europe through the development of  3 training modules that contribute to the preparation of young people for mobility ( M1-Intercultural Learning, M2-Project management, M3-Self debriefing tool)Strengthening the use of e-learning as a complementary training tools by youth organisations in Europe.Four Partners from France, Iceland, the UK and Belgium will contribute to the development of this project thanks to diverse skills, experiences and role in the project. The first objective will be achieved through the development of 3 e-learning modules that will tackle the topics of mobility, intercultural learning and project management issues. The 3 modules will be designed and adapted to the need of the partners to the project. A testing phase is foreseen by the partners organisations, and in particular, quality evaluation of the impact of the tool will be realised during the European event Roverway 2016 and during youth exchanage activities developed by CISV.7 000 young people in Europe will be directly targeted during the implementation of the project with a final target to more than 50000 young people from all over Europe.The second objective will be achieved through a specific dissemination event, which will aim to promote the three outputs of the project, and inform the stakeholders about the way they can employ e-learning in their educational proposal and use the existing modules as a base for that. The planning team of the project will try to ensure, upon request, proper support of other stakeholders on their own development of training strategy, including distance learning as complementary tool. In a long terms perspective, it is expect that the project will impact the national and European level through:- a better recognition of the impact of mobility actions as a way to develop soft skills and competences for life needed for raising employability of young people. This will be achieved through the work that will be done on assessing these skills via the e-learning modules;- continue to support the use of distance learning in education.
