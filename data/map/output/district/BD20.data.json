We have loved being involved in our etwinning projects so far and value the opportunities which it offers to our pupils, as they develop as global citizens. I believe it prepares them for the world of work and lifelong learning in the 21st century. Etwinning is a great way of breaking down barriers to learning and increases the European dimension in our pupil's learning. 2. The project will be a develop and establish a  link with the school in Italy. The funding will allow 1 member of staff from Aire View and 1 member of staff from Hothfield to visit the school in Italy. This will fulfill our objectives outlined in our European Development plan and allow the two members of staff to:-Study provision and transition between  Early years / Year 1 to strengthen our school's approach to year 1 teaching and organisation. Likewise the transition between year 2 /3 and what strategies are used to ensure a smooth transition and continuity of progression. This will strengthen Aire Views system as it approaches a proposed merger in September 2017Study both schools' approach to outdoor learning and if this has made an impact on improving standards.Observe the impact of provision / intervention on the least / most able across the schools.We wish to improve the the leadership and management of the school from the comparison with another European system of school governance. We also would like to improve the analysis of school progression data for different groups of children (for example the progression of girls / boys)We are also very interested in exploring different teaching methods used in other European schools, in order to improve teaching and learning at Aire View Infant school and Hothfield Junior School. We plan to do this through job shadowing. This would be particularly in relation to the use of talk for learning /  teaching of foreign languages and mathematics. We would like to explore how feedback is given in another European setting and how this has an impact on progress. We wish to improve staff competencies in foreign languages. Both participants in the job-shadowing visit are intending to improve their competence in Italian which will be useful in our future work within our own school and our European partners. We will be also interested in looking at how new technologies are being used within the classroom and how this impacts on standards (for example- the use of ipads).Develop and strengthen a link with our Italian partnerWe think that these opportunities outlined above will help Aire View and Hothfield develop a new sense of 'identity' as they move towards the school merger in September 2017. We will be working with our partner school on etwinning project s during the 24 months of the program  and during our job shadowing visit. We intend to have high quality learning outcomes for pupils and high quality professional development for staff. Tim Whitehead is particularly interested in using new technologies and adobe connect / skype in the classroom to improve learning outcomes. Elisa Woffenden is interested in developing a language based etwinning project based on the topic of Ancient Rome and again this will have high quality learning outcomes through peer teaching and learning. We intend to work at a high level, giving outstanding opportunities to our pupils to work internationally on projects with their peers. The mobility visit will give the children the opportunity to find out more about the partner school and to ask questions for their teachers to find out during the visit. We intend to use adobe connect / skype during the visit.

Aside from the social costs in terms of suffering, they account for 70% on European average of public healthcare systems in the EU. A plethora of ICT based applications have been developed in the last years, allowing to tackle at least partially problems related to specific pathologies. However, even advanced experiences have had limited impact, mostly focusing on pilot applications entailing little or no change on the whole healthcare system. The RICHARD project arises from the need to make healthcare systems more efficient while managing effectively their costs. ICT can be a major change agent in this process, but only if systemic aspects are duly taken into account, such as the interrelation of ICT with organisational and non-technological components of healthcare systems. To do so, a significant shift is necessary to evolve from an application based model, to a comprehensive and sustainable chronic care model, likely to be adapted to the broadest possible range of chronic conditions. The RICHARD project will therefore focus its analysis on the pathologies-specific ICT applications being implemented in leading European regions and elaborate a Joint Action Plan oriented to the integration of those technologies for the deployment of sustainable chronic care models for European regions. This will require a strong coordination of research resources and innovation stakeholders (clearly identified in the first phase of the project) to design new research paths and innovation models.

We want to strengthen the link between education and the economic/farming world that is specific to our school areas. We seek to promote the assets of our isolated schools on the international level. \r\n\r\nThe project has three objectives: 1)the promotion of local and organic food so as to develop a positive image of this type of agriculture which is a sector providing tastier food than cheap imported food or highly processed food but also a sector full of job opportunities and fostering 21st century new eating habits 2) give teenagers the opportunity to behave as European modern citizens and present their culinary and cultural heritages to other European friends by using French and English as foreign languages and documents created thanks to ICT 3)sensitize teenagers about environmental and health issues. \r\n\r\nThis partnership has been coordinated by the Coll\u00e8ge du Carbet in MARTINIQUE (overseas department of FRANCE) and comprises participating schools selected via Etwinning and located in ENGLAND (South Craven Academy), ITALY (Liceo Scientifico \"Camillo Golgi\"), ROMANIA (Liceul Teoretic \"Onisifor Ghibu\") and SLOVAKIA (Zakladna Skola). We form a culturally rich and varied partnership that has been active for almost a year and links countries and schools which are distant from one another but united by several common points. All of them stand in the countryside and welcome students between 11 and 15 years old, except for the school in Romania which welcomes students between 15 and 18 years old. \r\n\r\nWe have planned 2 transnational meetings in Romania and Italy and 3 learning mobilities in England, Slovakia and Martinique where a hundred of participants (students, teachers and headteachers) will visit local food production units, discover other school systems and cultures, and practise foreign languages. Our goal is to open up to the international level, enable students to learn in a non-formal way. We try to raise students'awareness by involving them into concrete educational activities leading to the production of shows, videos, cookbooks, creative writing pieces, educational brochures, Powerpoint presentations and calendars whereby students learn and understand that the habit of eating local food can have a positive impact on the environment, their health and personal developments. \r\n\r\nAt the local, regional and national levels, the dissemination of our project's programme, activities and outputs will be carried out via our schools' and Local Education Authorities' websites, notices, posters and meetings with staff and parents inside our schools.

We aim to increase the international dimension across our school and believe that this will improve our pupils' chances in the labour market in the future.\r\n\r\nThrough our dissemination and exploitation plans, we hope that the lessons learned, both by the individual participants, and by our school as a whole, will be long-lasting and for the benefit of our whole school community.

The project will provide a good opportunity to take this discussion further and explore how their pedagogy has an impact on learning. \r\n\r\nIn order to do this we will undertake a number of pre-mobility activities; three staff will job-shadow colleagues in Finland; and they will then disseminate their learning to colleagues in our own school and those of our local collaborative.  We hope that the results of the project will be long-lasting for our school community.\r\n\r\nOur two main priorities for 2016-18 across school are to implement the Building Learning Power (BLP) initiative and to improve basic skills, particularly in writing.  These priorities include our provision for Early Years and children with Special Needs.  We strongly believe in the importance of continuing staff development and value the opportunities offered by the Erasmus+ programme.  A key part of our plan will be a visit by three members of staff (two teachers and a teaching assistant) to our partner school in Finland.  \r\n\r\nOur European Development Plan and the proposed mobilities are completely linked with our whole school priorities and focus in detail on the following aspects:\r\n\r\n1 Building Learning Power\r\nTo consider how learning takes place in a cross-curricular environment.\r\n\r\n2 Basic Skills\r\ni) Writing: our aim is to improve writing across school. Our staff will feedback about what they have learned from seeing a number of lessons in the Finnish school, and what happens in the kindergarten setting. We want to compare the levels of writing achieved at different ages in England and Finland; understand the teaching sequence in a unit of writing; and compare the teaching of grammar and punctuation;\r\nii) Maths: Staff on the job-shadowing visit will feedback to colleagues about the way maths is taught in Finland \u2013 including exploring how models and images are used to develop concepts; which calculation strategies are being used; the national Finnish strategy for the teaching of Maths and how schools implement this. One of the teachers whom we hosted last year is a Maths expert who has written text books in Finland. She gave us copies of her book and we are very keen to see her methods put into practice and we plan to pass on some of the ideas she uses to the rest of the staff.\r\niii) Foreign Language Learning: our two MFL specialists will be going on the job-shadowing visit.  They will share good ideas learned with the rest of our colleagues.\r\niv) IT: We are looking to develop further our use of IT across the curriculum and have recently invested in ipads. The feedback session to all staff will include information about how IT, including computers and tablets, is used in the Finnish school.  We will feedback about how IT is integrated across the curriculum in Finland.  Our eTwinning project will be part of our work to feedback to colleagues and our pupils about our visit and what we have learned from the Finnish school. \r\nv) Music: The Finnish school has outstanding music provision and we hope to learn valuable ideas from them.\r\n\r\n3 Early Years\r\nWe will visit a kindergarten to explore how early learning is organised in Finland, including outdoor learning.\r\n\r\n4 Special Needs\r\nWe intend to research SEND provision in the Finnish school.\r\n\r\n5 Staff development\r\nThe project provides a fantastic opportunity for the individual professional development of participants, to broaden pupils' experiences  and to contribute to the school's culture and development.   \r\n\r\n6 The European Dimension\r\nWe hope that this project will lead to greater participation over the next few years in further eTwinning projects by more members of our school staff and possibly further Erasmus+ job-shadowing.\r\n\r\nThrough our dissemination and exploitation plans, we hope that the lessons learned, both by the individual participants, and by our school as a whole, will be long-lasting and for the benefit of our whole school community.  In addition, many of our dissemination strategies involve local, regional, national and international target audiences and we therefore hope that our work will be of wider benefit.", "http://www.eastburn.bradford.sch.uk", "Eastburn Junior and Infant School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035574_coordinator"]]}}}}
