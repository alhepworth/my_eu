Currently, the school follows a bi-weekly model whereby the MFL coordinator delivers one lesson with the class teacher present, followed by a lesson taught by the class teacher independently. Our current school development plan includes developing global links and citizenship ensuring that children respect other cultures and religions, through an increased inclusion of global citizenship in curriculum planning and teaching. By 2017 Bangabandhu aims to ensure that every KS2 teacher is capable of delivering quality language lessons using as much target language as possible with correct pronunciation and increased confidence. Global links and understanding will also be incorporated into every KS2 year group's curriculum planning and teaching.KS2 classroom teachers have been identified as key participants as they play a key role in planning and teaching language and topic lessons. Following a language skills and confidence audit, it is apparent that most of these teachers have little or no prior knowledge of Spanish and do not feel confident teaching it and developing cross-curricular links. As there is a high turn-over of staff, including a high number of NQTs in KS2, these teachers will need to be given the opportunity to develop their language competency and teaching methodology. We aim to send six teachers on teacher week-long mobility for training per academic year (2016-2018). Prior to mobility, teachers will participate in Spanish language twilight training sessions to prepare those who are going. This will enable them to fully benefit from the immersion experience that they will have in Spain. On return from the week long mobility participants will engage in follow-up sessions to consolidate the experience, develop action plans and put them into practice. The immediate results will be seen in the improved quality of Spanish lessons being taught in KS2. Teachers will have a better knowledge of the language and culture and more confidence in speaking Spanish. They will also have a better knowledge of different methods of delivering these lessons. As a result of this project the school will take part in a number of linked projects with twinned schools which will develop their global awareness and European dimension. Following this training participating teachers will be incorporating European links into their curriculum planning.

The representatives of each organization were challenged to give opportunity to youngsters to discuss their problems and find potential solutions. After this, one youngster joined the second phase of the LTTC and established partnerships at an international level. This project is a result of the involved youngsters work and, for this, a true Transnational Youth Initiative. The partners share the same problem, i.e., not only there is a lack of understanding between youth and older generation, but also the youth is not active in intergenerational aspects in local communities and at EU levels.OBJECTIVES- To create a new communication channel among youth and elderly people; - To equip youth workers, leaders and coaches with knowledge, methodology and skills to cope with intergenerational learning;- To create an entrepreneurial spirit among the youth to become more active citizens;- To create conditions and strengthen communication for youth and youth workers to become leaders who would focus on intergenerational issues within local communities;- To build a network of European Youth, who will share best practices.PARTICIPANTSThe target groups of this project are youngsters (16-30 years old) and youth workers.ACTIVITIESThere will be sessions, which purpose is for youngsters and elderly people to share experiences. Youngsters will learn skills and will be empowered by using other community resources. The topics thought by them to include in the sessions are hobbies; dating; music; movies; cooking; board games; among others. The youngsters will make video diaries during the planning and implementation of the sessions, to explore the relationship created between them and elderly people and to develop and improve technological skills.At the end of the sessions, there will be an exhibition. The main goal is to exhibit the final conclusions with pictures of the elderly people when young (and youngsters) and discourses and storytelling from the sessions. The aim of the training course is to give tools to youth workers, not only about the best practices on the intergenerationality topic, but also how to empower the youngsters while they prepare the sessions, implement and evaluate them. The youth workers will develop social and cultural competences and share good practices at EU level. The blended mobility of young people allows the youngsters to have parallel virtual sessions that will match the ones planned in the pension house. They will have the opportunity to share ideas in the preparation phase or will evaluate the session and share the experience with the other participants. After, they will know each other face-to-face and share the experiences and what they learnt over the sessions with elder people. The first transnational meeting is a kickoff meeting to establish ground rules. The second transnational meeting will happen to check project progress and activities taken place at local level so far. Finally, the third transnational meeting will be the time to checking the progress of current activities and to discuss a sustainable strategy for the project.METHODOLOGYThe methodology will be participative, peer-to-peer and non-formal methods. RESULTS- Increased social dialogue between youth and the elderly, through a new communication channel;- Increased knowledge and empowerment among youth, youth workers, leaders, trainers and coaches of intergenerational learning and social responsibility; - Youth more aware about intergenerational issues and their citizenship in this topic;- Network of youth for sharing of best practices in intergenerational learning;IMPACTSYOUTH:- Increased social-relational well-being, feeling of belonging and identification with local community; - Increased participation of youth on topics of development of local community;- Increased self-empowerment on practices and contexts of active citizenship.YOUTH WORKERS:- Improved knowledge and competences on approaches and tools of intergenerational learning; - Increased capability to activate engagement processes on youth in other fields (politic participation, voluntarism).PARTNER ORGANISATIONS:-  Increased quality of youth work activities;- Increased capacity to cooperate at EU level and to enhance international strategies.LONG TERM BENEFITSThis project allows building and sharing best practices and developing solutions related to intergenerational topics and a possibility to build an EU network of youth who become active in intergenerational issues.

The partnership has the following specific objectives:\r\n1: to create an online platform for sharing best practice among peer-to-peer education specialists and engage stakeholders from youth work, formal education and employment sectors from across Europe via this platform in order to increase understanding of the effectiveness of peer-to-peer education\r\n2: to develop effective and engaging pedagogical methods for structuring employment-related peer-to-peer-learning courses for young people\r\n3: to develop effective methods for engaging NEET young people in peer-to-peer-education\r\n4: to create the \u2018Share-to-Know Network\u2019 of European expert practitioners in peer-to-peer learning in order to support the adoption of effective methods and  online open education resources in peer-to-peer learning courses for NEET young people\r\n5: to improve impact measurement and evaluation techniques for peer-to-peer education initiatives\r\n6: to develop effective recognition/accreditation tools for informal learning achievements \r\nThe partnership consists of 3 organisations from the formal education, informal education and youth work sectors, with significant expertise in implementing employment-related peer-to-peer courses with NEET young people. In the course of the project, the partnership will come together for 6 transnational meetings featuring expert exchanges between partnership members and external stakeholders on peer-to-peer education methods, youth engagement methods, building partnerships with employers, locally accepted accreditation tools, impact measurement and sustainable business models. During the transnational meetings innovative methods in these areas will be identified and integrated via a real-world prototyping process into the ongoing learning operations of the partners, in order to test and evaluate their transferability and effectiveness. Following an editing and feedback process involving external stakeholders, the evaluation reports on the prototypes will be collated into the peer-to-peer education practitioners manual. Based on the current participants of the partner organisations, it is expected that of the 240 young learners, participating in the prototypes, at least 200 will be NEET. Alongside the prototyping schedule, the partnership will initiate and build up the Share-to-Know Network. During the 6 planned multiplier events, at least 270 representatives of peer-to-peer education practitioners and stakeholders from youth work organisations, informal and formal education providers, education policy makers and employer-representatives from across Europe, and in particular from countries with high youth unemployment and rates of NEET young people, will be engaged. A larger group of European stakeholders will be engaged via the Share-to-Know website, Network-newsletters, social media channels and the 5 webinars during the transnational meetings.\r\nThe partnership will produce a range of good practice guidance and innovative tools on all areas vital to the implementation of peer-to-peer education with NEET young people. The topics will be the engagement of NEET young people in peer-to-peer education, effective peer-to-peer education methods in employment-related courses, locally accepted accreditation and partnerships with employers, effective impact measurement for peer-to-peer education and a collection of case studies on sustainable business models for peer-to-peer education initiatives. The partnership will also create the online Share-to-Know website as a publishing and networking platform for relevant resources, news, online learning events (webinars) and networking opportunities from the partnership as well as external stakeholders. All engaged stakeholders who are already practicing peer-to-peer education or are interested in engaging with it, will be invited to join the Share-to-Know Network, which will help disseminate good practice, connect stakeholders from across Europe and raise the profile of peer-to-peer education.

Workforce demand has changed, rising unemployment and underemployment specially in youth collective. Although the rates of some countries as UK (12%) and Poland (15,2%) are lower than the rates of the EU28 (17,9%), other countries as Greece (45,2%) and Spain (42,2%) still being high and represent a big challenge for the public authorities and for the society in general.\r\n\r\nYoung persons who stay unemployed or underemployed for long periods have a higher risk of being in this category, suffering economic exclusion and provoking his/her exclusion from the labour market in adulthood. Eurofound reports (2015) said that many young people within countries are at greater risk than others, and there is a particular need to focus on the most disadvantaged and furthest from the labour market. The general approach is to regard young people as assets rather than problems, and to work with them in responding to their interests, as well as their needs, whilst seeking to capitalise on their creative and innovative capacities. So, it\u2019s necessary to promote (EC \u2013 Expert group report 2016) the soft competences that will deal with the new requirements of labour market together with some technical skills to enhance their insertion in the labour market.\r\n\r\nTo address youth unemployment, young people need to access to training that promotes competences and skills required by new and future social and economic challenges. Ageing society, rise of smart systems as well as globally connected worlds are (among others) new components of the labour market that require specific key and transversal skills as: social intelligence, trans-disciplinary, design mindset and cross-cultural competences (among others).\r\n\r\nThese new drivers and emerging skills have a direct clear impact in social entrepreneurship ecosystem. The rapid growth in social enterprise businesses is one such way to do this, allowing young people direct access to the jobs market in an environment that puts their development at its heart. Social businesses spur cooperation between the public sector, civil society, private business and the education sector - cooperation that can help create new employment opportunities through education, training schemes or practical work experience. Thus, training for social entrepreneurship opportunity represent the suitable framework to develop these emerging competences creating a disruptive innovation in the learning map.\r\n\r\nThus, GATES project main objective is to enhance the employability of young people and their position in the labour market, addressing these fresh competences and skills in the framework of social entrepreneurship through game based learning.\r\nIn order to achieve this main objective, project aims to:\r\n- Implement a knowledge map that includes these emerging (and required) competences in social entrepreneurship ecosystem;\r\n- Develop a new pedagogical methodology based on games to promote future skills in of workforce landscape and social entrepreneurship;\r\n- Build an informal, open and collaborative environment that supports learning and facilitates knowledge and ideas sharing, while promoting joint entrepreneurship activities (peer-mentoring approach); \r\n- Create a critical mass on project topic and involve different actors, enhancing the multi stakeholder approach.\r\nGATES project beneficiaries are young workers who need to improve emerging key and transversal skills - in the framework of this project we can define \u201cyoung workers\u201d as all workers between 18 and 23 years employed and unemployed (we limited the age because by 2020 they have to deal with these emerging competences).\r\n\r\nThe project will start in December 2017 and will finish on May 2019 (18 months), and it will be implemented by 4 institutions of 4 different EU countries: Poland, Greece, Spain and UK.\r\n\r\nTotal cost of the project: 117.688 Euros.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-2-PL01-KA205-039199_2"]]}}, "9PJ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1522540800000, 1648684800000, "PARTICIPATORY MEMORY PRACTICES.

We believe that the involvement of volunteers will have a positive influence on the process of integration in general. Nevertheless language learning is a field of action were untrained volunteers need support, and should not be left alone.\r\n\r\nThis project will show innovative ways of how volunteers can be involved in language learning for refugees. The field of action will include \r\n- volunteering inside of the classroom side by side with teachers\r\n- volunteering as learning facilitators in extra-curricular activities\r\n\r\nIn order to encourage language teachers to collaborate with volunteers we will develop a TOOL KIT for TEACHERS and TRAINERS. Hands-on material, tips and tricks will support teachers in the cooperation with non-trained volunteers. This material will be tested in a series of pilot praxis projects within this project.\r\nA second TOOL-KIT will address VOLUNTEERS, and help them to find their place in language learning projects, and support them in their activities. This Tool-Kit will likewise be tested in pilot praxis projects.\r\nFinally a DIRECTORY for successful involvement of volunteers in language learning for refugees will help ORGANIZATIONS of all sizes to implement innovative volunteering projects.\r\n\r\nWe are convinced that the three involved parties (Trainers, Refugees, Volunteers) will benefit on a long term from such cooperation: \r\n\r\nTEACHER gain extra support inside and outside of the classroom. With a counterpart on their side, a more individual teaching is possible. The volunteers can overtake some activities within and outside of the classroom to further improve the learning success of the participants. The experience of this project will be adaptable also for other language classes.\r\n\r\nREFUGEES benefit from a more intensive way of language learning and most importantly get in touch with the society they now live in. Many times, newly arrived find it especially hard to practice outside of the classroom because they have no contact to native speakers (except for the teacher). Also, non-natives that already dominate the language on a high level can become valuable guides who have even more empathy for their situation.\r\n\r\nVOLUNTEERS are people who give their time and energy to help others.

The activities of each partner organisation, regardless of their differing foci, enable each volunteer to connect issues of racism, discrimination and prejudice through providing support for people with fewer opportunities. Each organisation also has historical links, or is influenced by European history, helping volunteers to appreciate the effects of racism, discrimination and what can happen if people are excluded from society, a theme that very much remains relevant in contemporary Europe. \r\nVolunteers at the Aegis Trust, Jewish Museum and Wiener Library contribute to pedagogical programmes, often with local, European and international school classes, contributing their own historical perspectives and views on contemporary Europe. The diverse range of groups involved with these three hosting organisations brings the volunteers into contact with young people from different social and cultural backgrounds, enabling them to demonstrate that a voluntary service is a very productive activity, regardless of where one comes from.

The participation of employees has special attention because in the past the participation of employees within Erasmus lagged relative to the students. We looked for diversity and new initiatives. In Mondrian More Mobilities we want to send the entire management for an internship abroad.\r\nStudents Erasmus+ program works efficiently. The school plans activity from the curriculum. Its implementation may be abroad and we are thankful for the grant opportunity.\r\n\r\nFor employees, it is difficult. Of course professionalisation is planned but the question of a  course abroad or in house is not yet commonly asked. Especially when Erasmus+ funding can be involved. In the construction phase, the \"delay\" of waiting for the next call takes too much time. Waiting for a wanted course is no good for professionalisation.\r\nWe get many requests from abroad to assist in a particular topic unexpectedly. Naturally Mondrian used its own resources. But for the further development and consciousness we would be able to mention this kind of requests in te application in  such a way that it fits in the subsidy program without being very specific. Over time, it will be like when students work with specific partners. The amount of courses by Mondrian makes it difficult to realize such application, certainly in the beginning.", "http://www.mirjamrouden.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA116-035042_7"], [2016, "Mondriaan European Experience Three: International Natural Gathering", "Mirjam Rouden Ltd", 90142.0, 7, 16, "MEETING, the new Erasmus + project ROC Mondriaan, is the follow-up of project MEE. MEETING stands for Mondrian European Experience Three, International Natural Gathering: to meet, to come together, to learn from each other. MEETING has expanded the number of mobilities, and more importantly, more schools are connected. Internationalization is a priority at ROC Mondriaan!ROC Mondriaan (1.950 employees) is the VET Institution in the The Hague region which offers vocational and adult education to approximately 21.000 students. It promotes employment and/or social participation of its students. Mondrian has written its internationalization program in the policy document \"Mondrian local as well as global\". The policy consists of three main parts: 1. The Hague International City, 2. International orientation of schools, including the overseas internships and 3. Exchange programs. The strategic ambitions 2016 - 2019 of our institute include explicitly an international orientation as well; the themes \"Improvement of education quality\" and \"Promoting/encouraging innovation and global citizenship\" have both an international perspective.In this project, Mondriaan wants to stimulate individual experience abroad and embed international activities in the organization. Our overall objectives are:- to develop international competencies- to broaden horizons and prospects- personal development- to improve foreign languages- to gain inspiration, motivation and knowledge by staffThe mobilitiesCare and Welfare / Estonia 20 students BBLIn Estonia our partners demand a possible solution on a specific case. Out students will work on this topical issue for two weeks. The students present the possible solution and will engage the employees to implement the new method.Nursing & Care / Spain 34 studentsOur Nursing students go on a 20 weeks internship, Our car students go on a 12 weeks internship.

And which is almost impossible to experience in the Netherlands.Technique / Malta, Ireland 24 studentsThese students do a 12-week internship in Malta or Ireland. In Malta they follow a language training one day a week and follow an approved apprenticeship four days a week. In Ireland they go intern at an IT company to make a full apprenticeship.Lifestyle, Sport and Exercise / Austria 10 studentsStudents go on an internship for three weeks in Austria.

They will acquire knowledge, visit schools and exchange experiences with colleagues. The program of all individual training / study trips is compiled based on the learning needs of the employee and / or training.All participants will have an unforgettable experience: an experience abroad deepens knowledge and provides new insights and inspiration. The internship contributes to the autonomy, self-reliance and personal responsibility of students and employees. They acquire a better knowledge of a foreign language, move in a completely different context than they\u2019re used to and therefore it will deliver a wealth of experience and a better perspective on the labor market. Together with our partners we are building a European network for proper placement and knowledge exchange. The internships abroad are means to embed Internationalization in a structural way. It will connect the international labor market and is a way to present the schools attractively. The Hague region has a large international business field and with the structural embedding of our internationalization policy, we are an interesting partner for the regional labor market.", "http://www.mirjamrouden.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NL01-KA102-022798_13"], [2015, "Mondriaan European ExperienceTwee", "Mirjam Rouden Ltd", 72001.0, 7, 14, "MEET, Mondriaan European Experience Two will succeed the mobility project MEE of ROC Mondriaan. MEET will broaden and expand European internships and is an important component of the recently formulated Internationalization Policy.\r\nROC Mondriaan (1900 employees) is the VET Institution in the The Hague region which offers vocational education to approximately 18.000 students. It promotes employment and / or social participation of its students. Besides a concern for the \u2018basics\u2019 there is a focus on the \u2018exceptional\u2019 with explicit attention to innovation. For the period 2015 - 2019 an internationalization policy has been written: \"ROC Mondriaan local as well as global\". With this firmly stated policy agenda, ROC Mondriaan has taken a step forward in streamlining and embedding existing international activities and the expansion of international exchanges and internships.\r\nThe general objectives are for students to: \r\n\u2022 promote and increase their European horizons \r\n\u2022 increase their perspective on labour markets\r\n\u2022 expand skills and learn to apply them in other contexts\r\n\u2022 develop more independency and self-reliance\r\n\u2022 gain a better knowledge of foreign languages such as English, Spanish and German\r\nand for our employees to:\r\n\u2022 gain new motivation, inspiration and knowledge, so they can transfer the latest know-how and developments, and the importance of international experiences to their students.\r\nPlanned mobilities: \r\nCare and Wellbeing / Estonia: 20 bbl students (learners in companies) \r\nThe project in Estonia is a stable one. Students take on assignments to improve living conditions of clients in various institutions. Because of their work bbl students can stay on an internship up to 2 weeks. The impact of the training is not only of importance for the students, but also for the Estonian partners, as new methods and skills are implemented.\r\nNursing / Spain: 20 students\r\nNursing students gain more specialized knowledge, perform more nursing activities and have a greater responsibility than on internships in the Netherlands. The students do a four-month internship in (specialist) clinics such as rehabilitation, infertility, cardiovascular surgery.\r\nTourism and Recreation / Spain: 20 students Travel / Germany: 20 students Front Office\r\nWe want our students to think and act across Dutch borders. Therefore Intercultural communication is high on the agenda. Knowledge of another culture, hospitality as well as the compulsory learning of a second language are essential. In this context, students are immersed in the German or Spanish language and culture through training and business assignments. The underlying objective for the mobility to Germany is to improve the image of our students with regard to Germany, the Germans and the German language.\r\nTechnology / Malta: 24 students\r\n4 schools of Engineering want to introduce European internships among their students.  Malta has been chosen because of the possibilities in all four areas of technology and the fact that in Malta, besides English, an Arabic dialect is spoken. This can be an additional motivation due to the background of many students. Aims for our students to participate in this project include:   obtaining independence and acquiring more self-reliance, undergoing cultural differences, improving cooperation, getting a broader view and realizing that the labour market is larger than that of the Netherlands.\r\nFashion / England and Turkey: 8 students\r\nAlmost all textile production takes place abroad. Our students will get acquainted with the production process in this 15-week European internship. When looking for a job it\u2019s a great advantage for a student being able to prove having been on a work placement abroad. Precisely because the fashion industry has an international scope.\r\nStaff\r\n16 employees will be given the opportunity of a foreign internship/training to develop and to learn about other learning systems and innovative developments. For now, the planned mobilities are related to employees whose students go on an European internship. The goal is to gain new insights and inspiration, build contacts and share experience within the organization, also in order to inspire other colleagues to participate in the Erasmus + program.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of students and staff will be shared within their own schools through presentations, throughout the organization via the Intranet and workshops during a symposium. Experiences will be shared with the entire class by means of keeping a blog and presentations. They will take place after students and staff are returned, but we will try to do this also during the internship of students through Skype.\r\nWith this project we expect to make an important contribution to perpetuating internationalization. We expect that our newly acquired insights will enable us even more to link up with labour market developments and the international field of the Haaglanden region and the city of The Hague as the International City of Peace and Justice.", "http://www.mirjamrouden.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NL01-KA102-008674_13"]]}}}}
