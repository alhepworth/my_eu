It will include 2 flows of 21 students each for 13 weeks of stay per flow.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of teachers will consist on job-shadowing about Dual Vocational Training in Germany and England. It will include two flows of 6 participants each for 1 week stay per flow (one flow will go to Germany and the other to England).\r\n\r\nThe IES Virgen de las Nieves is willing to share its experiences with centres of other European countries and learn from these centres. The objective of this activity is that teachers aquire knowledge about training programmes, administrative management, monitoring strategies, etc. used in other countries. \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve educational improvement it is essential the existence of evaluation and dissemination proceedings of those experiences contributing to the acquisition of competences by the students. This project is a good opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\nThe project will consist of two flows of 6 teachers and professionals lasting one week each. The period planned would not influence on the normal running of lessons in the IES, since in that period (April-May) an important number of students would be doing their internship at companies (FCT) so that it would be easier to replace these teachers in that period.\r\n\r\nRegarding the profile of the teachers, they have great experience in the development of European educational projects. The two flows would visit two very important European countries in terms of Dual Vocational Training, such as: England and Germany.\r\n\r\nRegarding the activity for students, the mobility will take place in Italy in the city of Palermo, Sicily. IESVN is planning to send a total of 42 students and 2 accompanying teachers, divided into two flows of 13 weeks each. Each flow will have 21 students (3 students for each of  the 7 specialties: Motor vehicle electromechanics; Carpentry and furniture; Manufacture and installation of carpentry and furniture; Consumer equipment; Electromechanical Maintenance; Installation and maintenance of machinery and electromechanical driving lines and Machining (industrial maintenance and mechanics) and there will be one accompanying teacher for each flow (for the first and last week of stay).\r\n\r\nIn case that the project is approved, this school would take part as a sending organisation in the Erasmus + project, therefore, it is a major challenge for this organisation to ensure the quality of this project, and for that reason, it has a team of teachers and members of the management team available to it and dedicated to helping in every way possible. In addition, in the host country the IESVN has the help and collaboration of diffefferent intermediary and host organisations which will help the IESVN in everything that might be necessary.\r\n\r\nIESVN will always have direct control over the project and will be in charge of coordinating and checking all aspects of the project from its drafting to its justification. \r\nIESVN firmly believes that its partners can help them to organise the Erasmus + project in a reliable and professional way, helping IESVN with the organization of basic services such as accommodation, training programme,  local transport and additional services that will enrich the project, for example some cultural and pedagogical training activities.\r\n\r\nThe students of IESVN work very hard to obtain a training that will allow them to improve their socio-economic situation and to find a job in this difficult economic crisis situation. Nowadays, it is necessary to have work experience to find a job, yet the young people that are finishing their professional training at IESVN still do not have it. Furthermore, we believe that practical training in another European country will multiply their chances of accessing the labour market and it will also be an opportunity to learn and speak in another language, something which is considered as essential to find a job. The main aim of the project is to give the students a beneficial experience that will help them both in their personal life and in their professional life in the future.\r\nThroughout this European experience and period of training abroad, the participants will increase their chances to find a high quality job.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the staff training will positively return to the IESVN through the quality in the training delivered to students.", "http://www.colchester.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA102-014457_2"], [2015, "\u201cPr\u00e1cticas Innovadoras en Europa en Carrocer\u00eda, Instalaciones El\u00e9ctricas y Autom\u00e1ticas, Sistemas Microinform\u00e1ticos y Redes y Conducci\u00f3n de Actividades F\u00edsicas en el Medio Natural: En Busca de un Futuro Mejor\u201d", "COLCHESTER INSTITUTE", 128259.0, 4, 15, "The Secondary School \"IES Polit\u00e9cnico Hermenegildo Lanz\" in Granada submits this Erasmus + Project for VET learners in companies and staff training abroad in order to increase their training and competences, to open a range of new working possibilities and to create a collaborative network that increases the  awareness of European citizenship. \r\n\r\nThis project includes 3 different activities: one for Vocational Training Teachers, another one for Basic Vocational Training students (FPB) and the last one for Initial Vocational Training students (FPGM). \r\n\r\nTeachers will carry out the mobility activity during one week in the city of Leipzig, Germany, in order to know the educational system and specifically, how the Dual Vocational Training is developed there, and the business environment, as well as to establish a collaborative network with partners for future collaboration. The activity for teachers will consist of job shadowing in educational institutions and internship companies to see how the German educational system works. These institutions will be related to Vocational Training, which has great prestige in Germany.   \r\n\r\nThe stay of Basic Vocational Training students (FPB) will last three weeks and it will take place in Italy.

The project plans the mobility of 10 participants of Initial Vocational Training and 10 participants of Basic Vocational Training divided into two flows during the academic year 2016/2017 and 2017/2018. The School also wants to send 14 teachers divided into two flows, one per year, for job-shadowing activities in a Vocational Training School.The duration of the stay for students of Basic Vocational training will be three weeks, the first year in Portugal and the second one in Italy, both starting in March and accompanied by a teacher. These students come from three different specialities, so the internships will be related to the field of IT, Vehicle Repair and Electrical Installations. Regarding the students of Initial Vocational Training, there are four specialties included in the project. The mobility of the specialties of Vehicle Body Work, Electrical and Automatic Installations as well as Microcomputer Systems and Networks will last for 11 weeks starting in March, and the destinations will be Italy, Germany and Ireland respectively. With respect to the specialty of Outdoor Physical Activities, the mobility will last 9 weeks and it will start in October, the destination being Italy.     The internships will be completed as a part of the module of Training at the Workplace, providing students with the possibility to know a different professional, linguistic and cultural context.Regarding the staff mobility, it includes job-shadowing activities that will last one week and will be carried out bewteen March and April in Colchester. The staff includes Vocational Training Teachers or members of the managing board in charge of VET organisation.
