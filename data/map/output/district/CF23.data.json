At systemic level, we expect to awaken a modernisation of education.  \r\n\r\nThrough this project we will engage and widen the school community and reinforce our response to the main challenges of today's world in particular active participation in democratic life by realising and owning change. \r\n\r\nSchools will be developed as Learning & Thinking centres of excellence from which the wider community can play an important role in the educational standards of our young learners. By combining life skills with thinking skills and vision for the future we will inspire engagement thus raising standards amongst our pupils especially those who are considered disadvantaged.  Through these actions we will support schools in tackling lack of engagement which often leads to early school leaving. In addition we will engage local businesses to help support our local communities in gaining the appropriate skills set.\r\n\r\nWe have a combined  vision with regard to empowering and supporting  achievement amongst young people, their families and the wider community. This vision is applicable to all and will underpin all activities in order that all participants achieve their full potential.  We want to demonstrate the value that can be created when teachers give young people the practical skills to solve real challenges be.\r\n\r\nThe plan has 3 strands:\r\nStrand 1 - Upskilling Teachers, Pupils and Engaging the Community\r\nIn the initial stages of our project we upskill teachers in effective Thinking Skills in the classroom.\r\nAs this project will be largely led by pupils the next stage will be to upskill pupils in essential thinking skills.\r\nOnce trained pupils will approach members of the wider community to look at ways in which they can improve their locality and identify the skills they need in order to meet their goals.  \r\nWe have included job-shadowing and training for teachers.\r\nStrand 2- Developing Leaning & Thinking Together (LTT) schools\r\nOnce the required skill set is identified we will put into place the necessary intergenerational community training programmes in which pupils will disseminate their new skills and gaining additional skills by engaging in these events.  Wherever possible local businesses and entrepreneurs will be included sharing their expertise and offering work experience opportunities to older students. We will involve families from the school community and the wider community.\r\nTraining events will be held within the participating schools and the community will be encouraged to come together in intergenerational learning and making progress towards our goal of developing participating schools as LTT centres of excellence.\r\nTeachers from partner schools will take part in job-shadowing and pupils will take part in pupil exchange visits to partner countries. \r\nStrand 3 - Action Community Project\r\nIn this final part of the project schools will work together with the wider communities to put into play the actions they have deemed important and necessary for the wellbeing of pupils and residents in the local area. \r\nA focus will be put on the skills learned by pupils and the participating adults.  \r\nOnce complete the projects will be disseminated in multiplier events in each region.  These events will serve as a celebration of the good practice shared but also a further opportunity to encourage other schools in our regions to engage in similar activities.\r\nThere is no doubt that by cooperating together and sharing skills, experiences and competences between the partner regions the project outcomes will be significantly reinforced.

For the upcoming years, we are going to focus on involving consortium employees, since the role of teacher/coach is significant in the student\u2019s decision to go abroad, which is established in a recent study done by consortium, please find attached. It therefore seems that the ambition to expand internationalisation is related to employees who have experience with going abroad, since they act as ambassadors in favour of internationalisation and thus enthuse students and colleagues alike to participate in an international activity. \r\nOur HR policy is always aimed at professionalising employees and internationalisation is one of the tools that we use to enhance this, for instance by offering a language course or a specialised training to our employees. Not only does a foreign experience add to the employees\u2019 knowledge but it also adds to personal educational ideas and educational development put within a wider European perspective. Naturally the foreign experience should be used as an asset to develop either the educational team or an educational element. \r\nAnother goal for the upcoming year is to focus on incorporating internationalisation within the HR policy. We are going to implement internationalisation in both PDP conversations and year evaluations and it will be noted in our team plans. Employees are expected to clearly account for their learning goals in the document \u2018Work programme VETPRO\u2019 before leaving, since by doing so the foreign experience is secured within the educational team and/or element. Moreover, the manager is going to sign the document \u2018Work programme VETPRO\u2019 beforehand. The document will then become a part of the digital tool and will be added to the employee\u2019s file. \r\nAs is mentioned above the teacher/coach plays a significant role in the students\u2019 decision process, and therefore the steering committee is going to inform teachers/coaches better in the upcoming Call about the possibilities within internationalisation. The first time that consortium organised a meeting was in 2016 and involved every member of the internationalisation working groups from three ROCs, hence these meetings are going to take place in the upcoming years as well. The head committee is going to provide better information to teachers/coaches by help of the working group members; in which they are aided by an informational leaflet and the website of consortium that is in development. In addition to this the head committee wants to offer courses, such as the IOA course or NUFFIC courses to employees who fulfil an active role within internationalisation.\r\nIn short 'staff awareness for internationalisation' means:\r\n- the results of a foreign experience will be secured by the 'work programme VETPRO', endorsed by the manager.\r\n- improved information for teachers/coaches.\r\n- offering sources regarding internationalisation.\r\nThe Erasmus+ 2016 System Check proved that the consortium used all kinds of documents to account for the grant. The steering committee decided to develop a digital tool in which everyone uploads and files the same documents. Spring 2017 there will be a pilot using the tool and it will be deployed simultaneously starting from the school year 2017/2018.\r\nIn the context of quality improvement we would like to come to more in-depth agreements with our preferred partners. In 2017 the consortium is going to organise a meeting with our preferred partners in order to agree on the following: student exchange based on ECVET, job shadowing, incoming and outgoing mobility and management exchange.\r\nOur level 1 and 2 students have often never been abroad, but increasingly participate\r\nin foreign experiences.

It is obvious that each institute will keep its own identity, but working together will strengthen each institute with respect to the theme of internationalisation. The consortium also formulated targets to monitor the desired collective goals. These targets will enable us to determine whether we are on course annually.The consortium closed Call 2013 last year. After closing Call 2013 the number of students making use of the subsidy appeared to have increased. In the current situation of Call 2014, we expect a further increase of students. The increasing number of participants seems to be a trend. For this reason we will apply for more subsidy for more students and staff.The consortium formulated some goals for students and staff for the application of Call 2015. These goals will remain in full force in Call 2016. In the next Call we will try to realize these goals. These goals fit in with the formulated shared objectives namely:- Outbound mobility staff:  offering collective study trips abroad.
