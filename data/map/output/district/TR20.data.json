The reason we chose Denmark is because although children begin their formal education at a later age than those in the UK, they overtake us academically by the time they reach the age of 16. We will study the reasons for this by visiting the schools and observing the teaching styles in pre-primary and primary schools and their impact upon pupil progress comparing to UK. We will also study the transition from pre-primary to primary school and how this is managed effectively in Denmark. We will do this by shadowing headteacher, school administration staff and learning support assistants and how pupils respond to the strategies used in the classroom and outdoors, such as teaching styles and resources. We will closely observe how the key competencies are taught and the impact of these teaching stay;es on pupils learning and achievement. We will also closely observe how the they narrow the gap in attainment for disadvantaged children and those with special educational needs and disabilities via teaching styles, support assistants and resources.\r\nThe expected impact is to raise attainment of pupils in key competencies by the age of 11 by implementing a variety of learned strategies from an early age and to enhance the professional development of all staff in achieving this target.", "http://www.germoe.cornwall.sch.uk", "Germoe Community Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002024_coordinator"]]}}}}
