This vocational training period has to be completed in order to pass the European standard BTECH diploma in Cookery and Catering, and provides the students with a mobility opportunity abroad, an opening into European Multicultural Citizenship and development of their vocational and linguistic skills. These students, who are registered in the second year of the three year European B Tech, in the Cookery, Service and Restaurant modules have already undertaken a first year Vocational BTECH. They comprise 2 classes of 24 students.  The first group will go to work placements in Europe in September 2014, the second group will have their training period in March - April 2015, The next class, of 48 students, will be divided in half so 24 will be sent in September - October 2015 and the others 24 in March - April 2016. In total 96 students, both boys and girls will benefit from these mobilities. The pupils are often quite young and some have challenging social backgrounds. The financial support from Erasmus+ contributes to a good quality, well-structured training opportunity.Since 2004, we have been building a network of receiving hotels in Ireland, Scotland and Estonia and have worked hard to establish these contacts. These European countries were chosen for ease of access from France, The receiving partners are all high quality hotels and restaurants.The aim of our students is to pass their Vocational B TECH and to obtain the Europass certificate. After being prepared for the mobility, the students, travelling in pairs, are supervised and monitored by our local partners. The receiving hotels or resturaants keep in touch with the tutor in charge of the project. Teachers from the Lyc\u00e9e visit to assess the trainee. The budget is established taking into account Erasmus funding, the contribution of partner companies, the Lyc\u00e9e, family and a financial grant from the Region Ile de France. The activities and results of the project are widely disseminated in newspapers, and websites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivity 2: Consists of a 5 month European mobility which is suitable for students who have just passed a diploma in the Cookery and Catering sector and having now a CAP, a Vocational B TECH or a Technology BTECH. They are enrolled in a complementary local initiative training - FCIL: Adaptability to Cooking and Catering Trade in Europe and Abroad (Adaptation aux M\u00e9tiers de l'H\u00f4tellerie en Europe et \u00e0 l'International).Our participants are mainly from the Paris area and they come from modest social backgrounds. They require financial and an organisational help. Our aims are to prepare our students to adapt to diverse cultural and vocational situations to enrich their lives. This project aims to further their vocational and social integration into the world of work and to familiarize them with applying a Lifelong Learning training. At our Lyc\u00e9e, our involvement in European programmes is part of the \"European and International Opening\" axis of our school project. This international dimension is likely to enhance our desirability in terms of recruitment and employability, contributing to the excellent reputation of our training and enhance the positive image of our school. Our project is supported by the strong C.H.A.S.E Network (Consortium of Hospitality and Accommodation Schools Schools of Europe) which is now of 24 years standing and has 14 partner catering schools or institutions located in 13 European countries: Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Finland , Ireland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, and Turkey. It is thanks to this network that the mobility projects can be realised; the wide range of European destinations has a strong attraction for students wanting to participate. In order to coordinate our activities, improve communication and to make long-lasting partnerships, a annual meeting is organized where we decide on a joint focus for the project e,g, this year we chose: Awareness of Health and Nutrition in the Cookery and Catering sector in Europe, The mobilities last for five months. During the first 4 weeks there is a period of cultural and linguistic training to prepare the students for their internships in hotels or restaurants. During the four months internship students are accommodated in the hotel or in nearby hostels or apartments. Students have a nominated supervisor in the hotel or restaurant placements and are also monitored by a tutor from the receiving partner and from the Lyc\u00e9e, the sending organisation.

Children in Permaculture (CiP) is a unique, highly innovative project based on a genuine needs analysis about how to teach those values to children from an early age.\r\n\r\nWe have carefully selected an enthusiastic and dedicated team to take forward our application, some of whom have worked together in EU projects, and some have never met before, and yet have found over the last few months developing this project, how well they work together.

To identify, develop and test CiP best practices resources (curricula, lesson plans, activities and other resources) with 17+ educators of children aged 3-12 years in the 5 partner countries. \r\n2. To improve competences and skills in outdoor permaculture education, intercultural awareness and sustainability of up to 150 school and kindergarten teachers/assistants.\r\n3. To engage up to 250 children aged 3-6 years and 250 children 7-12 years in the 5 partners countries in opportunities to learn about the environment, climate change and sustainability.\r\n4.

To establish a European Children in Permaculture Network with 1000 educators throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nWe will create an online platform which will include a web front page with a user-friendly database to host CiP best practice resources. Then we will research existing resources about teaching permaculture to children aged 3-12 years, our findings will be published in a research paper also freely available online.\r\n\r\nAll the partners will take many photographs and short videos, write up their experience of sharing permaculture with children which will be published in case studies, and we will create a short film to enthuse and motivate others to follow our examples.\r\n\r\n17 experienced permaculture educators will be trained to share their knowledge and skills with children and teachers. They will train up to 150 primary and kindergarten teachers to embed permaculture ethics, principles & methods in their learning environments using the CiP Best Practices Resources created.\r\n\r\nThe 17 educators will develop and test CiP curricula, lesson plans, activities, handouts for children in key stages 1 and 2 which will be replicable throughout the EU, and make them available on the online platform. Other educators globally will be able to download and test these resources, give feedback, and suggest improvements, resulting in a long-term culture of learning, sharing, and improving with our online platform.

In line with the Scottish Government 1+2 languages policy, all pupils at Primary 1 should begin one modern language (French as per our local authority policy) and an additional language introduced at Primary 5.

I will attend the total immersion course as organised by LFEE to refresh my teaching skills and grammatical knowledge of Spanish as it is many years since I have used it properly and I need a refresher opportunity. Also I am lacking in resources, activities and ICT links for the teaching of Spanish to younger Primary aged pupils. The course is organised to provide intensive language training, opportunities to discuss methodology, provide resources and ideas for lessons, enable a cultural awareness with a focus on education systems. Upon return I will then be modeling teaching of Spanish within the classroom and organising a series of local training opportunities for classroom practitioners. These will be built in to the CPD calendar from August 2016 to enable staff to attend. I also aim to extend the training to colleagues at cluster, local area and authority wide level.

Pupils and staff will feel supported in the learning of languages as part of their daily routine. I will gain confidence to deliver int he classroom and support staff at various levels.
