Nanotechnology is a truly enabling technology, with unlimited potential for innovation. However, the novelty in properties and forms of NMs makes the development of a well-founded and robust legislative framework to ensure safe development of nano-enabled products particularly challenging. At the heart of the challenge lies the difficulty in the reliable and reproducible characterisation of NMs given their extreme diversity and dynamic nature, particularly in complex environments, such as within different biological, environmental and technological compartments. Two key steps can resolve this: 1) the development of a holistic framework for reproducible NM characterisation, spanning from initial needs assessment through method selection to data interpretation and storage; and 2) the embedding of this framework in an operational, linked-up ontological regime to allow identification of causal relationships between NMs properties, be they intrinsic, extrinsic or calculated, and biological, (eco)toxicological and health impacts fully embedded in a mechanistic risk assessment framework.  ACEnano was conceived in response to the NMBP 26 call with the aim to comprehensively address these two steps. More specifically ACEnano will introduce confidence, adaptability and clarity into NM risk assessment by developing a widely implementable and robust tiered approach to NM physico-chemical characterisation that will simplify and facilitate contextual (hazard or exposure) description and its transcription into a reliable NMs grouping framework.

This is due to the diversity of the jobs at hand and the influence of the managers in each team in this organisation of multi-national staff. The end objective is the glue that binds the teams as we strive to better the environment of the islands in general and protect birds in particular. Results will be assessed at the end of each quarter to determine if objectives are being met with the methodology used. Adjustments where necessary will be made to facilitate the process. Towards the end of the project, managers will discuss with their respective teams which areas have been successful and which need further development.\r\nThe aim of involving volunteers in our work is to expose them to environmental issues and situations, to give them the opportunity to participate in real vital work as opposed to teaching modules, instilling passion for the environment, which they will carry with them and instill in others. In the long term the benefits are twofold: the organisation will benefit from fresh new ideas and enthusiasm a new volunteer brings and the opportunity for the volunteer to put to practice what has been learnt in years of education, opening up new horizons for them and helping them along their career path. Some may even decide to specialize and return to full or part time education.\r\nThere is also the important factor of multiculturalism, as they work, live and socialize with other volunteers helping them understand, communicate and cooperate, benefiting  themselves and their respective communities.", "http://www.eiluk.org", null, "erasmus_2016-3-MT01-KA105-026808_3"], [2014, "Peacebuilding and Social Cohesion: positive about youth", "EIL LTD", 27402.0, 12, 14, "This Training Course for youth workers will bring together 48 people from 12 countries - Romania, Poland, Slovakia, Norway, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Denmark, Belgium, Germany, Spain and the UK.

There is a strong motivation for further improvement within the sector and there are a lot of significant efforts being done throughout Europe, on national, regional  and local  level, to enhance the quality and recognition of youth work. We believe that youth work can be better recognised by measuring its real impact and effects on young people's lives. Often, youth organisations focus on the quantitative and not on the qualitative outputs. In order though to ensure the credibility and the real value of youth work, a well developed quality assurance framework is needed. \r\n\r\n For this reason, the training course \"LevelUp!\" aims to gather youth workers, youth policy makers, youth educators and youth leaders in order to work through the exchange of best practices, experiences and expertise on the development of a common quality assurance framework that addresses certain needs of young people that have been identified in all the partner countries involved. They will then work in groups in order to adapt this framework to the real needs of the young people of their communities. Furthermore, new innovative digital and online tools will be shared and tested regarding the validation and recognition of youth work. \r\n\r\nWorking closely with youth organizations from different countries in Europe is an important objective of this training course so that a strong international network is built. Te topic of this training course is par excellence a matter about which we need to develop a quality assurance framework that can be effective at all levels; local, regional, national and international/European level.\r\n\r\n30 participants from Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Poland, Portugal, Spain and UK will meet first in Thessaloniki, Greece in September 2018 and work on the topics aforementioned. After the completion of the first activity in Thessaloniki, the partners and participants will provide their feedback on the effectiveness of the quality assurance framework and the digital tools for the validation of youth work through an evaluation system developed by JKPeV. Being based on their feedback and evaluation we will work further and develop the quality assurance framework and the online validation tools of youth work together in Dresden, Germany in November 2018. By running two activities instead of one, we will be able to disseminate better the results of our work, test these outputs and work further on improving them. The training course is designed for youth workers who are directly involved working with Erasmus+ projects.  We are going to develop a common quality assurance framework for youth work that aims to develop the quality of youth work and its impact on young people's lives. We trust that this training course will contribute to improving quality of Erasmus+ projects and development of competent youth and community workers internationally.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to explore the concepts and benefits of working on the quality of youth work by analysing and mapping the needs of young people from different communities, to use and test innovative online tools that validate youth work and to build a strong international network of youth organisations that aim to improve quality in youth work and their youth projects at local and European level. The participants and their organisations as a result:\r\n\u2022 will know how to define youth work and its role at local and European level;  \r\n\u2022 will learn why quality in youth work is so important in international youth and community work; \r\n\u2022 will share good practices and successful examples of quality in European youth and community projects;\r\n\u2022 will develop different tools and methodology for addressing issues of quality in youth work;\r\n\u2022 will develop a common quality assurance framework that aims to improve the quality of youth works and targeted projects' impact;\r\n\u2022 will use and test innovative online tools that validate youth work;\r\n\u2022 will build their international network so that new partnerships will be developed throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe training programme consists of 6 different types of activities:\r\n1.

While discussing important issues around effective dissemination of information, we discovered that animation offers new, powerful and much needed communication tools that can be easily embraced by any type of organizations and individuals. As such, animated content can easily be used: \r\n- as an educational tool (especially in training or teaching)\r\n- to ensure better dissemination, visibility and promotion of various causes\r\n- as a form of artistic expression (with therapeutic elements), when voicing out ones needs, etc. \r\n\r\nAIM and OBJECTIVES: \r\n\r\nInspired by the learning outcomes of the German course, participants\u2019 enthusiastic feedback, as well as our Greek partner\u2019s over 10 years of experience related to animations, we decided to take the theme further afield. Hence, we have designed a practical KA1 youth workers mobility (Training Course) \u201cAnimate to Participate\u201d. The project's main aim is to develop capacities of youth organisations in the use of animations as the innovative, non-formal education, dissemination and empowerment tool. In order to achieve that, the following objectives shall be implemented step by step:\r\n\r\n- analysing the importance of animation in information sharing and assessing its application in the youth field\r\n- bringing together youth work practitioners and training them in the basics of animation techniques \r\n- discovering the potential of the available ICT and media tools in launching, testing and implementation of animation in the youth field \r\n- increasing partner promoters capacity to provide creative and innovative solutions to ensure greater visibility and dissemination of our everyday work  \r\n- through the use of animations > fostering active participation and development of key competences for the benefit of members and service users of our organisations\r\n - exchanging best practices as well as providing space for networking and development of future project ideas based on the creative forms of expression (e.g. animations).\r\n \r\n\r\n- WORKING METHODS: \r\n\r\nTraining course will see the application of traditional non-formal educational methods, including: name games, energisers and teambuilding exercises; presentations (both online and offline); one-to-one and group work;  discussions e.g. round table, brainstorming, etc.; networking and exchange of best practices; reflection time; learning by doing, etc.\r\n\r\n- IMPACT:\r\n\r\n* Participant level\r\n- increased knowledge, skills and attitudes related to the use of animations and digital tools in the local/national and international youth work activities\r\n- concrete (hard) skills developed in the use of animations (stop motion technique)\r\n- greater awareness gained of how to use animations as part of DEOR activities or in educational context (e.g. when creating animated content) \r\n- improved motivation to be an active yet considerate user of ICT tools\r\n- improved confidence and belief in one\u2019s own creative and innovative potential.\r\nAll these will be complemented by:\r\n- new international friendships developed\r\n- increased motivation to use newly gained competences back at home when working with the sending organisations as well as youth and community groups\r\n- eagerness to engage in further ERAMSU+ partnerships aimed at giving upskilling and giving voice (e.g. through creative forms of expression) to those who need it. \r\n\r\n* Organisational level \r\n- staff members, volunteers, trainers, etc. trained in the field of animations   \r\n- creative and innovative ideas developed for the sake of promoting organisations, creating more engaging educational tools, providing bridge for the community work (all these can be granted through the application of animations)\r\n- new international contacts developed (not all partner promoters have yet worked together!)\r\n- new ideas for local and international projects developed.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-035636_coordinator"], [2016, "Facilitarium 2 - art of visual facilitation of learning", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 24817.0, 13, 17, "-TYPE OF ACTIVITY: youth workers mobility - training course- DATES:  20-10 July 2016 - VENUE: Worcester, United Kingdom- NO. OF PARTICIPANTS and STAFF: 35- COUNTRIES ENGAGED: United Kingdom, Estonia, Austria, Poland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Lithuania, Romania,Spain, Bulgaria, Greece and Hungary.CONTEXT: The proposed project idea is based upon the concept of the similar training course on visual facilitation carried out in Estonia back in 2014. Previous project (Facilitarium - http://facilitarium2014.tumblr.com/about) turned out to be highly successful - it not only showed how important facilitation skills are in general, but also how innovative approaches (e.g. the use of visualisation techniques) can help strengthen the overall learning of the target groups as well as enhance the impact and value of educational activities in general. Experience shows that using visualisaltion techniques is becoming more and more popular in the youth sector training, information and exchange activities thanks to their innovation, simplicity and just very big slice of difference in comparison with regular digital ways. In addition to that, recent studies and researches prove that learning is becoming more individual, therefore it should meet the needs and learning styles of different participants/learners, at the same time offering them space for skills acquisition. Visual communication and facilitation certainly provide that through constant active involvement of the learners.  AIM and OBJECTIVES:With the following project we wish to propose a highly practical, hands-on training course aimed at improving the quality of communication and educational activities of youth NGOs. This will be done by means of providing their staff (e.g. trainers, facilitators, teachers, coaches, youth work practitioners, volunteers and all those engaged in conducting educational activities) with a set of tools and practices for enhanced visual facilitation. These can later be used when organising all sorts of educational and informational activities in the youth field e.g. training courses, seminars, partners meetings, study visits, exchanges, presentations, meetings etc.In order to reach the project aim, the following objectives have been set:\u2014 to explore and better understand the need for visual facilitation of learning in the youth activities nowadays (note: it is important that each of the organisations and participants engaged in the course discover the context in which VF can be used in their own everyday work)\u2014 to equip participants with the variety of tools and methods applicable in visual facilitation and mapping of educational and informational activities in the youth field\u2014 to develop practical skills in using important components of visual facilitation (e.g. shapes, colours, composition, hand-writing, visual metaphors, analysing and summing up of information\u2014 to set up the basis for further development of these skills on individual and organisational level in order to ensure the exploitation of newly gained knowledge for the benefit of NGOs and a variety of learners we work with.METHODOLOGY:The working methods of the training will include typical non-formal education methods, focused on individual and group exercises, workshops, live presentations, discussions, quests for experience and tests for skills, by which we are going to cover all the components of visual facilitation process. Most importantly, though, training course is a hands-on activity which means that project's agenda includes a lot of creative practical tasks allowing participants to reveal their talents and master facilitation skills. IMPACT:The proposed project offers a great learning and capacity building potential for participants involved, partner promoters as well as target groups we all tend to work with back home. These are typically young people, as well as occasionally children and adult learners. Here, those attending will be provided with the unique opportunity to develop a set of highly creative and by far innovative competences in visual facilitation of learning. As such, the skills and knowledge gained can be used broadly across various fields, encouraging creativity within meeting rooms, board rooms, workshops, training courses, classrooms and any other places, where visual facilitation of learning is deemed useful. This means that the effects of our joint work are likely to not only target direct partner involved but may stretch out to our local communities as well as any other work carried out by the partners at the regional, national and international level. We expect that also the proposed project will have significant impact on the participants and partner promoters, thus leading to new ideas and future projects being planned. Here, the process of taking next steps after the project shall be skilfully facilitated and will be incorporated in the training course daily timetable.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA105-023288_coordinator"], [2016, "Inter-Mediate \u2013 training course on intercultural social mediation", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 24784.0, 12, 12, "Social change has always been a process provoking tensions and clashes of interest.

During 7 days of training they will have an opportunity to learn how to use mediation and negotiation \u2013 methods efficiently used in international business relations \u2013 in order to support communication process and resolve disputes arising between conflicted groups. It is already proven on an international and national business level that mediation is the most efficient tool for bringing hostile parties together and supporting them in finding common grounds and interests. Participants will learn how to identify various types of conflicts (conflict of values, generations, structures, relations, access to information etc.) arising on multicultural background and will explore different methods of resolving them. The training will be focused on practice and simulations in order to provide the best learning environment and to enable participants to experience different conflicts that can arise in their daily work. Youth workers will be challenged to both act as mediators and to experience the attitudes and emotions of conflicted sides. Simulations will be based on real-life conflicts that are currently present in Europe in order to find solutions and recommendations that can be later implemented in other countries and environments.As a result of \u2018Inter-Mediate\u2019 training course participants will have basic skills and competences necessary to serve as social mediators in their communities and through patience and joint effort to support and facilitate social change in intercultural environment.

Additionally, an important objective of this project is to give the chance to local urban artists to convey the social messages of their urban artworks to the public and bring in their ideas as well as share their beliefs and concerns. Young people with fewer opportunities will be given the opportunity to express themselves by learning to do street art and at the same time respecting the private and public property. Presentations and discussions concerning vandalism to the local society of Thessaloniki will be held as graffiti vandalism has affected a considerrable number of monuments  in Thessaloniki which subsequently harms the city\u2019s image and the monuments themselves.\r\n\r\nThrough non-formal learning methods, the participants will exchange best practices and their ideas regarding the use of urban art as a tool for social inclusion and social dialogue. They will gain knowledge about the different aspects of urban development and active participation in the society and will acquire methods and tools to incorporate street art in youth work by working with people from different disciplines. The participants will discover innovative and alternative methods and ideas to utilise and implement in their work with the youth at local, national and international level, as well as improve their personal acquisition of competences.\r\n\r\nThe working methods of the project are the following: presentations, round-table discussions, team-building games, energizers and warm-ups, workshops, creative group-orientated work, discussions and intercultural activities with the local people, intercultural evenings, evaluation and reflection meetings, study visits and a presentation of urban artworks and street performances which will be prepared during the project. Multifaceted workshops will be creative realisations of the participants ideas, and will involve actively the participants, the locals, the local young people and young people with fewer opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe desired impact of the training course is an enhanced awareness concerning the potential of engagement in the society through urban art and the opportunities of changing the urban landscape of European cities and of spreading messages that promote social inclusion, social dialogue, understanding, cultural diversity and solidarity. The transnational aspect of the project will furthermore improve the networking across boarders, and thereby will have an international impact, securing the exchange of multifaceted experience and ideas. On all levels, this project is desired to have a long term impact of improved social integration, active engagement and a positive attitude towards creativity and art in urban spaces.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-2-DE04-KA105-012868_1"], [2016, "Building Resilience For Youth Employability Programme", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 23691.0, 11, 13, "The proposed project is a KA1 youth workers mobility which will take place in Worcester, United Kingdom on 3-10 December 2016 and will gather 33 participants from 11 countries: Latvia, Estonia, Greece, Poland,  Macedonia, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia,  Spain, Turkey and the UK. AIM and OBJECTIVES:The main aim of the training course is to develop the capacities of youth work practitioners (youth workers, community development officers, facilitators, trainers, group leaders, mentors, etc.) in using coaching as an effective guidance, motivation and empowerment tool in building young people\u2019s resilience for the job market. This will be achieved by:-Assessing and reviewing the key youth employability issues around Europe today so as to better understand the need for a different approach of guidance and support being provided to young people accessing the jobs market.-Equipping youth work practitioners with a set of psychological coaching tools that will directly be applied within career coaching, the empowerment of young people and in the building of their resilience.  -Supporting Youth Workers to directly assess well-being of young people in order to appropriately apply the tools to the their personal and professional development.-Exchanging additional tools and best practices that the course participants will share with each other within the programme. -Supporting participants to take the learning forward beyond the programme through acting as multipliers of learning, cascading the knowledge they have gained to their organisation in their home countries and throughout other professionals in the field. -Facilitating networking opportunities between partner promoters and the development of strategies for the future joint projects aimed at youth guidance and support (especially those to be implemented within ERASMUS+). METHODS USED:So as to help achieve project objectives we shall employ a supportive coaching methodological approach. This implies workshops delivery based on the principles of non-formal education (e.g. experiential learning, theoretical and practical knowledge shared, cooperative learning, shared responsibility, personal reflection etc.). The approach will be further enriched with numerous practical examples of tools, methods, approaches as well as case studies that have brought about change and success in the subject area. As such, the approaches are highly participatory, cooperative and rather self reflective. Several learning opportunities have been predicted and designed and surely incalculable others will occur through interaction, co\u2013existence and cooperation.SAMPLE IMPACT:- Practical competences developed within the subject matters covered during the course - this relates to the knowledge of diverse working tools, skills in using these in variety of contexts, positive attitude towards using the new tools to support young people in the job market;- More resilience of the Youth Workers as they apply tools learnt to themselves and their own work contexts (directly resulting in enhanced focus and attention, better decision making, more self-awareness, greater creativity, better resilience and emotional intelligence amongst other changes);- Developed better understanding and more holistic perspective on youth unemployment and ways to tackle it;- Greater confidence and better quality of interventions applied in a wide range of contexts related to getting young people into employment;(Benefit  for partner organisations)- Having their representatives trained in coaching and building resilience - new competences developed are likely not only to be used in supporting young people, but will surely influence the way teams work back home;- Strengthened cooperation at the international level and new contacts developed (not all partners have already had the chance to work together);- New ideas for future cooperation developed, either within the topics discussed during the course or any other joint areas of interest identified;- Access to wide range of educational tools that are to improve the quality and level of support given to young people (particularly the ones seeking employment, etc.). (Impact on the young people) -  Getting more young people into employment or training (particularly those disadvantaged ones, insecure, without concrete or any educational background, etc.);- Changing young people\u2019s perspectives regarding the job search. Here: greater resilience applied, healthier perspectives developed, positive attitudes, openness to challenges and treating these as opportunities, etc.We hope to see the impact growing bigger and bigger with time and positively influencing all parties involved.

These activities are divided between outdoor and indoor, both carried out through non-formal and informal education methods. The coordinator background is of an experienced cultural organization involving young. The other partners have the right competences in training and educative activities for young, facing now the specific need to also promote social inclusion. The project is trying to respond to young participants (YP) needs and participating organizations ones.The project aims to: 1)create sharing moments to let YP learn by other's experiences;2)improve participants self-esteem allowing young to measure their integration and interaction skills;3)encourage YP to develop critical thinking about media literacy and communication power;4)increase the sense of belonging to Europe;5)create lasting connections between young Europeans;6)facilitate the multilevel effects of this experience even through the YP participation to follow-up activities. Participants are young of age between 18 and 30 from different backgrounds: disadvantaged, youngsters without an healthy and sustainable life styles, passive citizens doesn't contributing to the society, some are still in education, some are employed or self-employed. Specific attention is addressed to young with fewer opportunities like NEET category (not in education, employment or training), young with linguistic and cultural difficulties, young immigrants, young that have not travelled abroad yet or young experiencing economic hardships.The YP are going to be 48: each partner will select 12 of them (6 female and 6 male); among them  8 will be group leaders and 16 young with fewer opportunities.  The activities are going to be:-cooking party: traditional national food show;-workshop: YP will be lead to reflect among the potential to belong to Europe; the possible social change in a democratic and ethical perspective;-play game: activity developed with play cards prepared by the YP with the purpose to make them aware of the communication as better way to overcome cultural obstacles; -visit to local association addressed to immigrants with the aim to allow YP to understand immigrant needs;-peer discussion about the role of education in the construction of an intercultural and integrated Europe; the change of the cultural values among generations; the use of ICT tools to spread culture also to old generation; the culture and creativity innovation role;- pictures during side walking: taking pictures, collecting them and then discuss their meaning. A final competition will vote for the best picture associated with the deepest meaning.   To generate an important impact, we need to go beyond classical training courses. The participants are eagerly encouraged to build their own learning process and this is the best condition to understand the non-formal education power (NFE).The connecting line upon which runs the NFE is based on:experiencing different educational settings and non formal education methods;reflecting on methods and their impact, on NFE power and limits and on the construction of pedagogical process;transferring in the one\u2019s own reality what is been learned; sharing different perceptions, present and experiences;developing the creativity of YP involving them in the project learning process decision.The activities have been chosen to make YP work in cooperation, showing and defending their opinions while listening and respecting other\u2019s. Moreover, the activities are going to enhance participants transversal competences:  the capacity to work in team, the ability to constructively interact and to respect the tasks assigned to them. Alongside with these competences, YP will improve organizational, linguistic, and communication skills. The project will have positive effects also on target groups and participant organizations.  The impact will be not only at local level through a direct interaction of the young with the local population, but also wider, laying the foundations for a solid and constructive cooperation between different organizations addressed to youth.The project is going to generate multiplier effects starting from the participants experience told to other young and then fostering them towards other  Erasmus+ mobility experiences.

During the last decades of the severe economic crises, rural villages have been suffering a dramatic depopulation, thus also encountering difficulties such as, for instance, territorial imbalances and lack of generational relief. As a result, unemployment in rural areas has mainly affected services and agriculture. \r\n\r\nA prosperous agricultural sector can only be developed with the involvement of young people: our aging agricultural community needs \u2018new blood\u2019 to make the sector more dynamic and open to the on-going technological transformations. However, young people, young farmers and other new entrants face considerable obstacles activity -among them societal ones- in starting up farming, while the situation is hampered by the prevailing perception that farming constitutes an unattractive or old-fashioned occupation, sometimes with inappropriate social protection.\r\n\r\nOne of the objectives of EU till 2020 is the reinforcement of agriculture and simultaneously the enhancement of young farmers, by providing them the essential know-how that will enable them to get into the entrepreneurship sector. Based on such rationale, \u2018Agro-entrepreneurship Accelerator\u2019 comes to complete this boost by providing youth workers with all the information needed in order to support young people to enter the world of agro-entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea of the project is the implementation of an Agro-entrepreneurship training, which will constitute the distillate of the participating organizations\u2019 contribution. Inasmuch all the partners have been recognized for the vital role of agriculture education in relation to young people, they have decided to establish an innovative, specialized international training. This training will enable youth workers to gain theoretical and practical knowledge in the field of agriculture. Hence, the fundamental aim of the training is the provision of a contemporary pedagogical material appealing to youth workers, which will consequently operate as the main catalyst in inspiring young people to apply agro-entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n\u2018Agro-entrepreneurship accelerator\u2019 will not only enrich youth workers knowledge concerning the field but it is also seeking to contribute to the reduction of youth unemployment by boosting rural and regional economy through the creation of new agribusinesses, or the involvement of a greater percentage of young people in the agricultural sector. More specifically, the amplification of education in combination with the creation of an unprecedented strong networking amongst youth workers with strong interest in the sector of agriculture, will definitely help to refresh the economic activities in rural areas, thus aiming to regional development, a fact that provides an additional quality and an added value to the project. \r\n\r\nTo conclude with, \u2018Agro-entrepreneurship accelerator\u2019 project aims at the education of the next generation of entrepreneurs who are concerned with the agricultural ramifications of entrepreneurship. This target will be successfully accomplished through the production of capable influential multipliers, such as civil society organizations and youth workers who will eventually be fully-educated to educate, and therefore to exploit the material derived from the project. More analytically, by the integration of a range of well-designed non-formal methods, ICT tools and educational material in the normal activities of the above-mentioned organizations, the potential agro-entrepreneurs will be trained by youth workers to maximize both their entrepreneurial skills and the agricultural know-how, thus identifying those challenges of our times which might enable them to develop solutions and models for sustainable agro-businesses.\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives of the training as they result from the specially-developed workshop:\r\n\r\n- The provision of NFE tools to youth workers/leaders  in order to spread awareness about agricultural entrepreneurship; \r\n- The development of specific competences in planning/executing NFE activities targeted at young people, with a focus on youth in rural areas; \r\n- The development of entrepreneurial skills aimed at supporting the growth of a new generation of agricultural entrepreneurs; \r\n- The reinforcement of youth involvement in agriculture; \r\n- To generate a new network, capable to develop knowledge based strategic partnerships concerning agro-entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe international training course \u2018Agro-entrepreneurship Accelerator\u2019 will be hosted in Larnaca by \u2018CIP\u2019 from 20 to 26/11/2018 in cooperation with partner organizations from the following 16 countries: Germany, Greece, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Romania, Bulgaria, UK and Spain.

Discrimination, violence and racism are everywhere prevalent \u2013 bullying in schools, hate speech and hate crime against migrants, refugees, minorities, vulnerable groups and LGBTs, racist insults against people who seem to be \"different\" as well as sexual harassment. Civil courage essentially describes two things: a persons courage to speak out in the public sphere, and readiness to stand up and help their fellow citizens in time of need. One's ability to judge and act upon civil courage comes when one clearly senses injustice. The training course \"Everyday Heroes\" aims to empower 33 youth workers, youth leaders and educators from Albania, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and United Kingdom to develop ways to combat hate speech, and strengthen support for human rights through non-formal education and awareness-raising actions from 12 to 18 November 2018 in Dresden, Germany.

The participants will learn how to take action and defend principles of justice, fairness and morality as well as to speak up in situations marked by injustice and racist discrimination. The participants will learn how to stand up for their opinions and rights and understand that silence is not a solution.\r\nThe training course includes the following pedagogical guidelines:\r\n- Enabling self-determined and holistic learning processes through non-formal learning methods and theatre techniques such as Forum Theatre and the Theatre of the Oppressed\r\n- Discussions, team-building activities, group work, simulation games, role playing and plenary sessions based on the interests and personal experiences of the participants\r\n- Opening-up experimental fields instead of judging the behavior and the actions of the participants\r\n- Using performative and visual arts as well as digital media as tools to encourage dialogue and cultural interaction as well as to work on the design of campaigns against Hate Speech\r\nThe methodology of the training course is based on theoretical inputs, action-promoting simulation games and interactive exercises. The learning content offers numerous opportunities to reflect on one's own actions and to exchange ideas with the other group members. The training course offers on the one hand basics about moral courage, different factors and forms of violence and hate and the causes of missing help behavior. On the other hand, learning situations are provided, in which reality is simulated, and a comprehension of feelings and experiences through the simulation games can be realised. Each of the participants will be actively involved and will be encouraged to recreate occasions for civil courage and options for action. To be able to tailor the training course to the needs of the group, the expectations and fears are queried at the beginning and integrated into the content. The training course will be concluded by an evaluation, but also during each training day, phases of reflection and discussion are planned. \r\nIt is aspired that the participants will learn how to stand-up and take action in situations where hate, violence, discrimination and racism are observed and that after this training course the youth workers and youth leaders and educators will transfer their knowledge and skills to the young people of their local communities so that a multiplier effect is achieved. An online guidebook about civil courage will be published and will be available on the website of Jugend- & Kulturprojekt e.V. and its facebook page which will include a variety of methods and techniques in order to promote civil courage in non-formal education.

The manual will be prepared jointly by the course participants as well as partner promotes engaged in the project.METHODS:The very course will focus on the development of media related and digital competences that can easily be applied by the youth organisations in promoting their activities, reaching target groups, attracting funding, etc. So as to maximise the learning and impact exerted on the course participants, the main body of knowledge shall be delivered with the extensive use of non-formal education tools. These will include: individual / pair / groups work, discussions, brainstorming, teambuilding exercises, model thinking, simulation exercises, mind mapping, input by trainers, debriefing of exercises, individual and group reflection, etc. All these will be further enriched with energisers and other shorts activities used for capturing the attention. Also, the course is expected to be practical in nature. Therefore, workshops on the use of ICT and media tools will take place as part of the daily activities. For the sake of that participants will be encouraged to bring their own laptops, tables, camera, video recorders and any other digital resources to be used. Finally, study visit to the local library has been planned. The Hive is highly renowned in the area for being digitally advanced and open to new media solutions both for the staff and the public. EXPECTED IMPACT: - increased knowledge, skills and attitudes related to the use of new media and digital tools in the local/national and international youth work activities- concrete (hard) skills in the use of media tools developed - greater awareness gained of how to implement a media rich dissemination campaign- better understanding of the benefits and dangers of (mis)using media - greater confidence gained in using media and digital tool for the sake of organisation management and personal development- improved motivation to be an active yet considerate user of media tools, etc.- international network of new media in youth work supporters created - new ideas for local and international projects developed- staff members, volunteers, trainers, etc. trained in the use of new media tools and available to apply these into the organisation, etc.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA105-023278_coordinator"], [2018, "POWER in (e)MOTION", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 20948.0, 10, 10, "The project \"POWER in (e)MOTION\" is a training course that will be realised in Gulbene, Latvia  from the 27th August to 1st September2018 (travel days excluded), with the participation of 30 participants plus 2 trainers and 1 staff member from 10 countries (Latvia, UK, Greece, Poland, Romania, Italy, Portugal, Czech Republic, Germany, Spain).\r\nThe aim of the projects is to develop capacities of youth work practitioners (including youth workers, leaders of informal groups, trainers, coaches, etc.) in applying emotional intelligence practices to empower young people for their further personal and professional development.  \r\nThe course is targeting those working actively with young people such as:\r\n- Youth Workers (volunteers and/or employed staff)\r\n- trainers and facilitators at the local and/or international level\r\n- coaches and mentors engaged with youth initiative groups, volunteers, etc.\r\n- volunteers and other members of partner organisations who are interested in developing their personal and professional capacities in the field\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are:\r\nA.

Unemployment  is one of the causes of social exclusion. For many young people unemployment implies lack of opportunities, lack of future perspectives, limited personal development, low self-esteem, the impossibility of becoming autonomous. Unemployment affects young people from a variety of backgrounds, at different times of their lives and in various circumstances. Unemployment is a social problem that everybody may face. But when it affects young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, their situation is harder due to the lack of support. Those young people become unemployed more easily and unemployment can be the starting point of a \u201cnegative snowball effect\u201d. Then, they face problems of different kinds which come together in a short period of time and/or accumulate in other ways. Our tasks as youth workers, youth leaders are to find these young people with disadvantaged background and provide them such type of youth work tools based on the youth policies of European Commission which can provide them possibilities to overcome their multi problem situations and empower them to become self \u2013 confident and employed or even self \u2013 employed European citizens. The overall aim of the seminar is to provide space for youth workers, youth leaders to understand better the background and causes of long term unemployment of young people and get familiar with youth policies made by European Commission in order to fight against that and how these youth policies can be adapted into local youth work activities by exploring and inventing new tools on positive thinking, empowering job seekers and fighting against social exclusion in local and transnational level. \u201dBecause of You(th)!\u201d  who will be the employers, staff and volunteers of the partner organisations who actively work with unemployed young people. Their target groups have multi problem situations e.g. unemployed young people from rural areas or with immigrants background or from a Roma family or having some disabilities, etc. The seminar will be based on the principles of non \u2013 formal education and aimed at using formal, informal and non \u2013 formal learning elements. Trainers will focus on to invent huge variety of methods in order to provide learning opportunities for all people having different learning styles. The methodology will be learner centre and based on the interest, needs and expectations of partner organisations and their participants. During the seminar, there will be several methods used when participants can experience being the situation of an unemployed young people in order to foster their emotional and rational understanding concerning this multi problem situation. Other role plays will provide them opportunity to try them out being in different roles of a youth worker who work with unemployed young people. Participant can try out different tools and methods in a safe environment. Some examples for methods we will use during the seminar:  individual work, pair work, small mixed group work, national group work, role plays, theatre method, making a collage, symbolize, making definitions, express a link between theory and practice, drawings, etc.  Methodological flow of the seminar: Who we are and what we will do here together? What are the background and causes of youth unemployment in general and in different countries? What are the characteristic of the multi problem situation regarding to being unemployed? What are the youth policy approaches and proposals towards youth unemployment by European Commission and how can we achieve these in our local youth work? What can be the tools locally and transnational level to break the unemployed situation? How can positive thinking be used? How can we empower the young job seekers? How can we fight against social exclusion? How transnational youth projects supported by Erasmus + programme can support young people to become employee or self \u2013 employer? Results and impact: To prepare, run and evaluate several youth activities local and transnational level by using the gained tools from the seminar which can support young job seekers to get to know themselves better, being able to identify their needs and support them finding appropriate youth work possibility locally or European level where they can improve their needed competences what can lead them towards finding or establishing a job for themselves.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-TR01-KA105-013889_6"], [2016, "The Quality Mark in Youth Work", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 20281.0, 9, 9, "\"The Quality Mark in Youth Work\" is a mobility project that will take place in Trikala, Greece, from 6th to 13th December 2016 and It will bring together 31 participants from EU countries  and  one non EU, in particular from: Malta, Slovenia, Spain,  Netherlands, United Kingdom, Greece, Romania, Poland and Turkey.

It will bring together 35 participants from 16 countries across Europe to explore the ways in which the natural environment can be used as an effective tool for youth workers to engage with their young people. Outdoor activities such as bushcraft, survival skills and sustainable environmental management skills have been crucial to mankind in the past and are being re-discovered by a new generation as awareness grows about the impact of human activities on the finite resources of our planet. \r\n\r\nOutdoor activities in this field are a great informal learning tool, helping to develop a whole range of practical social and cognitive skills as they involve working together as well as individually on a variety of tasks. \r\n\r\nThe very idea to implement the course was born out of the previous TC \u2018Youth in Nature\u2019 which Consilium DT implemented in the Wyre Forest in 2013.

Taking into consideration that the progress against these challenges will be intolerably slow if only 3% to 5% of EU\u2019s population consider they can solve them, we are of the opinion that this fact creates an urgent need to teach people about social entrepreneurship in order to help them to make lasting and important changes in their communities and across the EU.As one could realize during his engagement with European programs, only recently, it has been given a great emphasis by EU, on the education and training concerning social entrepreneurship. This fact could specifically be observed through Erasmus+ program and it could possibly be reflected by the idea that Europe needs more capable and eager social entrepreneurs.  For those reasons, the EU has continuously been searching for the appropriate ways to inspire the potential entrepreneurs, in order to encourage them to set up their new social enterprises.At the present time, the education of people on the applicability of entrepreneurial fields is highly necessary especially for the creation of new venture with a social orientation. The development of new small businesses which, most of the times, are accompanied by a social spirit, does not only empower the economic situation through the creation of new jobs, but it also provides solutions that enhance positive social change.Social entrepreneurship represents an innovative and effective mechanism for addressing many problems around the world, despite this fact it has only recently started to gain momentum. By increasing the scope of social entrepreneurship in a natural way, and primarily through the education of social entrepreneurship, we aim to familiarize youth workers with the new trend called \u2018social entrepreneurship\u2019, in order to be capable to assimilate the appropriate skills and tools which could potentially lead to the concrete education of the young people, on the fields associated with a construction of sustainable social enterprise.TSS project primarily aims at the education of the next generation of entrepreneurs, who are concerned with the sociological ramifications of entrepreneurship. This target will be successfully accomplished through the production of capable influential multipliers, such as civil society organizations and youth workers, who will eventually be fully-educated to educate, and therefore to exploit, the material derived from TSS project. More analytically, by the integration of a range of well-designed non-formal methods, ICT tools and educational material in the normal activities of the above-mentioned organizations, the potential social entrepreneurs will be trained to maximize their skills, thus identifying those challenges of our times which might enable them to develop solutions and models for sustainable social organizations.Whilst JuBuK members and partners have recognized the need and therefore the importance of social entrepreneurship in EU, they have altogether taken the initiative to develop a special training in Germany concerning ''The Social Start-up'' (TSS). Accordingly, the abbreviation \u2018TSS\u2019 refers to the ensemble of youth workers deriving from all the organizations which will be involved in the project and who will consequently accelerate the further development of social entrepreneurship culture across the EU. The scope of \u2018TSS\u2019 training is to provide youth workers with an insight on social entrepreneurship, which could possibly operate as the main catalyst in inspiring young people to apply social entrepreneurship.The main objectives of the project are set below:- To acquaint with the principles of \u2018social entrepreneurship\u2019.- To acquire the appropriate skills which would enable the youth workers in order to support young people to build social enterprises that address the challenges of our time.-To promote, within specific well-designed practices, the development of innovative ideas concerning sociological fields. -To share national resources and inform about European ones (social entrepreneurship education and learning, access to different types of funding, partnerships, networks etc.) useful for social enterprise creation and sustainability; -To share practical non-formal educational methods that motivate, and therefore engage young people with activities related to social entrepreneurship -To create strong partnerships, capable to develop future projects concerning social entrepreneurship and beyond.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-DE04-KA105-014185_10"], [2016, "Think, Share, Learn!", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 19574.0, 10, 10, "\u201cThink, Share, Learn!\u201d - Training course on competence development of young people with fewer opportunities by cooperative learning structures through youth work activities will be held in Recoaro Terme, Italy from the 5th till the 12th of November 2016. We will have 33 participants from Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, Poland and UK. As youth workers we have been working with young people with fewer opportunities with special focus on unemployed young people, migrants kids, rural youth, Roma young people, minority young people and we have to improve our youth workers\u2019 capacity to invent, prepare, use and adapt such type of creative and innovative methods, techniques and tools which can be useful in our youth work for the sake of our target groups. It is very hard nowadays to motivate young people with fewer opportunities to be part of any type of activities but it is even harder to keep them involved into it. So the main reason of our projects is to explore the techniques of cooperative learning, how it can be adapted into our local youth work realities. Cooperative learning techniques can improve transversal skills, emotional quotient, and social skills of young people with fewer opportunities through youth work activities. By youth work activities our aim is to develop the interpersonal competences of our target groups according to their needs, so having main focus on listening, respect different opinions, leadership, problem solving, conflict solving, help to each others, critical thinking, creative thinking, etc. Besides these transversal skills, it is essential to develop and improve their EQ with special focus on self-esteem, self-control, self\u2013motivation, empathy, partnership. Young people with fewer opportunities need to be supported to feel important, to make self \u2013 assessment, to get positive messages, to recognise their own values and experience to be important part of the community. During cooperative learning, they can experience and recognise how good to be a member of a diverse group, taking responsibility for each others, supporting each others, enjoying a group work, developing communication skills, to be committed, to be creative, to be motivated, etc. These skills are necessary nowadays to enter to the labour market and even to be happy and successful in our work and family lives. For that we need to find innovative and creative and useful methods which can provide appropriate support for young people in need. In order to achieve that, we, as youth workers have to develop ourselves, our youth workers\u2019 competences and learn to use and adapt useful techniques and structures for the success of our work, success of our target groups and for the success of the future of European Union. Our overall aim is to understand the meaning of cooperative learning, to explore its techniques and structures and adapt it into youth work realities based on the needs of young people with fewer opportunities. Being able to understand the different motivation factors of young people and how it can be used within youth work activities. Being able to prepare, run and evaluate youth work workshops by using techniques and structures of cooperative learning on developing social skills, communication skills, decision making skills, know \u2013 how, information skills, critical thinking, creative thinking and cooperation skills of young people with fewer opportunities.

Theatre of the Oppressed is a set of non-formal learning methods and exercises of Augusto Boal, which places the viewer in the spotlight of the theatrical act, turning him into the protagonist of the play and in this way helping him to become the protagonist in real life by learning how to act and change the world in which he lives in. The project will encourage the participants and then the young people with whom they work, especially those with fewer opportunities, independently of social, educational or cultural backgrounds, to communicate their thoughts, express their feelings, learn how not to accept injustice and oppression. They will learn how to express their thoughts on european issues, participate in the construction of Europe, identify common values with people from other countries despite their cultural differences, challenging views that perpetuate inequality and discrimination,promote respect for cultural heritage and the fight against racism and xenophobia.Coordinator of the project is ActArt, an informal group of young people which consists of many and  very experienced members both in Theatre of the Oppressed and in the coordination and organisation of european programs. The quantity and quality of the partners achieves the second objective of the plan which is the internationalization of the participants, the strengthening of the relationships between the partners and the exchange of experience on issues concerning young people.

OF PARTICIPANTS and STAFF: 30\r\n- COUNTRIES ENGAGED: Poland, United Kingdom, Estonia, Romania, Greece, Latvia, Slovakia, Croatia, Austria, Norway, Czech Republic and Turkey.\r\n\r\nCONTEXT: \r\n\r\nThe proposed project idea is based on the concept of the similar course on visual facilitation carried out in Estonia in 2014. Previous project (Facilitarium) turned out to be highly successful - it not only showed how important  facilitations skills are in general, but also how innovative approaches (e.g. the use of visualisation techniques) can help strengthen the overall learning of the target groups as well as enhance the impact and value of educational activities. \r\n\r\nThe main theme of the training is addressing visual tools as an approach to enhanced facilitation of educational and informational activities organised by NGOs and individuals active in the youth field. Visual does not refer here to graphic means only (although graphic component is usually the biggest), but it also encompasses any other tools which allow to communicate ideas and information visually through diverse means e.g. paper-cutting and folding, collages, different 3d shapes, digital presentations etc.\r\n\r\nAIM and OBJECTIVES:\r\n\r\nThe following KA1 project is based on implementation of a highly practical, hands-on training course aimed at improving the quality of communication and educational activities of youth NGOs by means of providing their staff (e.g. trainers, facilitators, teachers, coaches, youth work practitioners, volunteers and all those engaged in conducting educational activities) with a set of tools and practices for enhanced visual facilitation. These can later be used when organising all sorts of educational and informational activities in the youth field e.g. training courses, seminars, partners meetings, study visits, exchanges, presentations, meetings etc.\r\n\r\nIn order to reach the project aim, the following objectives have been set:\r\n\r\n\u2014 to explore and better understand the need for visual facilitation of learning in the youth activities nowadays (note: it is important that each of the organisations and participants engaged in the course discover the context in which VF can be used in their own everyday work);  \r\n\u2014 to bring together 30 practicing facilitators with lack of or low visual presentation skills and newcomers in the training and facilitation field so as to explore the benefits of visual facilitation;\r\n\u2014 to explore and learn the variety of tools and methods applicable for visual facilitation and mapping of educational and informational activities in the youth field;\r\n\u2014 to develop participants\u2019 skills in using important components of visual facilitation: shapes, colours, composition, hand-writing, paper-fold and -cut techniques, visual metaphors, analysing and summing up of information;\r\n\u2014 to set up the basis for further development of these skills on individual and organisational level in order ensure the exploitation of newly gained knowledge for the benefits of NGOs and a variety of learners we work with;\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY:\r\n\r\nThe working methods of the training will include typical non-formal education methods, focused on individual and group exercises, workshops, live presentations, discussions, quests for experience and tests for skills, by which we are going to cover all the components of visual facilitation process. Most importantly, though, training course is a hands-on activity which means that project's agenda includes a lot of creative practical tasks allowing participants to reveal their talents and master facilitation skills. \r\n\r\nIMPACT:\r\n\r\nThe proposed project offers a great learning and capacity building potential for participants involved, partner promoters as well as target groups we all tend to work with back home. These are typically young people, as well as occasionally children and adult learners. Here, those attending will be provided with the unique opportunity to develop a set of highly creative and by far innovative competences in visual facilitation of learning. As such, the skills and knowledge gained can be used broadly across various fields, encouraging creativity within meeting rooms, board rooms, workshops, training courses, classrooms and any other places, where visual facilitation of learning is deemed useful. This means that the effects of our joint work are likely to not only target direct partner involved but may stretch out to our local communities as well as any other work carried out by the partners at the regional, national and international level. \r\n\r\nWe expect that also the proposed project will have significant impact on the participants and partner promoters, thus leading to new ideas and future projects being planned.

XXI century is epoch of informational technologies and who rule them they have a power. That`s why it is really important and useful for youth people to know what is the main role of Media or PR for developing and informing the everyday life of society. In order to have and control information about our organization or company we should know how to use PR methods and Media recourses.\r\n\r\nNowadays PR of the organizations and of the concept of youth work, cooperation between NGOs and media and exploitation of tools of new media are very significant. They can be used to increase attractiveness of young volunteers on labour market by showing useful skills, which they gain during youth work. Unfortunately very often members of youth organizations are afraid of using new technologies or PR activities to talk with journalists or they do not know how to deal with them. They face with a problem how to reach potential volunteers for their projects, partner organizations to work with and sponsors and how to get \"good PR\" of their work. \r\n\r\nThey also think that PR is effective only for commercial structures and needs a huge financial support, which is major mistake. After analyzing of a deep need in the youth organizations of gaining knowledge and practice in PR we decided to design a Training Course in this field. \r\n\r\nThe training is aiming to provide an opportunity for those, who are involved youth work related to volunteering to improve their knowledge how to apply PR tools in the organizations and how to use media, especially so called new media \u201cpower of XXI century\u201d and the programme ERASMUS+ in general to develop the quality of their projects and to promote successfully young volunteers as potential employees.\r\n\r\nAnd TC objectives are:\r\n\r\n* To strengthen awareness and understanding among young leaders from different countries on significant role of Media and PR\r\n\r\n* To rise competences of youth people with different issues connected with Media and PR\r\n\r\n* To assist youth to take part in their organisation`s or \"Erasmus+\" projects popularization process\r\n\r\n* To improve and give a space to participants to obtaine competences in how to work with media successfully\r\n\r\n* To equip begginer participants in new and useful skills of PR promotion\r\n\r\nFrom each partner country we are expecting 5 participants (3 female and 2 male or 3 male and 2 female), totally 30 participants from 6 country. Participants should be over 18 years old. They should have strong motivation to improve topic related skills.\r\n\r\nTraining Course will provide as theoretical knowledge also practical skills for participants. During the TC participants will learn and get known to the modern techniques of PR, how to plan successful PR campaign, what methods and rules should be used, how to reach the aim and plan the projects in a better way: management of the effective budget, using resources, defining working plan and timetable. \r\n\r\nDuring the project we plan some visits at the places connected with PR and Media. Firstly participants will visit to the popular Georgian TV-channels, where they will meet Georgian journalists and study specifics of Georgian TV and modern technologies. They will have chance to have a look around, in news rooms, studios, where live, toc-shows, political or cultural programs are recorded. \r\n\r\nParticipants will visit to the one Ministry of Georgia, where they will meet department of relations with public and Media. They will have discussion and session with PR specialists, director of department and other workers. Participants will observe working process, their plan and strategy, how they arrange press-conferences and how they communicate with Media.\r\n\r\nThe Training Course will be based on the principles of non-formal learning and the main educationethods used will be: getting started with energizers, brainstorming sessions, active discussion and experience sharing, work in small groups and interactive presentations of the work results, showing the videos, visiting the places, role-plays and simulations, using open space technique for project development, etc. \r\n\r\nIn the TC participants will gain communication skills, understand needs of journalists and will learn how to deal with\r\n\r\nmedia effectively and promote youth work and useful skills on labour market, which their participants gain thanks to involvement in youth projects.
