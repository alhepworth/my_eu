Of great benefit also is the experience gained in the context of CEDRE.S first presented for Leonardo 2013. This allowed us to develop programmes specifically for a post-student public, coming out higher education, not a priority group in our previous programmes. It has also inspired the title given to this 2014 project, which seems to fit our target group.Whilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year. It would offer them an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d programme of qualification, embracing different job skills, technical linguistic capacities and intercultural exposure, all designed to meet the individual\u2019s specific needs at the time.One of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: the first lasting 6 weeks, particularly geared to young people in integration from level V to II, the second of 12 weeks targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.We have built a partnership network with 8 experienced intermediary organizations in different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee. Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.To encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we collaborate with centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 250 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment.

Located in the heart of the \u201cPays de Caux\u201d in the city of Bolbec (Normandy), the school is essentially composed of female students coming from underprivileged families. Therefore, their mobility is often low or even non-existent (this is made clear when they have to find a training or when they consider continuing with studies). Fully aware of that fact, we conducted our first Leonardo mobility experience in May 2013. It involved 8 girls who stayed and did their training period in Eastbourne, England for 4 weeks. This enthusiastic experience comforted us in the legitimacy of such a project. Our partnership with Breakaway Agency which was in charge of finding companies and families for our pupils was such a success that we decided to renew it.\r\nOur new mobility experience will involve 30 pupils taking their BTEC National exam in business ; 14 in their final year (out of 3 years) and 16 in their second year. This will be a 2-step-mobility-process : the latter will leave from Jan 25th to Feb 21st 2015 whereas the former will be in Eastbourne from March 8th to April 4th 2015. In the past, most of these students have had a particularly hectic and difficult time at school, thus being part of a \u201cEuropean section\u201d often helps them to restore their confidence in the school system and has enabled them to attend \u201cbusiness in English\u201d lessons since their first year in Pierre et Marie Curie.\r\nAs regards our students, this experience is to impact several areas :\r\n- the professional field (acquisition of professional reflexes in connection with the business world, adaptation to the workplace and an unfamiliar environment, work on professional attitudes such as punctuality\u2026),\r\n- the linguistic field (improvement and development of in-depth knowledge of professional and \u201ceveryday life\u201d English\u2026),\r\n- the personal field (gain of maturity and autonomy),\r\n- the cultural field (discovery of the Eastbourne area, trip to London\u2026).\r\nThe team is composed of 5 teachers (3 English teachers and 2 sales teachers who are qualified to teach their subject in English), the headmaster Mr HEBERT, Mrs LESUEUR, the person in charge of training periods and Mrs FALCIONI the superintendent manager. After a number of meetings required to set up the new terms, the team embarked on writing the Erasmus + project. Regarding the assistance on the mobility trips, it was decided that two teachers would go with the students the first and the last week of each trip (the latter being dedicated to assessments). Teachers will also be there during the weekends to prepare and supervise the various cultural outings. Mrs CHEVALLIER, the head of Breakaway Agency, is our provider. She is in charge of finding training places in Eastbourne, such as supermarkets (Sainsbury\u2019s for example) or charity shops (such as British Heart Foundation). As she is on the spot, she is available 24/7. \r\nAs regards mobility, three periods are to be distinguished : \r\n- beforehand: In addition to team meetings, we plan to keep parents and students informed of the project\u2019s progress through regular meetings at school. The previous experience has shown us that we absolutely had to remind them of the importance of administrative documents. We will involve students in coaching courses : 2 hours a week will be dedicated to the outings program and to situational dramatization (at the station for example..)\r\n- on site, teachers will ensure the installation of students in collaboration with Mrs CHEVALLIER who will also make sure the whole training period goes well. All of them will help the participants with the necessary things of daily life (bus ride, various purchases\u2026) and plan the weekend outings.\r\n- downstream, a \u201cfestive\u201d meeting will be held for all the mobility actors, the students will present the key moments of their stay in English, slideshows will be projected, skits played... On this occasion, we will ask the newspapers and television journalists to come along and spread the results of our experience as broadly as possible. A survey shall then be conducted among students to get to know how they feel about this experience... We will help them to get their European passport (EUROPASS) as well.\r\nAs the English language is often being undervalued in vocational schools, we first and foremost aim at creating a dynamic within the institution. Ideally through various communication paths, the European section of the school and our mobility project will increase our attractiveness with respect to other schools in the area and the academy of Rouen. We will also make sure our students get ready for their special oral exam (sales subject in English) in order to enhance their training period carried out abroad.", "http://www.breakaway.fr", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-001388_1"], [2014, "L'Europe dans l'assiette", "Breakaway", 24733.0, 6, 6, "The people concerned are the pupils that are undertaking their hospitality industry training in our establishment, the \u201cLyc\u00e9e des M\u00e9tiers de l\u2019H\u00f4tellerie et des Services \u2013 Jules Le Cesne\u201d (The Jules Le Cesne Vocational School for Hospitality and Services). The social dimension of our project becomes particularly pertinent when you take into account the fact that 70% of the young people who attend our establishment are considered to be \u201csocially disadvantaged\u201d. Allowing them to go abroad for free is a bet on the future of their employability, as hospitality is a sector where mobility is important and where the ability to speak modern languages is paramount, however their social situation does not often offer them the opportunity to be mobile. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe link between this Leonardo Da Vinci mobility project and the Jules Le Cesne vocational school\u2019s own project is no less relevant today as, within the context of the contract agreement, tackling early school leaving is the main objective of part of the measures taken and the actions carried out within the establishment.\r\n\r\nThere are many specific needs targeted:\r\n\r\n1. Optimising the chances of success in the exam by acquiring different work techniques in the professional environment as well as promoting the learning and the use of foreign languages in professional situations.\r\n\r\n2. Validating professional techniques by the assessment made through the joint work of the supervisor and the evaluator who fill in/expand on the work experience booklet when evaluating it at the end of the placement. \r\n\r\n3.

In this way, for several years we have been receiving Slovakian, Italian and Portuguese pupils who we accompany throughout their work placement. \r\n\r\nWorking in close collaboration with colleagues in our establishment who successfully coordinate Comenius has allowed us to develop partnerships with the hotel establishments hosting these ongoing programmes. We are therefore now in a position to offer our pupils the chance to go to Belgium, Portugal, England, Romania, Italy and Spain. All of this collaboration equally allows us to offer our pupils hotel establishments which are more appropriate for the skills expected in their assessment booklets for their work-based training period. Thus we now offer work placements for pupils with the \u201cbaccalaur\u00e9at professionnel\u201d, but also to those with the \u201cbaccalaur\u00e9at technologique\u201d. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis mobility programme is vital to us in order to pursue our politics of opening up to Europe.

Those students undergo their ultimate training period at the end of the upper sixth form, after five other internships in shops in France (they\u2019ve already done eighteen weeks in shops). Our students are hardly ever eighteen at the end of their studies. They\u2019ve got a peculiar profile, most of them had difficulties at school, some even changed their guidance on courses several times or others dropped out their studies for a while. The former mobility programs (except for the last one) have pointed the following weak points: incapacity to take part to the activities, difficulty to communicate with the staff and the customers and to live with the host family. The decision to make them do their training period during the upper sixth form which permits the students to acquire more knowledges and maturity, has been definitively decided since the last mobility program. This change was successful: our students passed the European mention exam with excellent marks and congratulations from the different examiners. The most important objective remains to be able to communicate in English in the sales field. The relationship between the salesman or woman and the customer in a selling point is a priority: the English assistant and the English teacher help the students to practice a lot of English and make them speak nonstop. The DNL (sales in English) are based on getting self-confidence and taking part in role plays. The section is composed of fifteen students in the upper sixth form in sales (they will get the equivalent of BTEC National Diploma in sales) who have trained themselves in the mobility program for three years, and who satisfy the required conditions such as maturity, motivation and sustained training. All of them will get a work placement as a salesman trainee in a shop (located in three or four towns in the East Sussex in England) and will be able to find their way thanks to the PPLC. They will be supervised. This new mobility program will take place in March-April 2016 (that means the final training period). The vocational and language skills in the selling field acquired in France will be put into practice in England. The difficulty to make the trainees become good at selling and the English sale conversation with the British customer which have always been considered as weak points since the early mobility programs, are now about to change if we consider our last experience in the UK. The preliminary conditions to take part in such a program of training period are clearly defined and accepted by the students and their families: they must have a strong motivation, train seriously and regularly and well behave. Most of the members showed their ability in the 2014/2015 mobility program. But the requirements aren\u2019t obvious for everyone. Because our students are quite young, we have to negotiate the content of the mobility program one at a time. They need a close supervision as well in work placement as in the host family. Because they are immature, we\u2019ve got to keep an eye on their behaviour. Moreover, our English partner must supervise them individually and permanently. We\u2019ve decided to pursue our partnership with Breakaway which is located in Seaford in the South East of England. They use to find internship for young students and they know how important it is and how great is the responsibility to supervise students who are not eighteen yet. They propose an easy geographic location, more reassuring supervision and they know how to monitor the progress of the students. This definition of the mobility program permits to eliminate the difficulties (described above), to reach the required purposes and generates the expected results: a cultural opening onto Europe, an English sales practice, a better adaptability, a personal enrichment and therefore makes the mobility program a success.
