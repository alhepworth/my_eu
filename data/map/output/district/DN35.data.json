Key to the evaluation process will be reports from the participants which will benchmark what learning objectives have been achieved and which will be compared and contrasted against the participants' intended outcomes prior to the commencement of the mobility utilising questionnaires received post-selection for the programme. Tables will be prepared to analyse the relative % success rates against each specific outcome. In addition all feedback from the participants, partners and management team will be collated and used to improve any future mobilities undertaken. The programme will be targeted at benefiting participants who are disadvantaged in the labour market which by virtue of the competitiveness of professional football the learners inevitably are.  Often players come from socially deprived areas, have learning difficulties and have limited interest or ability in academic education. Each participant will benefit from improved employability, enhanced career progression and greater job security following the mobility. A key objective for participants is that they will benefit from up-skilling and improved employability and so GTSET will track participants' employment history for a period of three years, updated annually, following the mobility in order to establish key data and trends regarding the direct correlation between a successful European mobility and improved employability. In addition GTSET teams' performance will similarly be measured annually for a period of 3 years following the mobility. The Project Manager, Graham Rodger - Community Manager will be key to the evaluation process. Knowing the candidates personally and being on the mobility he will be able to provide a balanced judgment in relation to individual benefits and enhanced learning for each participant. Following the mobility both participants and the partner organisations will be required to produce a final report identifying project outcomes and areas for improvement of future mobilities, critically assessing skills acquisition, language training and cultural integration.All parties' contributions will be correlated in an overall report evaluating the merits of the project in relation to the learning objectives and outcomes as well as identifying areas for improvement for subsequent coaching study visits within the EU. This final evaluation report will be publicised on the GTSET website.", "http://www.grimsbytownfitc.co.uk", "Grimsby Town Football in the Community Sports and Education Trust", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-013120_coordinator"]]}}, "9PY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Teaching and Learning through ICT: new technology, better results?", "Middlethorpe Primary Academy", 101597.0, 6, 6, "The title of this project is \"Teaching and Learning through ICT: new technology, better results?\" The advances in technologies have brought Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in daily life. Children are comfortable using ICT mainly for entertainment use. This provides an opportunity for teachers to use ICT in classrooms for educational purposes. Therefore, Ministries of Education of European countries have invested heavily in Information Communication Technology for use by teachers and pupils in schools. This has been in the form of computers and computer equipment (e.g., printers, scanners) in each classroom, computer labs in every school, interactive boards in many classrooms, projectors, educational software and teachers\u2019 in-service trainings in the use of ICT.\r\nSeveral children in our schools experience mild to severe difficulties mainly in literacy and mathematics. Therefore, we aim to improve pupils\u2019 skills and knowledge in specific thematic areas of literacy and mathematics and make learning more attractive and qualitative through the effective integration of ICT in learning. Particularly, we aim to maximize pupils\u2019 potential learning. Hence, we aim to enrich teachers' expertise of how to use ICT systematically during lessons, by following a more unified approach towards the use of technologies as learning tools, sharing good practices and exchanging ideas with teachers abroad. We also aim that through this project all participants will learn to communicate effectively with each other, respect and accept different opinions and cultures.\r\nSix schools from Cyprus, Poland, England, Turkey, Spain and Italy will participate in the project. Cooperation and communication among all partners is really important for the effectiveness of the project. Therefore, before the project activities take place, we will host a project meeting in the coordinating school, to share ideas and suggestions, so as to organise properly the activity plan for the whole two-years duration of the project and find ways to adapt it according to the needs of each school. Project meetings will be organised twice a year. During meetings, the progress of the project will be assessed and future activities will be discussed. Frequent contact will be kept, once a week and whenever is necessary, through email or skype sessions.\r\nSome project activities include the creation of a blog where partners can upload lesson plans, activities, recourses, photos, videos and make comments, the production of a handbook that will mainly include lesson plans, the organising of a conference by the end of the project so as to disseminate results, the preparation of short staff training events in different countries to support professional development of teachers, co-teaching lessons, establishment of Erasmus day and club.\r\nIt's of great importance to assess the effectiveness of the project. Therefore, we will interview students and teachers, give pre-, mid- and post-assessment tests to students, and pre- and post-questionnaires to students, teachers and parents involved in the project. We will also do observations in classrooms during lessons. Records will be kept for evaluation and discussion of results. \r\nDuring the project and after its completion, we expect that both students and teachers, as well as school organisations, will be improved in several areas and gain much from this collaboration. For example, students with or without difficulties, will improve their learning outcomes in literacy and mathematics. Also, learning will become more interesting and attractive for every student, and therefore, interest and participation during lesson will be increased. Classrooms will become active organisations, as every student will be actively involved in lesson activities. Moreover, teachers will learn how to integrate new technologies in classrooms and improve their learning approaches. Finally, each school will collect educational resources and material available for all teachers in every school.    \r\nThe project is expected to have positive impact and long-term benefits on the persons directly or indirectly involved. Students will develop problem solving skills and critical thinking and learn how to collaborate with others in a team effort. They will become ICT literate and more active learners. They will also learn to respect different opinions and cultures and establish personal friendships with students abroad. This project will give teachers the chance to become more open minded to ways and innovative practices using ICT in literacy and mathematics. They will also increase their level of digital competence, get familiar with teaching methodologies from teachers abroad and establish professional and personal relationships. As for parents, they will have the chance to become more actively involved in school activities. Finally, institutions will be able to strengthen links between them and the community around them.", "http://www.middlethorpeprimary.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-CY01-KA201-000185_2"]]}}}}
