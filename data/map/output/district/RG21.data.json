Some welding and NDT processes are high emitters of EMF and yet there is a recognised lack of knowledge in these sectors concerning the sources of EMF and its comparison to set exposure limit values. Without clear guidance and support, SMEs in the fabrication industry will be put at a competitive disadvantage as they incur a heavy and disproportionate financial cost in order to meet the required standards and ensure a safe working environment for their workers. EMFWELD will significantly lower SMEs\u2019 cost of compliance to Directive 2004/40/EC by providing an innovative, economic and easily accessible accurate EMF exposure risk assessment tool.  The envisaged software application will however require expertise and extensive research and understanding of welding processes and their associated EMF parameters; EMF exposure health effects, and software development. The SME-AGs of this consortium simply do not have the necessary research capabilities and have therefore engaged leading RTD performers (RTDPs) with world class knowledge in welding processes (TWI) and simulation of EMF health effects (CHALMERS) to develop the EMF concept.

By means of cost-optimization, EcoSwing targets a turbine of great relevance already to the present large-scale wind power market. The design principles of EcoSwing are applicable to markets with a wide range of turbine ratings from 2 MW to 10 MW and beyond.\n\nDespite technological successes in superconductivity, turbine manufacturers and generator suppliers are hesitant to apply HTS into the wind sector, because of real and perceived risks.

While the spread of a new pathogen, Nosema ceranae, is thought to be linked to bee depopulation episodes, there are currently no diagnostic tests for this species adapted to the needs of beekeepers. Consequently, there is an urgent and timely need to develop methods to help beekeepers detect for this virulent pathogen, so as to control its spread and reduce its dramatic economic impact on the beekeeping sector. The beekeeping associations of this proposal are determined to develop this diagnostic tool and to disseminate its use at European level.
