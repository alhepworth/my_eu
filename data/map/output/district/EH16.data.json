This will revolve around three aspects of European citizenship\u2014common values, common rules and a common European culture.\r\n\r\nThree European education networks will take part in this project; a network with special needs students in Paris, a junior High school in Madrid and another one in Edinburgh.\r\nNOO resulted from the assessment of the daily lives at school of French, Scottish and Spanish students belonging to those schools. Our students are faced with the same social difficulties, the same misbehaviors, and they struggle to succeed at school because of their family backgrounds which are often complicated (poverty, poor housing conditions and blended families). Furthermore, because of the political situation in Europe, with European people becoming more and more individual, the lack of open-mindedness, we have realized that our students were the first victims. In Paris, for example, instead of escaping from social and ethnic ghettos so as to discover the splendour of the city, they prefer to be imprisoned in their social environment. It is because of this tough social context that we are willing to build up together this cultural and social citizen project for students of various cultures and nationalities because they undoubtedly share the same  lives day after day.\r\n\r\nAll the students of the partnership will be concerned by NOO. An estimated thirty students (aged from 11 to 14) and a dozen of teachers of each country will take part in these European exchanges. Four exchanges are to be scheduled over a span of two years, including one early exchange in Paris and another one at the end of the period, and the two others in Madrid and Edinburgh. It is paramount that as many students as possible take part in these exchanges.\r\nThe main goal of the project is to arouse a feeling of European citizenship through three different aspects:\r\nFirstly, by assuring a common European culture, with the creation of a virtual guide entitled ,\u2019follow your hero\u2019. Students will play the role of a medieval character, or a French, or Scottish, or European character and they will follow the same historical  path.\r\n\r\nSecondly, by assuring that the rules for living together should be accepted, with the creation of a video game entitled\u2019 imagine your Europe\u2019; the game will stage the daily activities of a future European citizen in their environment  and their different reactions, be they appropriate or inappropriate.\r\nThere will also be two digital creations which will allow our students not to be mere consumers but real digital designers. Their skills as digital-native will be reinvested at school and in their future jobs.\r\nThirdly,by assuring the acquisition of common citizen values, through the creation of  a \u2018Rugby European Tour. A tournament which will rest on the values of unselfishness, solidarity, sacrifice, loyalty and team spirit conveyed by the game. Our students will have to organize practices and games; each student will have a role to play depending on their knowledge and qualities.\r\n\r\nThe project is therfore:\r\n -interdisciplinary: physical education,mathematics,history,geography,science, foreign languages).\r\n -a combination of primary and secondary education.\r\n -international: three European countries are involved in the process.\r\n\r\nSocial and civics skills: working in small groups, collaborating and living together, speaking in a foreign language, carrying out a scientific approach.\r\n\r\nSchool skills: general knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish school will deal with the communication of the project; the pupils will make a tv show which will highlight the various exchanges. Moreover, the making of a blog, of a twitter account and a radio show that will be developed by the media section in Hector berlioz will contribute to building up the project.\r\n\r\nExpected impacts:\r\n-reinforcing the feeling of being a European citizen and belonging to a group among the students, be it local, national, European and an eco-friendly environment.\r\n -expand the European culture\r\n -improve school conditions and allow a European influence in our schools\r\n -share teaching methods and reinforce the thirst for interdisciplinary for the people involved in the project.", "http://www.castlebrae.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA219-037422_1"], [2017, "Language Training", "Castlebrae Community High School", 25979.0, 1, 1, "Castlebrae Community High School is a six-year comprehensive secondary school serving the Greendykes area of Edinburgh, Scotland. We educate 117 pupils and are made up of 45 staff members. We are a Scottish Attainment Challenge School and one which has been invited to take part in the Positive Action School\u2019s Edinburgh-Paris Partnership Project. Both initiatives have been pushed forward to help raise attainment in Scottish schools based in poorer socio-economic locations.\r\nWe are applying for Erasmus+ KA1 funding for 7 of our staff members to participate in two of Le Francais En Ecosse\u2019s Language Immersion Courses, one in France and the other in Spain. The group of participants planning on going on these professional development opportunities include four teaching staff and 3 non-teaching staff, all enthusiastic about language learning and teaching. \r\nOur main objective as a School is to close the current attainment gap through excellence and equity. The ways in which we believe we can do this include the following; firstly, promoting foreign language learning in the Castlebrae Cluster from an early stage, in Primary 1 to S3, as part of the Scottish 1+2 Language Initiative. The most important factor in being able to do this is ensuring we have a confident team of staff who are skilled in the teaching of a foreign language. The target languages will then be embedded across the School and reinforced through extra-curricular activities. Trained staff will foster good practice throughout the Cluster by disseminating information taken from the Le Francais En Ecosse Immersion Courses in France and Spain. Workshops, presentations, shared resources on SharePoint and development days will allow our staff to reach our cluster colleagues effectively. \r\nSecondly, we aim to increase pupil uptake of languages in the senior phase with opportunities to work with European partners on exciting new projects. We want to provide our pupils with authentic experiences and up-to-date materials that will engage and inspire.  Staff on the immersion courses will be able to exchange ideas, make links with new schools and learn how to successfully develop European projects on platforms such as E-Twinning.\r\nThirdly, we need to develop better literacy skills across the curriculum. By learning about new methodologies and language teaching strategies, staff will be better equipped to facilitate the teaching of reading, talking, listening and writing across the curriculum in a way which will support all our learners in their literacy development. \r\nLastly, we aim to increase parental engagement with the School through various channels. We intend on sharing our achievements with language learning in our Castlebrae Bulletin, in our Newsletter, in the Community news website for East Edinburgh and on our School Twitter accounts. We want to have a group of trained staff who are confident about language teaching and its benefits so that they can engage parents at events such as Parent\u2019s Evening, our Course Choice Fair and special assemblies. \r\nOn applying for this funding, we plan to arrange several \u201cworking group\u201d meetings whereby staff will prepare for the courses and discuss important next steps. We will liaise with the course provider LFEE before commencing the course and then keep a detailed learning log of our activities during our time abroad. We will use this and the materials we collate to write up an evaluation of our training once we have returned. Long-term planning and evaluating will take place after the courses have finished to measure the impact of our training on the staff, School and wider community. \r\nWe aim to share our experiences nationally at public events and on our course provider\u2019s website to inform others of the opportunities available. In doing so, we hope to share good practice and instil confidence in staff to successfully engage with Scotland\u2019s Curriculum for Excellence and its initiatives. \r\nBy attending the two courses, we hope to gradually meet our School\u2019s objectives and raise the profile of Castlebare as an institution of excellence for all. Castlebrae is committed to life-long learning and will use the links made in France and Spain to successfully create new projects with a European dimension.
