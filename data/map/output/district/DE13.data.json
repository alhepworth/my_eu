The issue originates in schools when many girls make critical subject choices that will effectively lock them out from STEM in higher education and employment. This is coupled with the pervasive cultural stereotype of the male scientist or engineer and entrenched parochial attitudes. The gender in-balance in STEM subjects and in employment statistics are transnational concerns which extend to most EU countries, yet these themes do not feature prominently in teacher training while initiatives and resources launched by subject associations, education providers and others often tend to feature a \u2018top-down\u2019 approach.This project aims to increase the employment potential of all young Europeans, but especially girls, by improving their interest and engagement in STEM subjects through linking these to a wider awareness of global issues. Our partnership organisations have evidence through their existing work that bringing together STEM and global education often with an additional local dimension results in added motivation for girls and a sustained interest in these key subjects.  By working initially with carefully selected pilot schools we will avoid the shortcomings of the \u2018top-down\u2019 approach. In addition, practical solutions to some of global challenges and problems on which the target groups will work are best developed internationally if they are to have wider credibility. The project will facilitate much of this work through the development of digital skills and especially through the collaborative authoring of eBooks. This aspect capitalises on existing partner expertise. It enables dissemination to new and developing networks exploring this pedagogy, but most importantly brings with it an inclusive element as young people incorporate their virtually ubiquitous access to mobile technologies into their learning. Our partnership of nine institutions brings together NGOs, universities and secondary schools. Each will contribute their experience of international partnerships, global education, previous STEM activities and cutting edge research into mobile learning to the project, but they also have in common their capacity to innovate and to work collaboratively. Although the partnership has been specially created for this project all the partners have previously worked with at least one other member of the team. The planned activities will initially focus on the work of the universities, NGOs and pilot schools to develop and test a series of bespoke Global STEM Challenges aimed at engaging all pupils, but especially girls, in creating practical solutions to real world global issues. With support from their national partner organisation schools will collect, adapt and produce materials which they feel will support other pupils to take part in a focused STEM challenge. They will trial these with younger (or other) pupils in their own school and in their partner school. A further part of the brief will be for pupils to interview female researchers working on global issues in different countries and to incorporate these video clips in their materials.  These outputs will form the nucleus of an online Teacher Toolkit. The pilot schools will also start the process of constructing and testing in-service and pre-service training materials that would help to convince teachers and teacher trainers to adopt these methodologies. The training activities will populate an online Teacher Education Programme to be demonstrated to early adopters through a series of local dissemination sessions and Multiplier Events. All of these activities will be rigorously benchmarked, monitored and evaluated, including pupil evaluations, so providing the partnership with credible data and enabling them to work together on a series of academic papers and presentations, an essential part of the dissemination process.  Throughout these activities we will employ a \u2018bottom up\u2019 approach with carefully planned involvement of the pilot schools and their staff and pupils. For this reason pupils play a key role at the end of Year 1 in a Joint Pupil Mobility and staff at the end of Year 2 in a Learning Teaching and Training Activity.We envisage significant impact at local, regional, national and international levels. Our project partners, including pilot schools, have committed to incorporating project methodologies and outputs into their existing networks. These not only reach teachers and global educators but also influence policy makers and groups set up specifically to combat gender inequality in STEM.  By the end of the project we would also expect each partner to be part of a new network which would be established partly as a result of national dissemination sessions funded through the project and though other dissemination activities.", "http://www.deferrers.com", "UNIVERSITY OF HULL", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024360_4"], [2018, "Eigentijds leren", "The de Ferrers Trust", 42661.0, 7, 8, "You can\u2019t imagine everyday life without ICT. It is our job as educators to prepare pupils to modern-day society as much as we can. Our school\u2019s mission (translated from Dutch) is \u00ab great in learning and living \u00bb. We are continually making an introspection as to whether we are embracing the new developments in our education and whether we do this in a progressive manner. The parents of our students acknowledge this mission. To us, it\u2019s clear that ICT-developments make way for the renewal of our teaching. We strive to create a contemporary and challenging learning environment. That is why we\u2019re aiming at growing into a digital school of the 21st century. \r\n\r\nAlong with this ambition, we at the same time would like to find out how ICT can support our inclusion students. We would like to explore ways in which we can optimize helping students with learning disorders or other special needs. Moreover, it will be a challenge to make infrastructural adjustments to our existing classrooms but also incorporate modern facilities in the design of the new building yet to be constructed. That way we can organize our teaching according to contemporary and modern standards.\r\n\r\nICT will steadily occupy an increasingly prominent position in our teaching practice. On the one hand, we are stimulated by the fact that a huge number of teachers and students experience success in using ICT in the classroom. On the other hand, we observe that the media literacy and ICT competencies of our teachers show some room for improvement. The strategic planning exercise that our school did in 2015-16, taught us, amongst others, that students as well as teachers and stakeholders found that the focus on ICT use in a classroom context would improve our education\u2019s efficiency. Therefore, our main strategic priority for the years to come is the integrated use of digital learning tools in a classroom context, aiming at a higher learning efficiency among students and at a better preparation for life and learning in a digital world. That is, needless to say, also our goal in this KA1-project.\r\n\r\nEvery teacher has had a personal iPad at his/her disposal since December 2016. The introduction for pupils, on the other hand, will happen gradually from September 2017. \r\n\r\nOur teachers need examples of best practice and an advanced and specialised training. Our leadership team and staff coordinate the iPad\u2019s introduction and implementation in the classroom. It is our aim to get inspired by the schools that already have the know-how available.\r\n\r\nBy following an in-service training course and by carrying out job shadowing on various locations around Europe, we can offer a solution to our needs. 12 teachers and 3 school board members will participate in a structured course. 12 teachers, 2 board members, 1 staff member and 2 ICT coordinators will carry out job shadowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat way, we can provide teachers who gradually and thoughtfully integrate ICT in their classes. We are convinced that this can make learning more fun and profitable, which automatically will lead to higher qualification and/or chances of success. Furthermore, experience shows that the collaboration with other European schools and colleagues will continue after this project as well and that we will continue learning from each other.", "http://www.deferrers.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-BE02-KA101-046764_1"], [2017, "E-teach the teacher", "The de Ferrers Academy (a member of The de Ferrers Trust)", 31958.0, 3, 3, "Education in this era is becoming more digital due to the need of the labor market for prospective employees to have 21st century skills. This means that students have to be prepared and their digital skills need to be enhanced. More schools nowadays try to prepare the students via the use of iPads within their lessons. The use of iPads can only be succesful when teachers are equipped with knowledge on the range of available Apps and how to implement these Apps within their classrooms. Therefore we want to write manuals with lead the teachers step by step through the use of the App and suggest who the teachers can use the App for. The manuals will be made available online to download. Teachers can also use this website to find Apps suitable for their own class situation. The toolkit made during the Erasmusproject MTTEP (www.mttep.eu) will be used (www.mobilelearningtoolkit.com). Two of three partners worked together in this previous MTTEP-project. \r\n\r\nTarget groups of this project are teachers who are interested in professionalizing themselves in the field of providing digitial education. So the focus is not only on creating manuals and Apps, but also on how to implement in the correct pedagogical didactive way. Another target group are schoolmanagement to give them insight of possibilities of implementing iPad education within their school(s). \r\n\r\nThere are many Apps which can be used in the classroom or for preparation. Each partner will provide others with its own expertise and knowledge of Apps used in their own country.  The knowledge of each partner enhances the database on the website by adding their own manuals. By combining the expertise of different countries the database becomes usable for schools throughout Europe. \r\n\r\nBy setting up online and offline meetings in between the schools tutorials, manuals and explanations are produced for teachers, who use Apps in their classroom. In total four sessions in which teachers will work together during exchanges on the end products. Two transnational meetings (one at the beginning and one at the end) will be used for projectorganization. End products will be made available via a website which will be set up during the project.", "http://www.deferrers.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035703_2"]]}}, "0RB": {"nhs": {"data": [["RTG", "Burton Hospital", "nhs_RTG02"]]}}}}
