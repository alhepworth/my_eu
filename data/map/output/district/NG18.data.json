Mobility and lifelong learning is a key concept in this strategy.  \r\nMobility indicators, especially in the field of vocational education and training are low in Europe.  By 2020, the goal of European Council is that at least 6% of all 18-34 year-olds with a VET background be granted a learning experience abroad. According to Cedefop Mobility Scoreboard, that monitors VET mobility, EU performance for 2017 in terms of ensuring quality for mobility is considered unsatisfactory.\r\nThe adoption of ECVET (European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training) draws attention to the capacity of individual countries to facilitate a system to support and monitor progress in ECVET implantation. It is being increasingly recognized, that apart from system capacity, it is crucial that teachers have the knowledge and skills to promote such learner mobility. This raises the issue of initial and continuing professional development for teachers.  \r\nIn order to promote successful learner mobility and for greater progress in the adoptation of ECVET across Europe, we have to address also VET teachers professional development needs.  It is being increasingly recognized that teachers are an important key to unlocking the potential of ECVET and they need special competences to support learners mobility.  A special attention will be paid to the learners with educational difficulties to support inclusive education in VET programs and in VET teacher education. \r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the project is to make students and teachers better equipped to work in international environments both at home and abroad.  The project partners (University of Tartu (EE), Tartu Vocational Education Centre (EE), University of Applied Sciences in Jyvaskyla (FI), Vocational College Lappia, Tornio (FI), West Nottinghamshire College (UK), CESIE (IT) and Acta Center (RO) recognize the need to enhance international mobility in VET training programs in their institutions. Considering that context, our understanding is that often the bottleneck of mobility is related with VET institutions` teachers, who have limited experience and readiness to work with international partners.  The Project provides a practical tool  for VET institutions, which supports and encourages international cooperation and staff/student mobility. \r\nThere are two main objectives for the project: \r\nFirst, create functional and sustainable strategic partnership to facilitate the internationalization of VET programs.  The strategic partnership is the working body,  which is necessary to implement the project successfully and generate value for institutions, countries and Europe in general. \r\nSecond, to create a specific  tool for internationalization, which  is missing today. We generate a digital environment (hereinafter named Platform), which provides support and practical help to  VET institutions (as an Intellectual Output).  That is a multidimensional environment to assist VET  program teachers/trainers/students to develop intercultural competences and reflection skills before, during and after mobility period. The platform supports international mobility; prepares teachers and students; help them through practical advice and shares valuable experience.    \r\nTraining module methodology will be based on new approach to learning. This approach emphasize the significance of the learners own contributions to their learning process through initiative-taking and active involvement. This is the reason, why we will develop a flexible, interactive and engaging training module to enhance international mobility. We are going to apply the methodology of experiential and hands on learning. \r\nProject impact and longer term envisages: MOBVET project will result in increased number of mobile VET teachers and learners in Erasmus+ Programme countries and provision of high quality mobility through all stages of study abroad.

Both, young people and adults are keen to choose their own speed and sequence of learning, combine different education forms and levels as well as blend informal learning and work experience into their individual learning paths. Multicultural and international environments, and the need to accommodate a growing number of students with a different mother language or skills background add new dimensions and challenges to VET schools. In order to respond to various student group expectations, the pre-admission phase into VET institutions is becoming more crucial. \r\n\r\nThere is a plethora of research evidence to demonstrate the positive impact that good quality and timely information, advice and guidance (IAG) can have on learning and career decision making. The implications of the weaknesses of poor information, advice and guidance (IAG) for learners, as well as for providers and the wider economy, are potentially far reaching and the consequences of poor decision-making on entry to the VET institutions and vocational education can impact on the retention, achievement and progression of learners which can, in turn, affect the supply of skills to the labour market. Good quality and timely pre-entry information, advice and guidance (IAG) fulfils an important role in supporting learners to address diverse and complex needs and helps overcome barriers to access to the VET institutions and vocational education.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to accumulate the best practices from the partner countries in order to develop information, advice and guidance (IAG) methods and tools to improve pre-admission and admission phase efficiency in VET institution.

Furthermore they should work the data up and integrate them into the right context. This results in new and more complex requirements for the employees \r\nAn essential concern of this project is the improvement of the cooperation in the area of topics which are relevant for the practice between vocational schools and enterprises. The latter could give support to vocational schools by supervising the apprentices in specific operational processes and by providing the technical equipment. In addition the handling and the knowledge of complex technology becomes amplified. \r\nAt the request of the enterprises, the cooperation should take place on the national and European level to guarantee a wide-ranging exchange of experiences concerning the work-based learning.\r\nAnother intention of the project is informal spreading of the \u201cDual System\u201d based on the level of practice.

The ability of VWNC students to perform under pressure has become a serious issue for both the college and the students, impacting on the results they achieve and their preparedness for progression onto university and employment and the pressures they will face in those environments.  Current strategies support students with stress and anxiety  to some extent, but are not always proving to be very effective at improving performance of the students under pressure. \r\n\r\nThe project pinpoints a particular need which is increasing and impacting on the wellbeing of young people. Although it is accepted that for all people exams and assessments can be a stressful experience, a growing number of young people seem ill equipped with the strategies to cope and this can disproportionately affect their outcomes and hence life chances. Our project will focus specifically on giving students, teachers and trainers from participating institutions an opportunity to share their own perceptions on dealing with issues around the pressure and trial new strategies as adopted by partner institutions to help foster resilience and to reduce anxiety. It is hoped that this will aid students to perform better under pressure and get the best possible results from their courses.

Firstly, students with anxiety who are undertaking exam based qualifications and secondly students on exam based qualifications not currently presenting any symptoms of anxiety. This is in recognition that some strategies we aim to introduce will be preventative whilst others will help minimise anxiety levels. While the UK group will focus on those undertaking A Levels and/or Applied General qualifications, the project partners will select groups that undertake appropriate assessments that require students to perform under pressure and deal with any potential anxiety issues to ensure they perform to their full potential. \r\n\r\nTransnationally\r\nVWNC students come from a range of schools with no discernible differences in terms of student resilience to the pressures of exam performance. As there is no hard evidence of work being undertaken in the UK to address this issue, we are therefore currently following what would be best practice in terms of support for these students in the UK and it is not having the type of impact we would expect.

These renowned institutions are closely involved with local companies for student training schemes which our students' training mobilities will be able to benefit from. The past students' exchange programs have been built upon personnal mutual trust between teachers from both institutions.Existing partnership will then strenghten through this new experience. Once introduced to the new departments from our partners' institutions, new project holders will be able to prepare their future mobility programs with the use of  the E-Twinning online platform. Thanks to the ERASMUS+ funding program, 12 students and accompanying persons and 5 staff mobilities are planned for 2016-2017. Staff persons will benefit from their training along with students, both becoming ambassadors for European Mobility funding programs, awarded with their EUROPASS Certificate.", "http://www.wnc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-023625_2"]]}}, "5BY": {"cordis": {"data": [[1262304000000, 1333152000000, "Microwave Drying for the Rapid Remediation of Flooded Buildings", "Spectrum Franchising Ltd", "Our idea is to develop microwave technology which will reduce drying times in buildings after flooding events. A single Microdry unit will run off mains electricity be capable of drying a room in just 10% of the time taken by current technologies. We will develop an intelligent control system that will measure the reflected microwaves to determine residual moisture content and adjust the power output accordingly to maximise efficiency. The Microdry system will require no human intervention and will communicate to an end user when the drying process is finished. The magnitude and frequency of floods are likely to increase in the future as a result of climate change i.e. higher rainfall intensities and rising sea levels. Equally, the impact of flood events will increase, because in excess of 50 million European citizens now live in areas at risk of flooding with business and industry also located in such areas. Current drying operations require up to 8 weeks before remedial work can be undertaken on the building. This extends the time required before a building can revert to normal use with economic and social consequences. To remedy this situation we need to develop an emitter to direct the microwave energy to target areas without regular human intervention. This will use a feedback system to measure moisture content and actively control microwave power to the emitter. Telecommunications components will provide communication between the unit and operator and comprehensive safety features will ensure that microwave hazards are eliminated.", 32156.0, 1167188.0, 5, 8, "MICRODRY", "http://microdry.pera.com", "http://www.rainbow-int.co.uk", null, "fp7_107639_994868085"]]}}, "5QJ": {"nhs": {"data": [["RK5", "Mansfield Community Hospital", "nhs_RK5BL"]]}}}}
