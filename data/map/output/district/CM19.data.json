If the control electronics were to be migrated to the engine core environment, it would be subjected to steady-state temperatures in the order of 2500C, rising to 3000C during transient engine behaviour. In this environment, today\u2019s electronic control units would exhibit inferior performance, reduced reliability and extremely short lifetimes.\n\nThe prime aim of the HiTME project is therefore to develop a safety-critical electronic system which can operate reliability when installed in the severe engine core environment. Central to this objective, will be the development, to TRL6, of electronic components and material technologies along with smart thermal and packaging designs that make the concept feasible.\n\nIn order to design a product capable of withstanding the high temperatures associated with an engine core installation, whilst still maintaining performance (accuracy) and life, fundamental advancement in key technological areas will be necessary.
