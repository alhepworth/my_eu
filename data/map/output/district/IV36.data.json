We feel that working in the intercultural competences of local communities throughout Europe is a key element for a healthier relationship between all parties and a better Europe towards the future, therefore an international team of trainers and partners prepared a training course very focused on intercultural learning in the field of youth and alternative approaches towards it. Taking different points of view (arriving and hosting) to the situations and possible conflicts, we will be exploring and using different tools that youth workers can use when organizing activities related to cultural diversity, but also giving space for discussion and theoretical considerations.This context gave birth to \"Game of Cultures: Active Communities for the Inclusion of Young Migrants and Refugees\u201d.  It is an international 8 days training course that will host 30 participants from 10 countries and partner organisations, plus 3 trainers and 2 support staff (total number of participants: 35 people).The main aim of this TC is to support, empower and develop the competences of youth workers so that they can act on their local youth communities in order to create multiplier agents, promoting and encouraging intercultural dialogue in their local communities in order to enhance its openness to the inclusion of migrants and refugees.The main objectives are: - Reflect on the current European and National realities concerning the flux of migrants and refugees and their inclusion;- Learn and develop knowledge, competences and tools to work on diversity, intercultural learning and intercultural dialogue;- Create awareness of the importance that influence of culture has on person\u2019s behaviour and identity;- Raise awareness on the cultural differences between different European countries and to what extent this impacts the inclusion/exclusion of migrants and refugees in different societies;- Develop tools, activities and sustainable strategies to promote inclusion of migrants and refugees;- Explore the potential of young people as actors of inclusion and change on a local level.- Share good practices related to youth work, inclusion and active participation- Acknowledge the Erasmus+ Programme as a tool for intercultural learning, Youth Work and inclusion;- Develop an informal network of youth workers and youth leaders tackling the Refugee Crisis and promoting follow up projects and initiatives.The training course will be facilitated by experienced trainers, using methods of NFL and will include input sessions, experience-exchange sessions, reflection-groups and discussions.

Increasing levels of youth unemployment, less job security, increased social tensions, fragmented communities and lack of appropriate support in life transitions can lead to young people feeling hopeless, directionless or even heading in a negative direction. However young people harbour the potential to make deep and wide contributions to a more positive sustainable future and in creating healthy resilient communities. In order for this to happen young people must be supported in stepping into their own strengths and qualities. They need to learn that Leadership can take many forms and that everyone has the potential to lead in their own unique way.This non-formal education project focuses on developing the competences needed to support young people to become leaders in their lives, communities and work, developing methods and tools to help them cultivate their own leadership style and on supporting them to recognise and utilise their resources and become an active force in society.We will use a range of non-formal methods including: large & small group work; team building activities; nature-based methods; storytelling; discussions; reflection and self-assessment.

The project will innovate new pedagogical tools that utilise previous project-based learnings and needs analyses with a strong evidence base that interactive entrepreneurial education pedagogies such as Game-Based Learning (GBL) and Educational Live Action Role Playing (edularp) can be used to deeply educate and positively affect educational attainment and harness creativity. Using the the deep experience of social enterprise development and youth work in social entrepreneurship training held within the project partnership, we will initiate a youth-to-youth facilitator network, create an online learning platform, and develop open-licensed tools that will be available for youth organisations outside the partnership to use within their own social entrepreneurship trainings across Europe. \r\n\r\nECO GAMER will  resource, implement, disseminate and evaluate three central intellectual outputs in order to reach our target beneficiaries and achieve our objectives:\r\n\r\n1) Create a holistic and scientifically sound ECO Assessment available in different online and offline formats for both individuals and groups to map and assess their lifestyles through the lens ecovillage design principles: a framework used to depict community regeneration of social and natural environments and active contribution to the UN SDGs through participatory design in four dimensions of sustainability: social, cultural, ecological and economy.\r\n\r\n2) Use Game-Based Learning principles to create an innovative and experiential social entrepreneurship, collaborative leadership and community building training in the form of a live action project-development and implementation ECO Game, playable by both individuals and groups, online and offline. The ECO Game is an edularp game: an actual live action activity where local youth will implement projects and solutions in their communities in real-time. The Game will support players to connect to their purpose, strengthen community participation, build self-confidence, practice collaborative leadership skills, and empower youth with the spirit of social entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n3) Build an online ECO Online Platform to showcase the accomplishments, skills, projects and implemented solutions of participants through interactive maps, profile pages and scoring systems connected with the ECO Game and the ECO Assessment. In parallel the platform will include search functions to find ongoing Games and youth Game Facilitators online. \r\n\r\nThe target beneficiaries of ECO GAMER fall into two core groups: \r\n\r\na) Disadvantaged youth - Primarily youth identified to be from disadvantaged background, unemployed, representative of marginalised groups and peoples with low levels of education. A special focus will be put on young unemployed people, including graduates, and those in rural deprived areas. \r\n\r\nb) Budding young social entrepreneurs - Interested in developing social enterprises that will benefit the core target group of disadvantaged and marginalised youth, we will target youth with budding passion and drive to tangibly impact their communities.\r\n\r\nIn total we will hold 9 multiplier events in the UK, Italy, Egypt, Portugal, and Switzerland. A total of 172 direct beneficiaries through the multipliers. In addition, we will hold a blended youth training event to train 25 Game Facilitators (including online mentoring) and a youth worker training for another 25.

Education for transformation is education that empowers people to involve actively for a sustainable development of our society. In the frame of the ecovillage-movement, but in other contexts as well, educational programs and concepts have been developed that empower people to get actively involved in change for society. This kind of educational work shall be strengthened and internationalised through this project. As an additional goal we strive to develop our organisations to better reach out to people with a migration background.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concrete goals of the project are:\r\n\r\nGeneral project goals:\r\n\r\n1. to enlarge the pool of German trainers who can offer highly qualified courses in education for transformation for an international audience\r\n\r\n2. innovation transfer: to bring methods and course formats to Germany that are not yet existing here, but in other European countries\r\n\r\n3. to open up for new target-groups for education for transformation (international participants, people with migration background)\r\n\r\n4. to ensure an appealing, competent management of international/-cultural learning events in our members' organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\n\r\nIn the frame of an open project, our plan is to offer a learning opportunity abroad for all together 100 people who are involved in the field of education for transformation. GEN is explicitly open for applications from people who have not been active in the context of GEN before, but who are working in the field of education for transformation in other contexts or are working with migrants and want to include education for transformation in their work. The goal of GEN is not only the improvement of its own educational work and the work of its member organisations, but as well a strengthening of the field of education for transformation as a whole.\r\n\r\nWe are convinced that for this kind of educational work it is especially effective if it happens in an international frame, as it is highly motivating to become aware that in different countries and cultures people are involved in building a world worth living, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to reach these goals, the following activities are planned:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Jobshadowing (20 mobilities)\r\n\r\na. Management / Logistics / Organisation\r\n\r\nb. with organisations that work with people with migration background\r\n\r\nb.

Teaching assignments (15 mobilities)\r\n\r\n    - with our international partner organisations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\n\r\nAs soon as we get the positive answer on the grant request, we will create two part-time jobs for the work related to it - or increase the number of hours for our part-time staff that is already employed. We will inform our member organisations, our staff and all organisations known to us that are active in education for transformation or that are working with migrants about the possibilities to qualify their staff and to internationalise their work through this project.\r\n\r\nWe expect applications for the trainings with concrete details about the expected learning outcomes and how these learning outcomes shall contribute to reach the set goals of the particular organisation. We will choose the participants with the help of these applications. In the learning agreements (individually for each mobility; between participant, their employers, GEN and the receiving organisation) and the memorandums of understanding (between GEN and the receiving organisations) we will set the agreements and learning goals, and also declare how the acquired competencies will be applied within the organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this project we expect an expansion and improvement in quality for the offers of education for transformation, not only for GEN and its member organisations, but as well for many other organisations working in that field. New course-formats that are already applied successfully in other EU-countries will be brought to Germany and established course-formats will be nourished with new impulses through international experiences. We expect as well that through the newly established contacts new projects and course formats will arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the project, the target groups for seminars and courses in education for transformation shall be enlarged in two directions: There shall be more seminars that have an international scope with an international target audience, and additionally we want to focus on how the international target group of people with migration background in Germany could be adressed more efficiently.", "http://www.findhorncollege.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA104-000640_3"], [2014, "Youth-led Societal Innovation for Resilience", "GLOBAL ECOVILLAGE NETWORK", 127917.0, 7, 7, "The Youth-led Societal Innovation for Resilience, (ySI4R) project uses youth worker education to facilitate youth participation in one of the greatest challenges of our time, climate change.

Creating a low carbon society needs active engagement of civil society. This project aims to assist and support groups starting community-led sustainable projects with an adult education response, especially in terms of social skills as it turns out that many projects are failing due to lack of the necessary social and group communication skills. The project is created in response to a need for such increased levels of awareness and collaborative practice  to spark change and development in a specific, sustainable direction. This project addresses the need for an integrated approach in Education for Sustainable Development that blends ecological, economic, social and cultural aspects in a balanced way. \r\n\r\nPartnership\r\nThe nine organisations that form SCIPP represent large groups of sustainable communities and grassroots initiatives throughout Europe. All project partners are active in the field of adult education for sustainable development in which ecological, economical, social and cultural aspects are integrated in a holistic approach.

Four of the partners have been involved in the development of the Ecovillage Design Education. The Italian and Spanish partners have further developed national programmes to assist the development of new projects, communities and eco-initiatives. In a series of six transnational meetings the existing training materials will be transformed in a collective and co-creative way into an Incubator Framework for Incubator Training and a supplementary TOT (training of trainers). Besides these training materials a comprehensive ICT e-learning platform will be created to back up the Incubator Framework. This will include an innovative support system for online consultancy.\r\n\r\nDissemination\r\nThe project results will be disseminated through the wider networks of the partners consisting of networks of ecological communities, on both local, regional, national, European and international levels by utilizing existing channels, both internal and external. The project partners will provide a valuable and legitimate contribution to the adult education sector, but add a more innovative and entrepreneurial dimension in also wider green business circles.    \r\n \r\nAt a regional and local level the project will provide incubator trainings to local rural and urban communities. The project and materials will also be presented nationally to relevant stakeholders, like adult education providers within the non formal education sector, but also to universities, research institutes and students, to municipalities and decision making bodies, NGO\u2019s with similar goals.

We see that in the world of continous degradation of ecosystems, declining biodiversity, changing climate, peak of natural resources (especially oil), increase of population and instability of economical systems, there is a need for transition to stable, just and sustainable society. This can be achieved through focusing on four aspects of sustainability - social, environmental, ecological and cultural on community level.   \u00c4ngsbacka sees the project as one example of sustainable development for all of Europe.

Many youth carry a strong vision of contributing to sustainable development of their societies while at the same time being able to make a living, raise a family and contribute to the resilience of their communities. However, there is a lack of inspiring examples, a lack of support and necessary skills to manifest this vision. The innovative Pattern Language Curriculum, called the 'Evoneers' Journey', a learning journey for social innovation and entrepreneurship, developed by an Erasmus+ partnership project, SIRCle (Social Innovation for Resilient Communities), is capable of filling this gap. This new capacity-building for youth project, called \"Social Innovation for Resilient Communities - Living Earth - SIRC-LE\" builds on the work of the strategic partnership, SIRCle. The partners of SIRCle have agreed to take the developed materials into this new project; to share them with LOES and test their application in African contexts too. The educational tools that have been developed in SIRCle have been translated to seven European languages, and are now ready to be spread. Yet, they have not been adapted for youth, and Denmark is not amongst the countries thus far involved.  Now, 4 partner organizations, from the UK, Denmark, Ghana and Cameroon, will collaborate on a youth project to share, adapt and add to the existing learning tools in order to contextualize them for the African context, for Denmark, and, most especially, for youth in all 4 countries. In this project, new Learning Patterns and Learning Exercises that are specifically geared to the needs of youth will be developed and translated to French and Danish.

Permaculture, a powerful tool for ecological resource building and for societal integration and citizenship practice, needs to be practiced not just by the landed, but also by the landless \u2013 students, school children, youth, apartment-dwellers, itinerant travelers, migrants, those suffering forced displacement and social exclusion.\r\n\r\nWe have made some strides towards these goals.  But we need to do more. We need more substantial improvement in the breadth and depth of our permaculture knowledge, be better equipped to be able to think about permaculture in new ways and apply it in untried contexts and thus better reach new and marginalized groups.  We need exposure to permaculture practices in other societal contexts, through experience-exchange at permaculture-rich international gatherings, through immersion in advanced courses not available in Sweden, and through contact with practictioners in countries with a more developed permaculture practice.  We need to improve our organizational and administrative capacity, including our capacity to run and promote our diploma system for training new permaculture teachers. \r\n\r\nOur objectives summarized thus are:\r\n1. To more successfully adapt traditional permaculture to a contemporary Swedish context, one that can adequately respond to modern-day local challenges, such as the need for greater social inclusion and more active citizenship, as well as to international challenges such as migration, forced displacement, and global climate change.  \r\n2.

The information gotten through the Europass mobiliity document, in addition to the information we get in direct communication with each participant will give us a more complete picture of their experience and learning from the mobility, that will then be shared through blog posts on the association home page, through articles in the nordic permaculture magazine, with the partner organisations for their work evaluating their course or event. Results will also be summarized and shared through EPALEs open library, and at fairs and events.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe additional capacity of our permaculture teachers will lead to a diversified range of courses and creative solutions that tailor permaculture to a contemporary Swedish context, including greater accessibility for previously marginalized groups.\r\nThe training and exposure to England's developed diploma system will lead to an improvement in our Nordic diploma system for permaculture, in particular for our Swedish diploma system tutors and tutees. \r\nOur more developed international contact network will increase the bilateral flow of activities and teacher exchange to and from Sweden, also benefiting European permaculture practice at large.\r\nThe possibility that other countries will turn to Sweden for models of contemporary permaculture practice will increase", "http://www.findhorncollege.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA104-038993_1"], [2014, "Med \u00f8kosamfund som l\u00e6ringsrum - i Danmark og Europa", "Findhorn Foundation College", 25413.0, 4, 4, "The Danish Association of Ecovillages (L\u00d8S) is an umbrella organisation for the Danish ecovillages. The association  turned 20 years in 2013 and is the first national network of ecovillages, globally. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL\u00d8S experience a growing focus among its members to create business in the ecovillages, focused on developing more qualitative educational activities, which are in high demand. Recent phenomena like the financial crisis and climate change lead to an increased focus on the transition to sustainability and the ecovillage movement can reply with its practical examples of transition initiatives and the building of sustainable human communities. Various groups are looking towards the ecovillage society for experience and knowledge. Education and training is therefore a priority growth area for L\u00d8S. However, there is a need for capacity building among teachers, both in terms of volume, methodology and content. Thus, L\u00d8S has chosen over a 1-year period to provide 10 teachers with staff training abroad. All are committed to educational activities in their local context, but are also active on the national scene, through L\u00d8S. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEcovillages already have a strong European network, organised through the Global Ecovillage Network (its Europe section in particular) and Gaia Education, responsible for the training part. It even has its own training curriculum, in a 4 week course based on the four dimensions on sustainability. It is called GAIA 's Ecovillage Design Education and is developed by adult education trainers throughout years of experience. Most education in the ecovillage society takes place within this educational framework. But the resource base in Denmark is not strong, since not many have taken a full 4 weeks EDE. That is the background for L\u00d8S to send 2 x 2 trainers for EDE training for 4 weeks in some of Europe 's leading providers of EDE courses, being Sieben Linden in Germany and Findhorn in Scotland. The learning objective is that the 4 people acquire a deeper understanding of the EDE in practice and the nesesary skills and motivation to arrange 4 weeks EDE courses in Denmark in 2016. Furthermore, the project is about expanding the resource base for L\u00d8S to also send teachers from Denmark elsewhere in Europe, as an ambition.

In addition to these 2+2+2  staff trainings L\u00d8S will send 4 people to the GEN Europe conference in Germany, summer of 2014, to network and become inspired by a week's abundance of interesting workshops. Previously mostly the organizational people in L\u00d8S have participated in the GEN conference, but it is actually becoming increasingly a venue for trainers and facilitators to meet and inspire each other with their \u2018best practises\u2019. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the mentioned activities are centered within a wish and a need for quality development, while at the same time seeking to mobilize, inspire and motivate to an increased European focus among the participants from Denmark, who will be encouraged to engage in further building of learning partnerships etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teachers in L\u00d8S are ' ordinary people ' who live in ecovillages, often in remote areas where European activity is not normal. Therefore, this project is anticipated to resonate, lead to pride, curiosity and some publicity in these local communities. The long-term objective of the mobility program is to create more jobs for teachers, requiring quality assurance of the existing and future educational educational activities and inspiration from European ecovillages that have managed to create dedicated learning centers. Therefore, L\u00d8S have deliberately chosen three course providers that have been doing exactly this, which L\u00d8S has as a long-term strategy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of the mobility prorgamme can be found through a wider and more qualitative range of courses as well as increased professionalism, in particular, demonstrated through a more active involvement in the RCE, the Danish Network for Education for Sustainable Development. Even the nominated UN decade of Education for Sustainable Development will end here in 2014; L\u00d8S has found a niche that no one else can fill out - namely the use of the lived life in ecovillages as an innovative \u2019live and learn\u2019 environment. GAIA's  EDE curriculum must be contextualized through European mobility experiences and then local application, for L\u00d8S to create a landmark. Furthermore, L\u00d8S will experience the increasing European cohesion when it comes to education for sustainable development.

It can address creativity, youth participation and employability, critical thinking and social responsibility. \r\nEurope at the moment is facing major problems. Among these, the dis-empowerment of young people who feel marginalised from society, can't find their place and don't know (or forget) how to realise their potential in life. \r\n\r\nOn the other side, phenomena like hate speech and online violence (of which \u201ccyberbullying\u201d is only one of its aspects that affects young people directly: 52% of students experience it, and 33% receive some form of threats online. 84% of all cyberbullying takes place on facebook.

We will discuss the new needs for awareness, ethics and knowledge that come with the social and digital era; \r\n\r\n- to explore the concept of \u201ctransformational storytelling\u201d: using storytelling as an innovative tool to address change and personal development; \r\n\r\n- to use elements of gamification to make youth work more attractive and accessible to young people (especially marginalised YP); \r\n\r\n- to create an international network of youth workers and organisations, able to use storytelling to develop skills and methods and to have an innovative impact on local levels. \r\n\r\nThe activities will be based on non formal and experiential learning methodologies, all centred on different aspects of Storytelling. We will work on the most classic and traditional forms (sitting around the fire) to the most contemporary, like cinema, comics and videogames. \r\n\r\nThe expected learning outcomes for the participants are: \r\n\r\n- to be trained on, and receive information about, innovative approaches based on Storytelling, illustrating specialised concepts such as the Monomyth, the Way of Council, Gamification - and the work methodologies related to them - combining theory, practice and sharing reflections and good practice tips with trainers and colleagues;\r\n\r\n- to get more proficient in the understanding and use for educational purposes of Comics, Videogames, Board Games - all media very popular in the youth culture; \r\n\r\n- to increase awareness and learn how to better tackle in youth work their potential negative effects, as well: the risk of addiction and escapism from reality, the possible manipulation and propaganda uses that can be done by authorities, political and social actors, governments. \r\n\r\nWorking with games and stories in education is our biggest passion, and we sincerely wish to see more and more people trained to use them, and as enthusiastically and sincerely as we do.", "http://www.coyoteinitiatives.com", "Coyote Initiatives CIC", "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA105-035212_coordinator"], [2017, "GOSHH educational learning and leadership development program", "Findhorn Foundation", 22691.0, 3, 3, "GOSHH is the only Gender, Orientation, Sexual Health and HIV organisation for the Mid West of Ireland.

Some of these young people need to find back their passion and know when they are in their elements. At the same time, non-formal learning which takes place within the framework of youth projects (in the Erasmus+ programme and beyond) provides very valuable learning experiences for young people, e.g. communication and the ability to work in teams, developing the habit of staying involved in an activity on a regular basis or at least for some time, taking responsibility etc. The course wants to bring people who work in the youth field, on a journey on the \"yellow brick road\" and provide them tools and inputs which might help them to be more aware of themselves, their passion and their element.

This leads to marginalization, lack of integration and participation among young people. The project aims to tackle this issue and these problems, to raise awareness on how to fight racism with all its forms. In the life we are leading now segregation, xenophobia, discrimination and many other forms of negative human interaction are widely spreading. Accordingly, working on belittling such behaviors is a matter of priority because it is affecting the livelihood of people on daily basis. Therefore, we are targeting throughout our training course two things; first, understanding the cause of such acts and second the best practices to avoid and fight them with young people. \r\n\r\nThe title of the training explains its content; \"face\" represents the idea of standing against and fighting and at the same time it is the human face that makes all the difference; \"race\" projects the word racism as well as symbolizes the fact that life turned into a non stopping race where everybody runs in different directions. Consequently, \"Face the Race\" will be a training course that will deluge into the different perspectives and stereotypes present in human behavior in order to enhance unity and harmony rather than conflicts or dissonance.  \r\n\r\nThe training course gathers together 28 young people from 7 different countries in order to provide educational & theoretical background on how to work with young people to combat racism and build tolerance and equality. Furthermore the project aims to develop the skills and competences of less privileged young people facing cultural, economical, religious or social obstacles to empower and encourage them to take action against racism. \r\n\r\nWe also aim to evaluate exciting human rights educational tools and to develop new tools and methods to be used in non-formal educational framework to combat racism and discrimination.

This project is a direct result of a seminar for youth workers and young leaders, representatives of national ecovillage networks, coordinated by Mimundo (Danish Ecovillage) in Denmark in 2016. A group of people in representation of 10 ecovillages wrote this application together during the seminar.\r\nThe partners work in the field of education for sustainable development and are all part of the ecovillage movement. An ecovillage is an intentional or traditional community that is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes to regenerate social and natural environments. Nowadays there is a strong interest among young people in sustainability issues in general and specifically in ecovillages and their holistic and practical approach to a sustainable lifestyle.\r\nMost of the project partners have been working mostly in the adult education sector until now. They want to respond to the great demand perceived in young people and intensify the participation of their young members.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\r\n- PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT, enabling young people to learn new skills, develop personal resilience, take initiative and learn to critically assess different ways of living.  \r\n- STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL NETWORK OF YOUNG PEOPLE interested in sustainability and ecovillage life in Europe, both in rural and urban areas; reducing this geographical gap; engaging young people into intercultural dialogue and cooperation.  \r\n- INCREASE YOUTH WORK IN ECOVILLAGES, enabling young people to explore different employment opportunities at or inspired by ecovillages and enabling ecovillages to reach out to larger numbers of young people.\r\n\r\nThis is to be achieved through a Youth Exchange of 20 young participants supported by 4 group leaders, associated with the respective partner organisations. The young participants attending are coming from both rural and urban areas and are interested in low impact ways of living and sustainability. The exchange will take place in March 2018 in the well-established and pioneering ecovillage and community of Findhorn, Scotland, where young people will get in contact with examples of low impact living in rural areas. Participants will enjoy hands on activities with the community and will be encouraged to explore what ecovillages are doing to tackle the global ecological and social crisis with a focus on personal development, active citizenship and employability.  \r\n \r\nOne purpose of this is sharing of best practice and examples of the youth participation at a local level for mutual inspiration and new impulses, promoting international support for youth leading ecovillage lifestyles, and for young leaders to self-organize the exchange.\r\nThe Findhorn Foundation College, community, and ecovillage has a long history of facilitating and teaching sustainability practices. During the youth exchange, these resources and faculty will be made available in sessions encouraging participants to embrace and engage with the everyday life of the community. To support the interactive nature of this Youth Exchange, group leaders will also facilitate exploration time through interactive and participatory methods and self organized seminars.

An ecovillage is an intentional or traditional community that is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes to regenerate social and natural environments. The four dimensions of sustainability (ecology, economy, the social and the cultural) are all integrated into a holistic approach.Nowadays there is a strong interest among young people in sustainability issues in general and specifically in ecovillages and their holistic approach to a sustainable lifestyle. Many young people are asking for ways to visit ecovillages and learn more.Most of the project partners have been working mostly in the adult education sector until now, with a limited amount of activity in the area of youth work - even the youth is represented in most ecovillages as a group. They this want to respond to the great demand perceived in young people and intensify their work in the youth sector, including international collaboration projects.Therefore, the following objectives have been chosen for this project:- INCREASE YOUTH WORK IN ECOVILLAGES, enabling ecovillages to reach out to  larger numbers of young people- INTERNATIONALISATION, increasing the international cooperation between ecovillages as centres for sustainability education in the field of youth workThis is to be achieved through a networking meeting of 32 youth workers associated with the respective partner organisations. The meeting will take place in Denmark, August 23-28, 2016. The youth workers attending are experts in the field of education for sustainable development and working in ecovillages or bringing the ecovillage concept to other settings. Partly, they are young people with a background in sustainability and keen on working with youth projects. This way, the voice of youth will be represented to bring in young fresh energy. Among the selection criteria is their motivation to start new international collaboration projects.The themes of the meeting can be divided into two main strands:- sharing of best practice- creating new innovative projects & partner findingThe participants will share best practice examples of the youth work in ecovillages they conduct locally in order to inspire the work of each other and promote international innovation transfer. After identifying topics of common interest and brainstorming on ideas for potential future projects, the most promising project ideas are selected. Working groups are formed around these themes who will elaborate a project draft and a project development plan with concrete next action steps.To support the interactive nature of this networking meeting, presentations of the participants are integrated with participative working methods that engage all participants in discussions and collaboration. Methods like World Caf\u00e9 will support the process of brainstorming and identifying objectives and themes for future projects. The working groups are organised in the Open Space style where all participants can invite to a group. Groups can stop or start at any time, they can merge or split and participants are free to change between groups. Only two themes are pre-decided: - A qualified response to the refugee situation, in the field of youth.  - Adaption of the Ecovillage Design Education curriculum to a youth target group. During the follow-up phase after the networking meeting, the working groups continue to implement the project development plan leading to several new funding applications.The output of this project are the future international youth projects initiated, therefore this project has a clear longer term benefit. In the short term, another benefit is the exchange of best practice between the partners, enabling all participants to draw inspiration for their own work at home, thereby qualifying existing and future efforts. The future projects will show the desired impact on the target group of young people, allowing more youth to engage in projects in ecovillages promoting sustainable lifestyles. The project will lead to an increased cooperation and exchange between the partners and possibly other organisations who will get involved in the future projects, including from European countries not represented in this project.It is time that the ecovillage movement take their youth work seriously and this networking meeting is only the first step to spark a new development.

Ecologists, academics, eco-villagers, permaculturists, bio-farmers, and other interested parties will convene next year in Angsbacke in Sweden. There, they will reflect on the network\u2019s achievements, connect with others and share know-how, ideas and experiences. \r\nThese gatherings, like any other where people with a shared vision meet, serve to strengthen participants\u2019 capacity to confront the challenges that face them and in doing so, synergistically strengthen the network as a whole. But often experiences shared are anecdotal, and fail to provide clear evidence of what works well and why. Although we do not suggest that this project represents a rigorous research undertaking, we do acknowledge the importance of introducing an evaluation discipline in order to compare methods and technologies that we think work best. Hence, our focus for this project is to develop, compare and document 3 different agricultural practices at 3 of our member communities, so that we can compare their results and provide recommendations on how they can be implemented across our networks.\r\nThe 4 activities are:\r\n1. Design, develop and implement a regenerative food garden at Arterra Bizimodu ecovillage (6 months)\r\n2. Design, develop and implement a Permaculture food garden at  Valdepielagos ecovillage (6 months)\r\n3. Design, develop and re-cultivate an organic farmland at Los Portales ecovillage (6 months)\r\n4. Collate and compare results and prepare for conference publication and discussion (6 months)\r\nWe recognise that culture and traditions shape our attitudes and approach to doing things and bringing cultures together can be an enriching experience that fosters and energises our collective creativity. For this reason, we would want to assemble cross-cultural teams of volunteers via the partner organisations to collaborate in the realisation of these activities and towards the goal of evaluating how we do things in order to identify the best workable approaches. We see this as an important step in the execution of the network\u2019s strategy and in order to determine the most optimal mix of the number of cultures involved, our approach would be to start with teams diversified enough to spark creative solutions while at the same time compact enough to manage, and then to grow. Hence we decided to cap the number of country organisations involved to those ones mentioned in this application. In conjunction with these sending organisations, we will seek out enthused volunteers who inspire to critically analyse the impact of what we do and to help us implement our ideas effectively.  \r\nGEN-Europe has a rich history and skill set in managing projects. We employ a wide range of methodologies depending on the nature of the project that we are doing, yet all of them have in common the underlying premise that each one of us can realise our own potential if given the chance. This implies articulating a shared dream that we work towards, developing the plans to do so, coordinating the actions we defined in our planning and reflecting and reviewing often on how we have done things. These phases come from the Dragon Dreaming PM methodology, but we also often seek flexibility and rapid responsiveness in the way we work, which we borrow from the scrum meetings concept that is found in the family of Agile PM methodologies. Regardless of the chosen method, our experience tells us that each project participant has something intrinsically valuable to contribute and it is the intuition and good sense of the project coordinator to create the conditions which would enable those contributions to flourish.\r\n\r\nThe work we envisage, in the form of the 4 key activities described here, will be supervised by experienced project coordinators, whose responsibility it will be to allocate the work to team members and track progress. At the same time - and key to our personal development philosophy - our project coordinators will mentor the volunteers, guiding them in defining and realising their own goals within the scope of the overall project.\r\n\r\nWe will also endeavour to celebrate some \u00b4mini-milestones\u00b4, beyond those that can only be quantified, in the form of the personal growth of each of the volunteers that pass through our project.

The training wants to firstly explore the benefits of singing both as a youth tool and methodology. How can we utilise singing for promoting self confidence and developing positive self esteem and other youth work priorities such as teamwork, problem solving and cultural expression. We will then look to explore the power and influence of the \u2018protest song\u2019 and how we can use singing for promoting democratic participation and how, as youth workers, can we encourage the young people we work with to explore and engage as active citizens in the democratic process and find their political voice.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the course are:\r\n- Discover the joy of singing and using their own voice;\r\n- Exploring the power of using the voice to express, thoughts, feelings, emotions and intentions;\r\n- Understand how singing can promote self-development and increase self awareness and confidence;\r\n- Explore how singing can be used to encourage active listening, cooperation and dialogue in our work with young people;\r\n- Identify approaches for dialogue, political change and active citizenship and messages through singing that can enable our youth work.\r\n \r\nThe project will take place in Sermugnano, a small village in central Italy, from the 10th to the 17th December 2018 (travel days included).

The event takes place at Sieben Linden Ecovillage in Northern Germany in November 2017, at the lead partner \u201eFreundeskreis \u00d6kodorf e.V.\u201c headquarters.\r\n\r\nWe have 11 partners from 11 countries: Finland, France, Israel, Italy, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain and UK.\r\n\r\nAll partners work in the field of education for sustainable development. We have two distinct groups of partners:\r\n- ecovillages or ecovillage networks\r\n- youth organisations interested in starting collaborations with ecovillages\r\n\r\nAn ecovillage is an intentional or traditional community that is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes to regenerate social and natural environments. The 4 dimensions of sustainability (ecology, economy, the social and the cultural) are integrated into a holistic approach.\r\n\r\nEcovillages are models of sustainable settlements that serve as training & learning centres where people learn through workshops plus, most importantly, the immersion experience of sharing ecovillage life, which adds a unique feature.\r\n\r\nThe central objective of the project is MAKING THE ECOVILLAGE EXPERIENCE MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR YOUTH, as an inspiring learning environment demonstrating a sustainable lifestyle.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to enable the participants to create quality youth exchange projects in the future.\r\n\r\nThere will be 29 participants in the event in total, including three facilitators from Germany, Slovenia and Spain.\r\nThe target group for the event are youth workers motivated to start youth exchange projects in ecovillages. Some of them are junior youth workers, bringing in the perspective of youth next to the experience of their more senior colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe main activity during the event is the creation of future projects, designing a project draft and a project development plan to be followed after return home.\r\n\r\nDifferent aspects of youth exchange projects are covered to support the development of quality projects.\r\n\r\nThe methods used during the training are diverse. Interactive and participatory methods are combined with input in the form of presentations.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result expected from this project are several youth exchange projects initiated between the present partners and potentially other organisations.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, a strong impact on young people as a target group is expected. This will happen through the youth exchange projects being initiated at the event, directly targeting youth. Ecovillages in all the partner countries will be inspired to offer more activities, both local, national and European, for young people, which will be kick-started during the event. Current activities in the field of youth will equally benefit from the new inspiration and thus potentially improve in quality through the exchange between partners, mutually inspiring each other and creating higher quality in delivery. \r\n\r\nMany more young people than before will be offered the opportunity to participate in a youth exchange hosted in an ecovillage, creating an immersion experience into a sustainable lifestyle that covers all areas of life.", "http://www.ecovillage.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-DE04-KA105-015388_6"], [2016, "Strengthening Youth Participation in Ecovillage Networks", "GLOBAL ECOVILLAGE NETWORK", 14750.0, 5, 6, "This short-term group EVS project enables 10 volunteers from Germany, Italy, Slovakia, Spain and the UK to come to Sweden for 59 days for a unique learning experience on ecovillages as models for ecological, social, economical and cultural sustainability.\r\n\r\nIn July 2017, for the first time since its inception 21 years ago, the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN) European branch will host it\u2018s annual conference in Sweden. The conference promotes the ecovillage model as a pathway to sustainable development supplying the participants with a wealth of information on sustainable living practices regarding ecological, economical, social and cultural sustainability. A large number of around 50-70 community-led sustainable projects from all over Europe are expected to be present at the conference, providing real life examples of sustainable ways of living to the 300-400 participants.\r\n\r\nRELEARN Suderbyn has been an active member of the Global Ecovillage Network, the umbrella organisation of ecovillages, since the foundation of the ecovillage on Gotland. We want to use the opportunity of the conference being hosted in our country to make a unique contribution through the project here presented.\r\n\r\nThe project offers an excellent opportunity to learn more about innovative and sustainable rural development throughout Europe. As well the volunteers will actively contribute to the NextGEN (youth wing of GEN) strand at the conference, created by young people for young people designed to inspire newcomers about the ecovillage concept and create meaningful connections to other young people with similar values.\r\n\r\nThe whole project is set up as a learning experience for the participating volunteers, where the conference, including its preparation phase, provides a learning space where they can experiment with their capacities as youth leaders facilitating sessions and as event organisers, bringing in their own ideas to shape the NextGEN strand, to the extend they are comfortable with as individuals. \r\n\r\nThe volunteers will experience living in a group with all its dynamics and opportunities to develop their social skills, accompanied by experienced mentors.The first half of the project will be hosted on the island of Gotland where the volunteers will get the opportunity to get involved in the largest political event in Sweden, Almedalen week, and to practice to express themselves as active citizens of the European society. They will also experience how an ecovillage, Suderbyn Permaculture Ecovillage, is designed and managed, meeting the local community there. The second half of their stay is in Molkom, V\u00e4rmland close to the \u00c4ngsbacka community experiencing this community-run education centre where the conference itself will take place.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n1. To create an inspiring learning experience for a group of young people living as a community and working on diverse creative tasks to plan and organise a major event.\r\n2. To instill interest in youth for sustainable rural development by creating a focus specifically targeting young people as one feature of the Global Ecovillage Network Conference \r\n\r\nThe volunteers are expected to: \r\n- gain knowledge about ecology and sustainable lifestyles \r\n- organisational skills\r\n- social skills, community-building, conflict resolution methods\r\n- increased confidence in engaging in a group setting\r\n- increased intercultural awareness\r\n- improved English language competence and confidence.", "http://www.ecovillage.org", null, "erasmus_2016-3-SE02-KA105-001645_1"]], "extra": 15}}}}
