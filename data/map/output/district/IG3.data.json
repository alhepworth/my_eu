It is the education which develops global citizenship competencies (knowledge, skills and attitudes). It makes use of participative methodology and experiential learning principles in order to impact its participants on all 3 dimensions. It happens in schools or outside of schools and any person of any age or background can take part. \r\n\r\nTherefore this project was created to answer to a need that was detected in European society (as well as global one).In youth work specific there are not enough educational opportunities for youth workers that can enable them to bring the global dimension to the youth work , to develop the global citizenship competencies of the young people they are working with. This project will offer the opportunity for youth workers and leaders to explore deeper global topics, interdependency and sustainably, as well how to bring these important dimensions in their work, to their beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the project is to build capacity of 6 youth organization to increase the level of global citizenship competencies of young people. \r\n\r\nMore specific objectives are:\r\no To increase the knowledge level of young people in topics like: global interdependencies (from environmental, cultural, economic and political approach), SDGs and post2015 agenda, social and global justice, ICL and global issues, climate change, consumerism and sustainable lifestyle; sustainable development \r\no To stimulate the internalization of global values (as solidarity, global consciences, responsibility, etc.)\r\no To increase the level of sustainable life styles of young people;\r\no To develop sense of common responsibility for the future of their local communities from a global perspective;\r\no To develop competencies for putting in practice \u201cthink global , act local\u201d principle; \r\no To develop practical skills in methods of global education and global citizenship development in their own communities;\r\no To stimulate the participants to act as global education multipliers in their own organization and regions; \r\n\r\nIt will be address to 25  youth workers and coordinators from all Europe (Romania, UK, Bulgaria, Italy, Norway, Hungary,Latvia) that will take part in an intensive educational program which will include 2 training courses (based on non-formal education and methods, with a strong practical approach) in UK in November 2015 and one in Romania (in March 2016) in order to become global education multipliers. In between the trainings the multipliers will have to implement a practice phase which means to deliver global education workshops in their communities. \r\n\r\nBeing a world citizen, understanding our role in an interconnected world, being aware of the responsibilities that this implies and fulfilling them represent an ambitious aim of this project. Approaching issues as human rights, wars, interreligious conflicts, democracy, cultural relativism, etc. from the global perspective will offer a deeper understanding and with a global overview/mind-set it will become more clear what steps are needed in order to bring about changes at local level which will influence at global level and the global agenda (and not only the European one). Among most spread social problems in Europe today are: discrimination, social exclusion, violence, social injustice, human rights violations etc. and this project will logically go deeper in these topics as well.", "http://www.youthwithaglobalvision.org.uk", "YOUTH WITH A GLOBAL VISION", "erasmus_2015-2-UK01-KA105-014088_coordinator"], [2016, "Differences Challenge Assumptions", "YOUTH WITH A GLOBAL VISION", 27510.0, 13, 13, "Often in international projects or the ones including intercultural dialogue, learning or diversity sessions will include one sessions of 1.5 or 3 hours where a simulation or a games will be implemented (from the variety of alternatives mentioned before), with fast debriefing (if at all), which will introduce very fast concept of stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination and taken for granted and not pushed outside of the comfort zone. Not to mention the projects were the intercultural learning is left just for the intercultural nights or the free time of the participants. Of course this is not a constant in the field but rather an observation after years of working in international field. The main need that this project wants to answer to is the lack of advanced intercultural working competencies and sensitivity in youth work field and especially of the ones active and working in international or multicultural settings.  The main goal of this project is to increase the level of intercultural competent, sensitive and quality youth work field.More specific Objectives that will contribute to achieve the main aim:\u2022 To increase/upgrade the knowledge level of youth workers in Intercultural Learning Topics (culture, identity, prejudices, stereotypes, assumptions, relativism,  communication, clashes, intercultural sensitivity);\u2022 To contribute to a deep understanding of the global settings and influence on the cultural awareness and features of young people; \u2022 To develop practical skills in working and managing quality intercultural learning process  in international projects with young people;\u2022 To upgrade skills in managing and facilitating intercultural encounters in youth work (international volunteering, exchanges, local projects in multicultural settings, trainings, etc);\u2022 To develop high intercultural sensitive attitudes in youth work field;\u2022 To empower youth workers to act as responsible intercultural sensitive actors in international field and project ;\u2022 To encourage participation of young people in social processDuring the project the participants will deepen the understanding of how Europe is build today, the roles and responsibilities of European citizens which are strongly connected to multiculturalism and intercultural education, the links between multiculturalism and active citizenship; the beneficiaries will have a more complete understanding of European Citizenship in the context of globalization and will act upon.The training will have duration of 9 working days and will be implemented in Ashburnham (Battle), UK for 28 participants from 13 European Program Countries (UK, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Greece, Croatia, Slovakia, Spain, Germany, Poland, Malta, Czech Republic and Turkey", "http://www.youthwithaglobalvision.org.uk", "YOUTH WITH A GLOBAL VISION", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA105-023483_coordinator"]]}}}}
