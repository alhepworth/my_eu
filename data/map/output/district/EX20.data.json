The job title does not exist in some partner countries and there are no consistent professional community music practices or quality standards across the partnership, although some of the work undertaken by all of the partners can be described as such.Four key ideas run through Musinc programme:Tacking exclusion through inclusion so that people are not \u2018isolated in their need\u2019Developing social/group work skills alongside music skillsUnderstanding of traditional music and its role in community identityThe intellectual outputs of Musinc partnership will ensure a shared understanding of the professional role i.e. description of skills, competencies, knowledge that a \"community musician\" must possess and an open resource centre that demonstrates and instructs best practice in the field of community music that will be applicable across and beyond the partnership. Through it we will develop a shared meaning of the work role and strengthen training paths for potential community musicians.The ORAL TRADITION of which traditional folk music is an integral part is our inspiration for this project. A non-formal pedagogy and learner centred interactive methodology will be employed in both the piloting and testing of the resource materials contained in the virtual resource centre and the delivery of the case study projects. The resulting resource centre will also reflect this by providing an open framework where experienced and emerging practitioners can contribute through a constructivist learning platform. The outputs will be achieved through management meetings, project work in each partner country,  blended teaching and learning activities.The Musinc project will be aimed at improving access to non-formal education by excluded people and promoting social/musical inclusion and so the work practices that are to be shared and examined will concentrate on how to reach and include more of these people.We will work directly with upwards of 700 participants in a variety of excluded settings to provide case study examples. These will include adults with learning disabilities, older people in residential settings, isolated older people, rurally isolated people, mental health service users, and people with different mother tongues.A defining feature of this project is the use of non-formal traditional/national music which strengthens national identity, whilst embedding a pan European musical understanding and cohesion which will assist with working with multi cultural and migrant communities.The project will impact on capacity building within the partnership and individual partners. The working lives of music educators will be changed through additional skills and knowledge gained not least through an international dimension and understanding of their own work practices. There will be outcomes for the end users, individuals in the social contexts and their support organisations both as part of the case study projects, but also in the future through an up skilling of the workforce.Direct delivery of musical activities aimed at alleviating isolation and raising self-esteem as well as providing activities that can contribute to their health and well being.The longer term benefits of such informal music making groups are: SOCIAL NETWORKS: The group allows people who are struggling with their own feelings of self worth to have a level of social interaction which is not dependent on their ability to 'chat'.SOCIAL CAPITAL:  People are in the group often because they want to meet other people and have problems doing so, but regardless of cognitive ability, physical ability, nationality, age or any other differences, can interact through music on an equal basis.RESPECT AND POSITIVE ATTITUDES IN OTHERS: There is no stigma in taking part, people will be there to make music and have fun.The dissemination activities will ensure that the benefits and sustainability of the project go beyond and outlive the partnership.", "http://www.wrenmusic.co.uk", "Wren Music", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA204-024496_coordinator"], [2015, "Tools for e-learning and m-learning", "Wren Music", 3576.0, 2, 2, "The project is to enable two members of staff to attend a course of study to improve our ability as an organisation to offer enhanced learning opportunities through e-learning platforms.\r\n\r\nThe course offers the possibility to acquire new competencies and to use new didactic methods to the educators/ teachers/trainers, by transferring the lessons into an educational environment using \u201ce-learning\u201d based on IT.
