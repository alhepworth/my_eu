Two key aspects of the Strategy: 1) the promotion of a \"sustainable, smart and inclusive\" economic growth; 2) the reduction of early dropout in charge of young people. The overlap between the current economic crisis and the data, that emerge from ISTAT surveys on training poverty of young people, give us a complete inescapable picture: in Italy there are more than 113.000 young people between 14 and 17 years old out of the school\u2013training channels and they represent 5% of the resident population in the same age group; there are more than 2 million young people who do not work and do not study, representing 22% of the population, the incidence is significantly higher than in other European countries; the proportion of NEET is prevalent in the South, where the incidence of the phenomenon reaches 30,9%, although in recent years is also growing in the Central-North, especially the Northeast, where the crisis has intensified the phenomenon of non-employment. Let's Go is coherent with the objectives set by the Europe 2020 Strategy and taken back by the Italian government document \"Italia 2020: piano di azione per l\u2019occupabilit\u00e0 dei giovani attraverso l\u2019integrazione tra apprendimento e lavoro\"; the project would promote the development of techniques skills (compared to the demand of enterprises) through the creation of an internship period, carried out during the course of the studies - as advocated by the Italian document - to develop the culture of work and enterprise, of language skills and citizenship skills and entrepreneurial spirit. Let's Go promotes 300 mobilities for the realization of internship in enterprises, pointed towards young people of the circuit of Education and Vocational Training. These young people come from the network CONFAP (National Entities for Vocational Training) and Professional Technical Institutes of the Province of Padua. The beneficiaries are: - the second and third annual paths of regional qualification (in some cases fourth annual path where required under regional regulation); - neo-qualified of qualification paths of not more than one year; - young of the4th and 5th class of technical professional institutes; - the graduates of not more than one year from the education pathways and technical professional. The young beneficiaries come from 17 Italian regions (from North to South Italy). Let's Go is a \"multi- sectorial\" project because it involves young people from different professional backgrounds (33% catering, 20 % mechanical, 17% agro-alimentary transformation, 7% of electricity, 10% of thermo-plumbing, 10 % well-being, 3% graphics). The correspondence between the type of beneficiaries, professional profiles and countries of destination is designed on the specific professional sectors in relation to the offer of the labour market of the European territorial contexts involved. The profiles of mechanics, electricity, thermo-plumbing will go in Germany, UK, Spain and Sweden. The profiles of the catering will travel to France, Germany, Spain and Malta. The profiles of agro-alimentary transformation will go to Spain. The profiles of well-being will travel to UK. The graphic profiles will go to Germany. The pedagogical approach of the project is intercultural because the internship activities foreseen are designed in function, on the one hand, of the reinforcement of learning already established by the beneficiary in Italy (strengthening of the starting situation), from another hand, in function of the learning to be acquired in the country of destination (differences-comparative learning; product/typical processes of the country of destination, the various laws of hygiene and safety in the workplace; different measurement techniques; different types of raw materials used for processing).

The partners are from five different countries. There are two partners in two of the countries involved because we want to optimize and enhance the opportunities that each of them offers in terms of placing young people in companies.This project will include four different kinds of training programs. The first one is aimed at vocational school graduate students completing their vocational courses; the other one is for students who are attending the second year of their vocational courses; another program is available for young graduates who have completed their courses; finally, it is also expected to carry out internships in companies and schools, involving teachers, technicians and managers of the entities that are part of the Consortium.In what regards the different mobilities, the linguistic and cultural preparation will occur before, during and after the mobilities, through face-to-face training in a classroom context and using the OLS platform.The traineeships with the duration of 6 and 10 weeks are part of the courses\u2019 curriculum and will enable these students to carry out their training in a real context of work in an European country where they can perform experiments in different contexts.The 10 months\u2019 traineeships are avalilable to graduate students, in order to create new opportunities to these young people, making their integration into the labour market easier. These trainships will shorten the effects caused by youth unemployment - a serious social problem in Portugal and in the European Union.Developing these traineeships and simultaneously implementing an individual technical project, is a way to contribute to the implementation of two challenges that are essential to fulfill the students\u2019 plan of studies.We would like to highlight that the beneficiaries of this project live and study in a disadvantaged rural region in the interior of Portugal where an infrastructure and development deficit is clear.The traineeships will occur in different phases, with different flows, starting at different times; they will be held in each of the school years, from the beginning of the 2nd school quarter (end of January) until the end of July.This mobility project is aimed at 87 young people and 12 teachers/technicians from a school population of 1865 students who attend all schools which are part of the Consortium.

The best way to transfer such skills is through the use of experiences that encourage the learning by doing approach. Among these, a crucial role is played by learning experiences based on the Project-based Learning (PBL)  methodology and by the participation in transnational traineeships. Through PBL, which is a teaching method that organizes learning around projects, students gain knowledge and skills by investigating complex and real issues, carrying out tasks and developing project products. The transnational experiences carried out outside the friendly environment encourage the development of transversal skills such as adaptability and flexibility that are part of the skills required to develop an entrepreneurial attitude. Since several years, the members of the national consortium (ENAC, SCF, ENGIM VENETO) are trying to apply PBL methodologies within their centers, and they have recently decided to promote a joint project, based on this methodology, aiming at creating a network among several IVET centers by establishing a buyer-supplier relationship. In this way the centers engaged in the network will create products / services to be used by other network centers.\r\nThe mobility project EU gives you WINGS would like to interact with this joint project in order to combine the development of PBL methodologies and transnational mobility experiences addressed to VET students and staff. The specific objective of the project EU gives you wings are: a) to strength the competences of VET staff engaged in planning and managing learning processes using the PBL approach and through the exchange of good practices with other VET providers; b) to strength technical/professional and linguistic skills of VET students, as well as  improve their transversal skills through transnational placements carried out in a different economic and social context. This will allow VET students to develop innovation, creativity and responsibility that in the short term will support them in the planning and implementation of projects using the PBL approach and in the long run will increase their employability. \r\nTo achieve these objectives, the project promotes three types of mobility activities: 1)traineeship for IVET students in a company abroad for a period of three / four weeks; 2) traineeship for IVET students in a VET center abroad - with learning periods in companies or other organisations - for a period of two weeks; 3) job shadowing activities for staff members in other VET centers throughout Europe. The first two types of mobility activities will involve 210 students (in IVET pathways, 2^-3^-4^ year or within one year of obtaining their graduation), the third is addressed to 35 VET staff members. The project provides a wide sectorial and geographical coverage and will involve students, providers and partners from different economic sectors. The students involved in the project have different professional background: catering (15%), food processing (14%), administrative (25%), graphic (17%), well-being (23%), fashion (6%). In addition, the partnership have a significant geographical dimension both at national level (13 Italian regions) and European level (24 partners from 13 countries). The large number of foreign partners and the criteria used to select these institutions will assure VET students that the mobility experience is suited to their professional profiles and will provide VET staff with an extensive knowledge of PBL methodologies developed in the EU. The project envisages the use of ECVET tools in order to allow the exploitation and recognition of the learning outcomes acquired during the transnational mobility. To this end, the consortium will take advante of the experience of SCF and will use the ECVET tools developed by SCF during GORES and LET's GO projects.\r\nThe main results of the project will be a) a manual with the PBL methodologies and best practices seen by the staff during the job shadowing experiences; b) the creation of video/ multimedia materials concerning students\u2019experiences. \r\nThe project will have an impact on the development of professional and transversal skills of VET students and staff involved, as well as on the improvement of VET  training provision which will be possible thanks to the improvement in the use of the PBL approach and by strengthening the mutual trust among project partners.

These institutes, in fact, have in common the intent to engage students in a transnational mobility project, also recognized for purposes of work-related learning which will help to acquire and consolidate specific skills in the field of educational childcare services and promote their employability by providing an effective response to the demand that, in recent years, has shown a trend of gradual growth and whose supply is inadequate throughout the Country.\r\nEurope, in fact, indicates to the member countries two significant goals to be pursued: the growth of our economic system through the enhancement of women workers and the services for early childhood, accessible to 33% of children from 0 to 3 years old.\r\nItaly is far away from reaching both these goals. In the EU as mentioned in Bulletin 2015 by Eurydice - \"Early Childhood Education and Care\", only 30% of children under 3 years old, is attending a ECEC structure (Early Childhood Education and Care). The demand is conditioned not only by the quality and cost of the service, but also by social and labor policies. Only in a few European countries every child are entitled to attend ECEC and the demand and supply of the service is balanced. In Italy, not only there is no right to ECEC, but the demand is much greater than supply. In recent years, however, policies to support the family have been implemented, firstly with the babysitter and kindergarten bonuses and lately with the kindergarten bonus in 2017, entered in the Budget Law as an economic contribution to families who enroll their children in kindergarten.\r\nIn this context was born this project that covers the territory of Puglia and Basilicata regions, as both have significant experience in services for young children and intend to continue in this direction, encouraging the exchange of experiences, good practices and raising the quality level of experience in mobility.\r\nPuglia Region in recent years stood out for its remarkable commitment to policies aimed at early childhood, setting a very ambitious goal, \"to increase the personal care services, easing the family responsibilities to raise the participation of women in the labor market\", with a systematic intervention aimed, on the one hand to strengthen the socio-educational infrastructure (80 kindergartens and 2,480 available jobs in 2005 - 497 structures and 11,586 existing jobs) and on the other to support the offer for families, through the issuance of a notice in order to benefit of Service vouchers for work-family conciliation, to be spent in childcare services, implemented with additional funds for 2016-2017.\r\nIn Basilicata, the percentage of municipalities that have activated services for children, stood at 32.1%, in line with the average of the South (32.8%), but significantly less than that of Italy (55, 1%). The region registered a strong growth of female unemployment rate, due also in part to the lack of educational services for early childhood. Therefore, it\u2019s important to invest in innovative and flexible services (eg. Tagesmutter), appropriate solutions for the small municipalities of the Region and an alternative for the bigger Puglia cities which often have unanswered demands. Last year, the Regional Council of Basilicata set up the \"Tagesmutter\" service and the Board approved the professional profile, inserting it in the regulated qualifications framework.\r\nThe project aims at the consolidation and the acquisition of skills related to the professional profile of Educators for early childhood, which carries out educational programs and care of children in the 0-3 years. Employment opportunities, which are enhanced by the implementation of this project, are represented by the inclusion in different types of public or private institutions aimed at early childhood.

Italian researches indicate that the problem is connected to the inadequacy of the educational system, not always able to provide the appropriate tools to support the employment of school leavers. As a matter of fact there is a significant mismatch between the professional requirements and the level of skills achieved by young people during their school education.\r\nIn the light of this a Consortium has been created, composed of six high schools, a group of local trade associations and municipalities of the Provinces of Treviso and Pordenone in the North-East of Italy. The Consortium has designed the project \u201cI MOVE\u201d with the main objective of matching the educational school syllabuses with the professional needs requested by the business world, as well as offering young students new tools and ways to increase their knowledge and professional skills.\r\nThese goals will be achieved through the development of on the spot training for 120 students (20 for each school) who will be placed in enterprises located in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Malta, operating in the following sectors: economy, marketing, trading, mechanics, electronics, mechatronics, social services and tourism.\r\nDuring the four week training, the young participants will develop soft skills such as capacity of initiative, decision-making, adaptability, responsibility and autonomy that will support their personal and professional growth. Thus the participants will be qualified to deal with the labour market, experiencing new working environments and production methods, so as to match the professional expectations of the present business world.\r\nThe project will also enhance the cultural and linguistic background of the students, providing a multicultural and multi-linguistic working environment, and sharing values with people from different countries. This training path will allow the young participants to develop an open-minded and positive attitude towards the changes that occur in the international labour market.\r\nThrough the project \u201cI MOVE\u201d the schools of the Consortium will have a solid opportunity to build a European network between employees and enterprises, therefore establishing professional relationships. The schools and their staff will achieve an implementation of new educational paths for the professional and human growth of their students.\r\nFurthermore the project will have a positive impact on the local trade associations, allowing them to build a productive dialogue with schools in orienting educational careers towards the needs and expectations of the business companies, matching knowledge and skills required by the labour market. The local enterprises will be able to employ qualified and dynamic professional resources with an international profile.\r\nFinally the municipalities will strengthen relationships with local schools and companies, reaching the goal to promote and enhance the wellbeing and the quality of life in their community.

The school conducts Higher Vocational Education in Travel & Tourism and Hospitality, Accounting and Finance, Health and Welfare, Retail, and IT. The number of students at the school is just over 700, there are 22 permanently employed staff, and 60 to 80 contracted staff working with education. The project is linked to the EU\u2019s educational policy goals; at least 40% of all 30-34 year-olds should have completed tertiary education. The project is timely with regard to EU goals \u2013 Higher Vocational Education in Sweden has never before been allocated so many places. The political direction is clear \u2013 there is a strong commitment to HVE. \r\n \r\nThe aim of the project for staff is to obtain more knowledge about EU tools, and to gain better insight into the overall goals set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy for Higher Education. Knowledge is needed about SeQF, EQF and how ECVET can be implemented concerning credit transfer. Staff will gain knowledge by learning how tasks are performed, taught and assessed in Europe within the professional roles that students are educated for at Frans Schartau. Further aims of the project are to see how the European dimension can be reflected in the curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the project for students is to provide them with international professional experience, and increased language skills as requested by the labour market. One consequence of mobility is that employability increases while strengthening the student\u2019s ability to work in an international labour market. Through exchange, students get the opportunity to acquire key competencies such as communicating in another language, learning new technologies that increase digital skills. Living in another country leads to the development of social, personal and cultural skills, and by participating in exchange projects a person\u2019s capacity to take initiative is stimulated. \r\n \r\nThree members of staff with experience of international cooperation will organise the project. Well-established activities and methods have been planned for some time. After starting up the project and implementation with staff and students, work will progress according to the Activity Plan that also includes theme days, help with writing CVs, and that each participant prepares themself by examining specific areas in the recipient country. \r\n\r\nFive different professional areas of work at the school will be represented among the 14 employees participating in mobility to obtain a comprehensive result. Staff should be in the position to immediately apply their new skills to benefit students and promote work on internationalization at the school. The 25 students participating each year will be selected to achieve a good spread across the various areas of work. Students must have a good communicative ability to be able to pass on what they have learnt after their Work Placements. After selection, mobility goals will be anchored with the host organization or company and the Learning Agreement written.\r\n\r\nThe intended outcome is that the school should be at the forefront of internationalization work. There will be more knowledge within the organization about professional roles seen from a European perspective. The knowledge acquired will give courses and teaching at the school an international dimension, increase knowledge of SeQF, EQF and ECVET as well as ensuring that international Work Placements maintains high quality.\r\n\r\nThe school is part of the City of Stockholm, which organizes education at all levels so that circulation of results will be via the City's Intranet and in the newsletter.

We want to make them realize that a united Europe and a good cooperation between the member states are crucial for a stable economic Europe.  Especially in view of countries leaving the European union and the rise of the populist parties.\r\nWe aim at offering challenging education in general, not only by creating an international programme of Excellence for our VET+ students of level 4EQF but also for developing the talents of our students of level 2 EQF, with a socially challenged background by offering them a placement abroad. \r\n\r\nOur continuous goal is to maintain the high standard of QUALITY OF PLACEMENTS abroad by using solid and renomated training companies,  by consulting the Dutch recognition organisation SBB, the intermediate organisations in the host country and by using the network of our educational partners abroad . This is safeguarded by agreements with companies in the context of EQF and the new Qualification files of the Dutch government and by usung Learning Agreements, ECVET,  MOU, Europass and other instruments for agreements on content, monitoring, validation, recognition and evaluation of the experiences abroad.

In response to these sociological difficulties, the Lyc\u00e9e opened the first Professional Micro Lyc\u00e9e in France in September 2013 to accommodate young people who have dropped out of the school system.\r\nOne of our main aims is to create an awareness of European opportunities through work placements in Europe. These ambitious projects increase our young peoples\u2019 self-esteem.  Although the approach is initially timid and incredulous, these projects are strongly supported by the students and their families.  The best proof of our success is during enrolment, when students tell us that a neighbour or a friend told them about their experience in a European country.  Whether it is through the Leonardo Da Vinci or Comenius programme, or through a school trip, these young people have been able to leave their region, generally for the first time, to go to Great Britain, Spain or Poland for work placements within companies or to almost any of the other European countries through the Comenius projects.\r\nOur Erasmus+ 2014 project concerns 25 Lyc\u00e9e students which corresponds to the average number of accepted applications which we are in a position to deal with each school year.\r\nOur European partners are constantly developing, according to the contacts and networks of the team in charge of the European activity.

The standard model of cosmology assumes GR as a theory to describe gravity on all scales. In 1998, astronomers made a surprising discovery that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, not slowing down. This late-time acceleration of the Universe has become the most challenging problem in theoretical physics. Within the framework of GR, the acceleration would originate from an unknown \u201cdark energy.\u201d Alternatively, it could be that there is no dark energy and GR itself is in error on cosmological scales. The standard model of cosmology is based on a huge extrapolation of our limited knowledge of gravity. This discovery of the late time acceleration of the Universe may require us to revise the theory of gravity and the standard model of cosmology based on GR. \n\nThe main objective of my project is to develop cosmological tests of gravity and seek solutions to the origin of the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe by challenging conventional GR. Upcoming surveys will make cosmological tests of gravity a reality in the next five years. There are remaining issues in developing theoretical frameworks for probing gravitational physics on cosmological scales. We construct modified gravity theories as an alternative to dark energy and analyse \u201cscreening mechanisms\u201d to restore GR on scales where it is well tested.

At present, there is no physically motivated model to explain this, directly demonstrating that current theories of fundamental particles and gravity are either incorrect or incomplete. Understanding this phenomenon is consequently one of the most important outstanding problems in the whole of science. Perhaps the simplest solution is to postulate a new component of energy density with an effective negative pressure that forms 75\\% of the present energy density of the Universe. There are many other theoretical ideas for explaining this phenomenon, which are often collectively referred to as ``dark energy'. The research in this proposal is designed to help to understand dark energy by setting constraints on the cosmological expansion. The spatial distribution of matter and its evolution are sensitive probes of the matter/energy content of the Universe. Consequently galaxy surveys, which trace this distribution, provide key avenues for understanding dark energy through a number of different techniques. One technique, which is the focus of the research proposed here, uses ``Baryon Acoustic Oscillations' to constrain dark energy. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations are patterns of galaxies, initiated by sound waves in the early Universe, that form a fixed scale in the Universe whose true size we know. The apparent scale of these ``standard rulers', when observed in galaxy surveys, constrains the distance--redshift relation and consequently how dark energy is driving the acceleration of the Universe.

Secondly, a reliable long-term framework will be developed for which additional data needs will be specified in order to fill current information gaps to achieve reliable long-term management requirements.

However, our understanding of the stresses imparted by fluids in the shallow crust (2 km) and how these over-pressurize the surrounding rock via the process of hydrofracture is not yet fully understood, especially in anisotropic rocks. In recent years, this topic has been the subject of much scientific interest in the light of the new opportunities surrounding the production of natural gas via shale reservoirs that must necessarily be fractured in order to release the gas in a controversial process known as \u2018fracking\u2019. This process has attracted considerable attention from the media, policy makers and the engineering community due to the challenges it poses.\n\nThe scenario above is further complicated by the fact that shale rock layers are anisotropic in nature, both in strength and in terms of material physical properties,  making any assessment of how and where fracture propagate difficult. In addition, the use of active pore fluids (via temperature or acidity level) adds yet another factor to the process, especially from an engineering perspective.

The current treatment is oral rehydration therapy combined with antibiotics. However, with antibiotic resistance on the rise, new antimicrobial strategies are needed to combat the disease. An attractive antimicrobial approach is to inhibit functions that are essential for bacterial virulence. This disarms the bacteria rather than killing them, reducing the selective pressure that leads to antibiotic resistance in the first place. Four small regulatory RNAs, the quorum regulatory RNAs (Qrrs), lie at the heart of the virulence pathway in V. cholerae. At low bacterial cell density, in the initial phases of infection, the Qrrs are abundant which leads to the expression of virulence genes, infection of the host and cholera. Post infection, when the cells are at high densities, Qrrs are no longer produced, which turns off virulence-gene expression and induces the release of the bacteria back into the environment for reinfection. The Qrrs function by altering the translation and/or stability of specific mRNA targets through base-pairing, which ultimately regulates the expression of the virulence genes. Artificially modulating these base-pairing interactions is key to inhibiting V. cholerae virulence. In order to do this, it is necessary to elucidate the molecular details of the interactions. How do the Qrrs bind to their mRNA-targets? Are protein partners, e.g. Hfq, required for the interaction? What are the binding parameters of the interactions?
