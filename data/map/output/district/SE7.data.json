This has been ongoing over the past 10-15 years, at a time of major European innovations in player development and coaching delivery. This ignorance of advanced European methodology has hindered skills acquisition among our young apprentice players, relative to European player development on an age-matched basis.\r\n\r\nThis project has a two-fold approach. Firstly, it will allow a group of 20 Charlton Athletic FC apprentices (aged from 16 to 19 years of age) to gain experience of the training methods at top performing Spanish football clubs. Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the professional ranks of UK clubs are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European exposure will improve employability in secondary careers.  Secondly, we seek to improve our core staff training across a range of disciplines including coaching, sports science, physiotherapy and administration by introducing them to the forward thinking ways of a variety of top performing football clubs. 30 staff will be split into 6 groups of 5 participants who will be hosted by football clubs in countries including Spain, Portugal, Belgium and The Netherlands to ensure a broad perspective is seen and the best practices can be adopted. This in turn will enhance our club performance through forward thinking techniques and practices being developed, and will also serve to enhance our \u2018One Team\u2019 approach is a core foundation for the success of Charlton Athletic.\r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives:\r\n1. Improved physiological development of apprentice participants through the implementation of innovative training schedules as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility.\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy apprentices and players in Europe\r\n3. Skills and technology transfer between Charlton Athletic mobility staff and European club football staff.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for all participants.\r\n5. Heightened awareness of cultural diversity within another European country for all participants.\r\n6. Increased maturity and sense of initiative for mobility apprentices.\r\n7. Increased self-empowerment and self-esteem for all participants.\r\n8. Enhanced cultural awareness for all participants.\r\n9. More active participation in work and social activities\r\nOur host partners were chosen on the basis of them being amongst the top performing football clubs in the world and can demonstrate clear evidence of a mobility support structure for prospective participants. The duration of the mobility has been set at two weeks for apprentices and five days for VET staff following discussions with coaching staff at the Charlton Athletic FC Academy and our Austrian partner. \r\n\r\nMobility participants will be apprentices employed by Charlton Athletic FC under the Apprenticeship in Sporting  Excellence (ASE) framework which is a work based learning programme combining training and playing  experiences with study for academic qualifications. \r\n\r\nCharlton Athletic FC will publicise the project through local and national media, to include television, radio and national and local newspapers. This will be complemented by our European partners, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility. Friendly matches played by the apprentice participants against host opposition will be publicised in the host region and attendance by local spectators actively encouraged.\r\n\r\nKey project objectives involve the enhanced acquisition of key coaching innovations which will result in improved player and staff performance and enhanced skills levels for the participant during mobility. The ultimate evaluation of success will be an increase in employability and productivity of all participants, and with apprentices achieving success as a professional footballer or gaining employment in a secondary career pathway.
