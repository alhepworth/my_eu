The existing situation is characterized by a fragmented structure as regards technology, procedures, methods and organization on national level as well as EU-level.\nThe project will be based on the development of a new toolbox focusing on 1) identification, organization and establishment of knowledge of critical elements in the event structure thorough studies of a wide selection of scenarios, real incidents and exercises and 2) analysis and identification of gaps in the current response situation and organization and integration of the allocated response capabilities or functions in a toolbox of equipment, procedures and methods and 3) an allocated system or kit for public information, decision-support, first-responder training and exercises.\nThese response capabilities functions are to a great extent universal in character and independent of national organizational structures. The concept and developed system will therefore provide EU and member states with a flexible and integrated system for coordinated response to CBRN terrorist attack, which is easier to adapt to various national organizations and regulations.\nParticular attention will be given to integration and understanding of human factors and societal aspects in all the parts of the project.

Successful CBRNE resilience requires a global System-of-Systems approach. The EDEN project will leverage the added-value of tools and systems from previous R&D efforts and improve CBRNE resilience through their adaptation and integration. The concept of the EDEN project is to provide a \u201ctoolbox of toolboxes\u201d EDEN Store to give stakeholders access to interoperable capabilities they deem important, or affordable, from a certified set of applications. It will share the burden of development and allows for lessons to be learned and applications to be enhanced. The benefit of the EDEN concept is that integration will be applied at the application level.  This means that all countries and stakeholders, irrespective of their existing capability levels, will gain immediate advantages through improved interoperability.  EDEN Store will allow capabilities to be shared among multi-national CBRNE stakeholders, which is paramount in cross-border incident management, and through time allow for a build up of common capability across European boundaries. EDEN will be validated by three themed end-user demonstrations (Food Industry, Multi Chemical, Radiological) covering multiple hazards (CBRNE), phases of the security cycle, response tiers, and stakeholders. The EDEN consortium includes CBRNE domain end-users, major stakeholders, large system integration and solution providers, including SMEs with innovative solutions, and RTOs.
