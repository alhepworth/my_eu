The beneficiaries will investigate tools of scheduling day structure, differentiation and inclusion as well as strategies of cooperation between professions at school. A short induction course at South Devon College carried out by British students and their teachers will provide the theoretical basis and will result in an additional certificate of participation.

Aircraft data networks have increased dramatically in complexity throughout the history of powered flight. Modern networks must support many nodes with a wide range of span lengths, bandwidths and protocols. Existing systems, chiefly based on copper conductors, have evolved to support these ever-increasing demands.

The current screening and basic diagnostics for the disease involve intra-ocular pressure measurement, visual field tests and detection of structural damage to the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibre layer. The present methods have high rates of false positive or false negative results since the in depth analysis of optical nerve head damage is not possible due to the poor resolution of available optical technologies.

The key breakthrough elements are: (i) A revolutionary low cost multiband supercontinuum light source. (ii.) Ground-breaking ultra-broadband photonic components required to exploit such a source.

The careful management of air flow within a building forms part of this strategy through the control of inlet fresh air and exhaust air, maximising air re-circulation, and minimising the amount of fresh air which is often drawn in through a heat exchanger. However, there is a high risk that the air quality is reduced. Continued exposure to environments with poor air quality is a major public health concern in developed and developing countries. It is estimated that the pollutants responsible for poor air quality cause nearly 2.5 million premature deaths per year world-wide. Significantly, around 1.5 million of these deaths are due to polluted indoor air, and it is suggested that poor indoor air quality may pose a significant health risk to more than half of the world\u2019s population. Perhaps surprisingly, remedial action to improve air quality is often easy to implement. Relatively simple measures such as increased air flow through ventilation systems, or a greater proportion of fresh air to re-circulating air are sufficient to improve air quality. Low-energy air purification and detoxification technologies are available which will reduce the concentration of specific pollutants. Similarly, filtration systems (e.g. electrostatic filters) can be switched in to reduce the level of the particulate matter in the air (the principle pollutant responsible for poor health). The INTASENSE concept is to integrate a number of micro- and nano-sensing technologies onto a common detection platform with shared air-handling and pre-conditioning infrastructure to produce a low-cost miniaturised system that can comprehensively measure air quality, and identify the nature and form of pollutants.

We aim at the subject of English serving as a basis for other subjects with regard to CLIL in e.g. science and music so that our school can achieve an enrichment in these types of classes and, what is more, also an improved  European profile apart from the already existing CLIL classes in History, Geography and CLIL modules in Ethics/Philosphy.

The beneficiaries will investigate tools of scheduling day structure, differentiation and inclusion as well as strategies of cooperation between professions at school. A short induction course at South Devon College carried out by British students and their teachers will provide the theoretical basis and will result in an additional certificate of participation. Acquired methods of good practice will be applied in an educational activity planned and carried out by participants. The project responds to claims of politics and research for trained childcare practitioners who are trained especially in the field of full day schooling and the pressure for innovation within that new field of work. In accordance with the lately introduced personal budget for people with special needs in Germany future special needs practitioners investigate their forthcoming revised role looking for ways to continue to develop in their role. On placement in various British organisations of special needs care and education they will test the successfully applied concept of Person Centred Planning (PCP) in how far the degree of self-determination of clients can be increased and which measures have to be concluded for their work in Germany.Young people in initial vocational training will develop professional identity in fields of work which are determined by significant changes and increased demands. They will take part in innovation and will increase their prospects on the job market. They will acquire necessary competences to work at bilingual organisations or with people who have migrated to Germany or to foster participation of people with special needs in settings of inclusion.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002924_8"]]}}}}
