We aim to send a mix of six teachers and teaching assistants on  8 day  courses in France to improve confidence in speaking French and delivering French lessons as well as cross curricular lessons in geography, art, PE and global citizenship. The project will be a 2 year project with the staff being sent in waves to enable us to embed and build upon the language and culture into our school. The course we have found has a mix of language teaching, experiences of the culture and french activities, and an opportunity to forge links with a french school, in order to bring these experiences back to school and share with other staff and children. We aim to use these experiences to feed into long term plans and the school development plan to enable us to be ready for the changes in the new curriculum. We see this project as an on going project which we will be continually building on to improve our language teaching within the school, and sharing resources and ideas, building up a good support network. we envisage our pupils receiving a rounded education which will include their intercultural understanding and tolerance as well as getting them ready for more formal testing when they move on to high school, as well as heightening their aspirations and broadening their horizons.

We want to develop strategies for language teaching that embrace our \u2018challenge curriculum\u2019 principles, increase understanding of other cultures and embed the idea of global citizenship. We also want to look at sporting connections between our communities and use this as a way of engaging all learners. We want to close gap in attainment and prepare children better to go on to high school to study MFL. \r\n\r\nImproving the attainment of young people with low basic skills in Maths, Science and Literacy is the core objective for Flowery Field School.

By using a pedagogy which celebrates different learning strategies, children will develop an awareness of how they learn a new language and will be able to become more literate in recognising and flexing their learning muscles. We are also interested in looking at the use of Makaton when teaching Spanish and improving transition between KS2 and KS3.  We want to promote the inclusion and celebration of EAL / bilingual children and enhance the Social, Moral, Spiritual and Cultural objectives of the school by broadening intercultural understanding and ensuring that there is an international dimension to learning.\r\n\r\nWe will take a whole school approach to this project and will work together to achieve our aims. We would like to develop a two-year project, resulting in improvements in the teaching and learning of languages and embedding of the international dimension across the school. We want every aspect of our school life to contribute towards our ethos of celebrating language learning and cultural diversity.\r\n\r\nAs part of this project, we would like to involve a large number of our staff in mobility activities to Spain.
