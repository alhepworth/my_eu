Hordaland is a region in growth, having reached half a million inhabitants it is now one of the fastest growing counties in Norway. \r\n\r\nRelevant skills and competences are becoming increasingly important, and the labour market and businesses call for more well-performing educational and training systems. In order to meet these needs, and ensure the competitiveness of the region, Hordaland will continually have to acquire new knowledge and methods.

The programme will be an important contribution in meeting both the challenge of restructuring, as well as creating closer cooperation between education and training and the labour market. Further, the programme will be important in improving language and intercultural competences.\r\n\r\nHCC continuously aims at increasing participation among our partners. In this application, we have maintained approximately the same number of VET pupils as previous years, but have had an increase in participation among our Apprenticeship Training Offices/Establishments.  \r\n\r\nBy including participation in the Erasmus+ programme as a tool in the Competence Development Plan 2016-20 (CDP), we aim to strengthen professional skills and intercultural competences among VET teachers. Including job shadowing abroad into the CDP, contributes to the quality of the projects as well as long-term competence development. We also make an effort to include staff mobility to the mobilities for apprentices. Allowing mentors to take part in work placements together with their apprentice will not only improve the quality of training, but also increase the impact of the mobility. \r\n\r\nThis project emphasise developing cross-sectoral group mobilities. Sustainable development demands international cooperation across different sectors, governmental levels, and disciplines. Close links between businesses and education is of great importance in developing competences and networks, promoting innovation, adapting to the green shift, and securing that education reflects the needs in the market. Mobilising the inter-municipality councils of Hordaland has been a priority in this application, as they are central players when it comes to facilitating cooperation between municipalities, commerce and education. One example of a project involving these councils is the project exchanging best practice with the wool industry in Shetlands, coordinated by Region Nordhordland. The project involves several key local stakeholders within the wool industry, VET, and municipalities of the region.\r\n\r\nThe mobility projects in this application involve systematic work to ensure the quality of preparation and implementation.

In order to continue developing our vocational programs, students and staff, we need to take another step and it is against internationalization. The retail and IT industry includes many international relations and English as professional language. Students will have the whole of Europe as a labor market, so it is important to study the working environment, culture and customs during there education so that they can work more easily in other countries and to gain a better understanding of cultural differences and how English is used as a technical language.

Participants also get to know and learn new professional skills based on an internationalization perspective in their future profession and in their present professional profession. This enables the students to achieve a deeper goal achievement and understanding described in the rules for Gy11 and approaching the diploma objectives for vocational education and training, and the teachers develop their teaching, which creates higher quality in the students' vocational education. Assessing competense based learning and the silent knowledge of a profession results in the best quality at a visual meeting and therefore we want to create the conditions for our vocational teachers to conduct tripartite conversations in place or through digital technology.\r\n\r\nEfficiency\r\nFinding partner organizations, applying and creating procedures and processes to enable VET abroad is resource-intensive. By centralizing resources in a consortium, the schools in the consortium will be able to send their students abroad to do parts of their VET and teachers for job shadowing. Each school can then develop at its own pace with a few students where they can work on internationalization and continue work on developing local routines and processes with the support of centrally developed materials and key persons. Using period placement schedule as a resource allows the flow of students to be evenly distributed over the academic year and receiving partners can maintain a good quality over time and our organization can handle the amount of students who then continuously can send smaller number of students and increase the number over time.\r\n\r\nInnovation\r\nIn the IT- and retail industry, new technologies are being developed both nationally and internationally.

International competences offer VET learners the opportunity to develop their abilities to actively participate in an increasing multicultural society and global world. To achieve these goals, it is an important task of the HCC to mobilise VET schools and training agencies to participate in European mobility programmes.

The wine press chooses qualitative education that starts from the possibilities and talents of the pupils. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, we have ensured that program development has resulted in a strong expansion of project activities, workplace learning, internships and opportunities for connection with the labor market. \r\nThe intention is to let our students graduate successfully, limit the school drop-out as much as possible and offer them maximum opportunities in their future career. \r\n\r\nThe establishment of the seventh specialization years (vocational secondary school) and the Se-n-Se years of agro and green management and graphic design (seventh years after technical and art secondary education) fit into this framework. \r\nThe Dual Learning pilot project \"school desk in the workplace\" that started this school year in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and Syntra Flanders is an example of how we want to support young people in optimizing their future possibilities. \r\n\r\nThe Wijnpers wants to profile itself more internationally oriented, multicultural and open-minded from recent policy choices and to further develop the internal school working effect from these objectives. \r\nAs a strategic objective, we first propose that all pupils receive at least two international experiences in their study career and succeed in using functionally foreign languages. It is an ambitious goal since the school population of De Wijnpers counts a lot of socially vulnerable pupils and pupils with learning disabilities. \r\n\r\nThe school started in September 2015 with a CLIL program, language exchange and has a long tradition of multi-day study trips to European cultural capitals and project weeks abroad. Over the past 3 school years, our Se-n-Se pupils in Poland, Spain, Great Britain, France and Italy have completed successful traineeships thanks to Erasmus +, and this has had an enormous impact on the further development of our internationalization working group within our school. .\r\n\r\nThis project proposal is situated on three levels that tie in with the major objectives of the school vision:\r\n- a long internship of 13 weeks in Spain, Poland or Great Britain for students of the seventh year Se-n-Se (which is preceded by intensive training in the first semester)\r\n- a short group internship of 2 weeks in Spain or Great Britain for the pupils of Dual Learning and Se-n-Se\r\n- and finally the supervision and preparation of the internships by the teachers involved.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the internship abroad is to provide pupils with a total experience and motivate them for further education in higher education, or to prepare them better for the labor market. We want the pupil to make the choice to participate in this project, so that we can give motivated youngsters who are bursting with talent the chance to grow across borders on their way to European maturity. It is expected that the project and the immersion in a different culture, with different habits, will lead to a significant increase in motivation, practical language skills, the learning and working qualities and choice skills of the young adults. We hope that this will significantly increase their chances in the further study or work career.\r\nThe other culture and way of working means that their talents can further explore a European unity and maturity. The basis of the acquired knowledge and skills that they gain from this experience will be able to develop further as a seed, and also give them enormous added value within their own personal and social growth.\r\nThe support for the pupil in their foreign internship by the teachers must provide a multiplier effect both in terms of professional competence and the effect on internationalization within the school team. For the school and the foreign partners, this project will function as a learning network in which knowledge, contacts and experience are exchanged. In the future, after a positive evaluation and adjustment from the quality assurance cycle, this added value can be further expanded and lead to more intensive partnerships and new projects.\r\nWith this project we hope to be able to motivate others to share this international message together, and thereby to form an ever expanding network, where learning, integration, implementation of new ideas and cooperation are central, and where qualities are transcended across borders. be shared.", "http://www.adccollege.eu", null, "erasmus_2018-1-BE02-KA102-046757_4"], [2016, "Arbeiten und Lernen in Europa - Kooperationsprojekt der Bildungsregion Darmstadt-Dieburg", "ADC Technology Training Ltd", 246057.0, 10, 16, "The partners of the consortium in the project \u201eWorking and Learning in Europe \u2013 a collaboration in the regional education system of Darmstadt-Dieburg\u201c are the Landrat-Gruber-Schule (LGS), the Martin-Behaim-Schule (MBS), the Heinrich-Emanuel-Merck-Schule (HEMS) and the Chamber of Commerce Darmstadt (IHK Darmstadt Rhein Main Neckar) as well as the Chamber of Crafts Frankfurt-Rhein-Main as a silent partner.The three schools have shown mutual interest in cooperating within the Erasmus+ programme as all of them have major experience and a number of collaborations in an international context.

Waiting for a wanted course is no good for professionalisation.\r\nWe get many requests from abroad to assist in a particular topic unexpectedly. Naturally Mondrian used its own resources. But for the further development and consciousness we would be able to mention this kind of requests in te application in  such a way that it fits in the subsidy program without being very specific.

The Dietrich-Bonhoeffer business college of higher and further education in Detmold, Germany, (dbb), has already taken part in the joint project \u201cFit f\u00fcr Europa\u201d, a cooperation between colleges in our region. There has been an increasing number of full-time students as well as apprentices who are interested in work experiences abroad. Within this project \u201cMake a move\u201d these participants have the opportunity to search for work experience placements themselves, the so-called \u201cfree movers\u201d, or dbb offers placements within its range of co-operations abroad.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe overall objectives of this project are to allow students to gain an insight into the working environment of a foreign business and to develop their professional, communication as well as personal and interpersonal skills. Furthermore, participants of this project increase their mobility, flexibility and self-confidence. Improving foreign language skills in everyday life and in their working environment and further development of intercultural awareness are very essential issues within this project.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nThe participants study vocational preparation courses or study towards a work-based qualification to gain job-specific skills. In general, they are in vocational education training so that participants would use their knowledge and skills in their placements of the receiving institutions, organisations or enterprises. The new working environment arouses interest and enhances their professional skills. Thus, this work experience abroad enables them to put their skills and experience acquired into practice.\r\nApproximately 30 students and apprentices per year have been delegated to carry out their work experience abroad. Within this project \u201cMake a move\u201d, dbb has planned to send 100 participants to various countries over a period of 24 months.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nThroughout the entire project, the dbb project team advises and monitors the participants from the initial step to the follow-up phase. This includes their application, first contact to businesses abroad, travel arrangements and work experience assignments including the evaluation of activities and the learning outcomes of participants. The project team gives information on procedures for grant application and guides them in handing in all required documents. Before the student mobility, the \u201cLearning Agreement\u201d is set up to include all the learning outcomes the participant is expected to acquire during the work experience abroad. Dbb also offers intercultural preparation courses to the participants to teach cross-cultural awareness and competences. After the mobility the participants inform dbb students or apprentices about their experiences abroad. On the open day at dbb they give a presentation to interested learners and parents in the format of a PowerPoint presentation. \r\n\r\nLearning outcomes and long-term benefits:\r\nThe participants improve their level of key competences and skills, with particular regard to their relevance for the labour market both nationally and internationally. In general, they enhance their opportunities of employability and improve their career prospects. Staying and working abroad gives the participants a broader understanding of cultural diversity. Moreover, it improves foreign language competences in everyday life as well as in their working environment. In the long run, this mobility project is expected to have an impact on the way of operating towards our students and apprentices by offering for example more attractive programmes at dbb in line with their needs and expectations. Dbb is ready to integrate good practices and new methods. Furthermore, the project team expects to attract new resources for mobility opportunities.

Drop-out rates in higher education are, therefore extremely high.\r\nAlso pupils that take vocational training see themselves often confronted with a choice of profession that does not suit them after all. Also they need to receive better information and guidance regarding their professional possibilities. It is important that youngsters make work of a thorough self-reflection as to what would match their possibilities, interests and abilities. As a school, we should be there to guide and support them during this process. Secondary school need to make more specific and more thorough work developing a necessary and qualitative advisory function towards their student\r\nPupils need to test-drive the sector and profession of their choice during an internship. Pupils need more practical experience It is of utmost importance, not only to study their possibilities in theory, but to practice different work situation in real-life.

Already acquired competences can be integrated within their the specific context of their internship. Also new competences will be developed.  During an internship period, pupils experience the specific company-culture and learn to cope with the practical demands that employers put on employees.

Many students grew up in rural areas and in a rather uneducated environment. They are still very young- mainly underage. Therefore, they have barley any experience with mobility projects. All students are already in their second year of their initial training programme, which means that they already have some good knowledge of the particular everyday-working-life. Due to the fact that most of the students just hold a successful certificate of secondary education (CSE) they have limited (native and foreign) language skills, which need to be improved. Additionally, most of our students haven\u2019t had any experience with migrants so far. Their experiences refer to asylum seekers and gastarbeiter and they are rather based on prejudices. However, it is getting even more important in their kind of jobs, to get insights into working structures of other countries and to develop intercultural and personal skills through the exposure to strange cultures. \r\nAs a result, basic project targets must be:\r\n- Application of the English language in daily life and to reduce fears of contacts with foreign languages and cultures\r\n- To gain professional skills by learning about new educational focuses in the partner country and through exploring the differences and similarities in the education.  \r\n- Establishment of personal skills, like self-confidence and so on.\r\n\r\nThe number of participants is limited to 20 students per flow, since most of them are underage, which leads to a higher need of care and support. Additionally, financial costs are playing a big part, because many of our student\u2019s families live in limited monetary boundaries, who can barely accomplish any additional cost.  \r\nTo develop a feeling for the language and to learn how to act self-respondent in an urban area, it is absolutely necessary to have a one-week language course before the placement takes place. The placement in the different professional areas lasts two weeks and gives first insights in the working-structures of the host country. The dealing with the different culture of the host country will be supported by the accompanying teachers in the afternoons of the first week and at the weekends, additional to their lives in the host families and at work of social facilities. \r\nThe organisation of the mobility, like insurance, transportation to the airport, flight booking and flight, transportation in greater London will be done by the sending organisation. They will also help to organise special needs like visa applications.  The partner organisation is responsible for the organisation of the host families, the placement companies and the first information for the participants. During the whole mobility, the participants will be accompanied by both organisations. Placement visits  as well as personal and intercultural care and support will be done by the accompanying persons. Regular meetings at the partner organisation will be done to monitor, evaluate and ensure the learning progresses. \r\nThere are many expected effects:\r\nA strong personal effect on the participant\u2019s self-confidence can be expected. The certainty to have been able to orientate in a metropolis supports the self-confidence as well as the experience to handle a new and strange situation. In the future, the willingness will be enforced to face and go through new and uncertain, anxiety-ridden situations. \r\nEffects on the language can be already expected during the first week of the stay, when the participants realize, that they are always able to find ways to express themselves \u2013 the main thing is that they dare to use the language. Language skills in vocabulary, through frequent speaking, as well as active and passive understanding will be improved, because the contact to migrants and British dialects require concentrated listening. \r\nIn London-Harrow, in their families and working facilities, the participants will have contact to British people with different cultural background, which can be from Rumania, Jamaica or India. In that way they will be forced to deal with different cultures on a personal and culinary level and as well as the differences in values and conventions. This leads to a questioning of own prejudices and to a curiosity of foreign cultures.\r\nTo compare the professional facilities, the concepts and the working structure of the host country to the working situation at home and the questioning of familiar habits, lead to the ability to recognize connections and  dependencies in values of different cultural backgrounds.

Employment policies will be analyzed through activities to be carried out under 4 main topics and the data to be compiled will be disseminated to individuals at all levels and groups through the web page. I- Analyzing the relationship between vocational training and employment: Vocational training, helping individuals to acquire knowledge, skills and behaviors regarding a specific profession, improving personal skills of the individual and helping him/her to gain social and economic strength is indispensable for any country. In today\u2019s world of fierce competition, main expectations from schools delivering vocational training are considering their students and graduates as valuable assets generated by these schools, educating their students with curricula that is compatible with the expectations of the industry, and supporting them following graduation during job seeking process and actual working life. Consequently the basic objective of vocational training is to meet qualified work force requirements of the business world. Activities planned under this project will serve the purpose of ensuring continuous interaction of vocational training schools with the labor market and directing vocational training in line with the demands of the labor market with a view to accelerating harmonization with employment policies of the European Union. For this purpose, expectations of the business world from vocational training in partner countries will be identified, professional qualifications in three designated careers (machinery, textile, computer technologies) will be compared, criteria for career orientation and measurement tools will be reviewed and innovative perspective will be developed for new professions.2--Business set up processes and personal networking: The purpose of vocational training is not only helping individuals to acquire professional knowledge, skills and personal traits that are required in the labor market and to be recruited by an enterprise as a salary earner but also helping them to acquire entrepreneurship skills and traits to be used by the individual to become an employer. Providing the market with qualified work force alone will be meaningless if entrepreneurs do not generate new areas for employment by making investments. Professionals with high entrepreneurship skills, who are capable of starting up their own businesses are in need throughout the world.  Contacting business sectors and related individuals through the internet is very important nowadays. Partner countries will prepare lecture notes and books to serve this purpose. Documents will be prepared on personal networking. Furthermore, an entrepreneurship book will be prepared in audio book format for the visually impaired and made available to access by disadvantaged groups.3--Business organization and orientation processes: The purpose of training is to help individuals to adapt to the working environment in order to reveal their potential and to be effective and productive. Until now, individuals skilled enough to perform duties assigned to them through defined methodologies were used to be called \u201equalified employees\u201c, however in today\u2019s global world, qualifications expected from a qualified employee include assuming responsibility, innovative thinking, adaptation to change,  problem solving, good communication skills, group work, cooperativeness and a quick grasp of complex technological systems. Main purpose of formal vocational training is to train individuals that are fit for global competition, who will be an asset for their employer giving him a competitive edge. 4-Employment policies:  Employment oriented studies in partner countries on the basis of their basic political strategies will be reviewed. Employment policies will be reviewed from the perspective of connections between employment agencies and active work force, the business world and the unemployed. Additionally each partner will organize a panel on the importance of employment and expectations of the business world from vocational training sector.The web page to be prepared by the project will be available for access by everyone.

Nevertheless, the recent economic and financial crisis reinforced significantly the negative attitudes towards the \u201eothers\u201c that the increased mobility evoked after the EU Enlargement. Nowadays, the flow of refugees has fueled into the existing hostility towards people with different cultural background. Diversity has become a challenge that people face and deal with on a daily basis. Acknowledging that the educational institutions are the first place where diversities meet and interact on a daily basis and that they are the first pillar of the societal integration and acculturation, the project will address the topic of Diversity Management at school, focusing on the teachers as key actors in the process of transfer of knowledge, values, skills and competences. In contrast to the numerous initiatives providing the teachers will skills and competences of 'how to teach diversity', the current project will focus on one significant gab, identified in the teachers' training: WHY to teach diversity, how to TEACH IN diversity and HOW TO MANAGE diversity. The project addresses three key issues: (1) the challenge of knowledge-based adequate management of the growing diversity in Europe, especially in connection of the current refugee crisis, with the aim of fostering inclusion and societal integration yet at the school level,(2) the identified gap in the professional development of school teachers equipping them with the needed knowledge and understanding (of the fundamental principles and legislative frameworks regulating the human and minority rights protection and shaping the European values and norms) that will enable them to teach intercultural competences and skills to students and to manage successfully intercultural communication, potential intercultural clashes and learning outcomes; and (3) the establishment of an international teachers' network for continuous and real-time self support in managing of diversity. The three specific needs are intertwined and crucial for the development of an inclusive European society, where the educational institutions are the first point of intercultural interaction and acculturation. The project aims to address these needs in a comprehensive but practical manner focusing on the management of diversity through daily application of the human and minority rights. The transnational approach is therefore essential - although all of these are European goals based on the common European values, each country faces particular issues and had specific educational environment and practices. By involving 8 countries in the project implementation, the partnership believes that the project outputs will integrate the common European elements and issues and in the same time will be nationally-adaptable. This will ensure their validity and transferability to other European countries but in the same time, the products will be relevant and directly usable throughout Europe. The key project goals have therefore been defined as:1. Teachers' empowerment through:  - Development of solid knowledge and understanding of diversity management (legal frameworks, standards, principles and practices, values and competences) - Enabling the knowledge-based transfer and development of civic competences from teachers to their students- Raising awareness about diversity management mechanisms and development of new skills and approaches to diversity2. Supporting the early societal integration at school level through development of educational staff aware of and knowledgeable  about culture-sensitive learning, mechanisms for mitigating intercultural conflicts, facilitating intercultural communication3. Establishment of an international educators' network for real time self-support in addressing diversity challenges and of a mobile application for facilitating the network's interaction4. Development of a training module and open educational resources in diversity management for teachers and 5.

The importance of facilitating integration in digital and financial literacy relies on the fact that the same EU adult citizens structurally face deceptive usage of unsolicited emails, phone calls, emails, put under pressure in learning new lexicon and not reaching everyday financial sustainability. Migrants face worse conditions than EU citizens, and higher numbers of migrant adults risk to fall into debt or to pay for what they have not asked for, failing then to reach their everyday sustainability, systematically reinforce the connection between digital dis-empowerment and social exclusion, as also shown by the EU Digital Agenda founding document. Financial inclusion of migrants is atop of the agenda in inclusion discussions, as many European citizens have started showing intolerance, lack of understanding of the problems of the inclusion process.\r\nAt the moment, in Europe there are different initiatives coming from the banks, from OECD discussions and papers (particularly from 2012 commitments in cutting down the cost of remits) that should encourage migrants and minorities.

This is due to the fact that entrepreneurship has not been celebrated as a preferred career path\u201d Despite the fact that entrepreneurs create jobs and power the economy their successes are not presented as role models in the media. For some people, this makes an entrepreneurial career rank rather low in the list of attractive professions and it is a deterrent to those who might want to become entrepreneurs.An important element to change the entrepreneurial culture is thus a change in the perception of entrepreneurs through practical and positive communication about the achievements of entrepreneurs, their value to society and the opportunities of new businesscreation or acquisition as a career destination. To achieve this, their visibility as role models must be stepped up, taking into account the diversity of entrepreneurial profiles and paths to success.

We have 5 countries and 5 institutions working with adults in total. The partner institutions are from Turkey, England, Germany, Romania and Italy. The rationale of this project mainly depends on a needs analysis and questionnaires applied to our teachers and adult learners at the institutions. These questionnaires showed us that teachers who work with adults find themselves insufficient and not fully equipped about the ICT use during their classes. Also, we realized that adult learners are not motivated enough to use ICT tools during the classes and also in their daily lives. After online meetings with the partners, we found out that every partner has experience on different aspects of adult education and similar needs for their institutions. Therefore, we decided to develop our educators' competences in different aspects thanks to variety of our partners' experience, to motivate adult learners in ICT use and to make the best use of the facilities at our institutions.       Furthermore, we examined some articles and researches about the topic of our project and it became clear that the technology goes on developing constantly but we cannot keep up with it in our adult education systems. Almost all institutions have some technological facilities. When the efficiency of these facilities is checked, either very few number of teachers use them during their classes or the ones who use these facilities cannot use the ICT tools efficiently as it should be. Also, we realized that most of the countries do not have an ICT policy specifically linked to the adult learning and a small number of countries has policies on the use of ICT in adult learning. This project is going to be an initiative for this matter.       The primary aims of this project are to develop our educators' competences in using ICT in classroom atmosphere by making every participant an active part of our project activities. Beside that, we aim to make our educator capable to modify the current curriculum or create new ones which contain ICT and adult teaching. In order to reach these aims, we planned some courses/workshops and seminars with experts in order to show every participant how important it is and will be to use ICT in adult education in today's world.       International teaching and learning activities are planned to make it possible for the participants to observe other nations, take part in international activities and to feel a member of a rich team. For the teachers and the management staff, these meetings will also be great opportunities to share experiences and exchange good practices with their colleagues.        To make the activities more effective and to make our educators fully equipped in ICT field, each partner selected at least one of the platforms or the software on computer and planned to organize applied activities and seminars during the visits. All of the attendants will be required to make a little research about the chosen subject and the country before the meeting and  by doing so they will be informed about what they will get during the lessons, the culture of the host country and their language in detail. While taking these courses and applying them in demo classes, the teachers will be able to improve their foreign language abilities because they will get some language support before the visits. Also, apart from the activities, educational courses/seminars, workshops and some cultural activities are planned for each project meeting, in order to reach further impacts, not only technological capability and awareness. Some experts on adult education and ICT will join these mini-courses and seminars. And there will be some field trips to the institutions related with adult education and technology.        For dissemination activities and sustainability activities a plan and task sharing is prepared, and every partner is given some responsibility for these phases of project.

Its approximately 200 students, some of whom are currently employed and some in need of work, are of various ages. The fact that they have decided to attend this type of vocational school clearly indicates that they understand the necessity to improve both their formal qualifications and their practical knowledge. They realize that limited qualifications in the present financial circumstances and with increasing competition can be an obstacle in their effort to secure a work position and only further training regardless of their age can provide an advantage.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the project\r\nFor the reasons mentioned above, the proposed mobility project under the title \u2018Entrepreneurship in a Digital Era\u2019 aims at acquainting the students with educational systems and work environments that reflect the latest technological developments both in industry and services using digital and automation systems. Close contact of the trainees with enterprises that use contemporary systems and facilities will provide an opportunity for their familiarization with today\u2019s professional demands. We correlate entrepreneurship in a digital era to an increase of employability and the financial growth of the individual.\r\n\r\nProfile of participants\r\nMore specifically, the trainees who are interested in participating in this mobility project belong to a wide range of ages from 17 to 55 years old. Only a small percentage of them have a full-time job or a job related to their studies. Most of them are unemployed or under-employed in jobs completely irrelevant to their chosen field of study. The majority are people with a low income. The fact that they have chosen to attend an evening school suggests their need to work for a living along with attending school. In general, their working experience is limited and their assertiveness to seek professions with a high level of social acceptance or economic gain is quite low. They wish to attend specialized courses in their selected field of study and approach innovative practices in order to improve their skills, which can be catalytic in starting or upgrading a profession.\r\n\r\nNumber of participants \u2013 description of activities \u2013 methodology\r\nWe intend to involve 48 students in the proposed mobility project. The number of participants will be obtained from four different fields of study. They will be escorted by 8 teachers each with the respective specialty. The project will be realized in four different flows, in three separate countries. These countries have been selected in relation to their expertise in the field of study of the trainees. The teachers who will participate, after considering their own experience, the current literature and extensive internet research, have concluded that the students should be placed as follows for practical training, technical visits and cultural activities:\r\n1st flow: 12 students from the field of Economics Administration will visit Spain, a country well-known for its tourist facilities. The participants will undertake a training placement in selected enterprises that offer high quality tourist services.\r\n2nd flow: 12 students from the field of Applied Arts will visit the centre of design and visual communication, United Kingdom. The participants will undertake a training placement in the advertising agencies\u2019 creative departments.\r\n3rd flow: 12 students from the field of Information Technology will visit Germany, the leader among European countries in businesses management systems. The participants will undertake a training placement in developing firms that implement advantageously the benefits of new technologies and digital transformations.\r\n4th flow: 12 students from the field of Electronic, Electrical and Automation Technician will visit Germany, a pioneer in digital technology and networks.

The first foreign language is taught within two hours a week during the four years of highschool, the second language is given, beginning with the superior cycle, which is from the 11th and 12th grades, only one hour of study. The students who choose to take the certificate which allows them to teach the foreign language (they may choose the first and/or the second foreign language, or both of them) are allocated, according to the present curriculum, only half an hour. This means that during one half an hour a week of pedagogical practice we must achieve the teaching of the foreign language didactics (French or English) as well as the accomplishment of the foreign language practice stage. Therefore, it is obvious that the foreign languages teachers, methodologists of the pedagogical practice, make huge efforts to raise the students\u2019 language level within 2 hours or even one a week, same time which is also allocated for teaching the foreign language didactics.  This project was designed as a consequence of our needs, thouroughly analysed and researched, and it aims at completing students\u2019 education in the field of acquiring linguistic knowledge, abilities and competences in order to teach foreign languages at primary level, education which cannot be achieved under best circumstances currently, at the \u201cVasile Lupu\u201d Pedagogical Highschool, only because of the allocated time of teaching within the present curriculum (half an hour a week) for the pedagogical practice and the teaching of the foreign language methodology.    The objectives of this project are the following:1. To acquire specific methods and strategies of teaching-learning the foreign languages at primary level: teaching the vocabulary items, the phonetics, the grammar, the communicative structures. 2. To develop the competence of speaking and writing in the foreign language, of socially interaction with the pupils. 3. To develop the competence of writing the didactic project in the foreign language, according to the curriculum and the study level.  4. To develop the competence of intercultural communication in professional context. The target group is made up of 32 students of the \u201cVasile Lupu\u201d Pedagogical Highschool, pedagogical profile from 10th and 11th grades, registered at pedagogical practice of a foreign language, who are going to take the foreign language certificate for teaching at primary level, at the end of 12th grade.  The certificate of foreign language teaching at primary level is taken, each year, by students who choose either French or English. Thus, the project takes into account the students\u2019 training for the two languages: a first flow of 16 students for english and a second flow of students for taking the french certificate. In order to accomplish these objectives, the students will perform the following activities:1. Acquiring the foreign language methods and strategies of teaching at primary level: teaching the phonetics, the vocabulary, the communicative structures by solving the work tasks during the training. 2. Taking actively part to workshops, having as themes methods and strategies of teaching foreign  languages at primary level.  3. Noticing and writing down in their training notebook the demands expressed by the teacher using the foreign language, the social interaction phrases in the classroom, during  watching the lessons at primary level.  4. Writing the didactic projects for different activities using the foreign language. 5. Performing a lesson sequence using the foreign language.  The students will speak and write in the foreign language under authentic learning contexts. During the first week, they will acquire foreign language teaching methods and strategies in the group workshops, they will have the opportunity to practice their knowledge by making didactic projects and solving practical tasks.  During the second week, they will have a practical stage at primary schools, where they will watch the foreign language activities, they will make up didactic projects and they will perform sequences of foreign language activities, they will interact with the pupils, the tutor and the mentor using the foreign language.

However, for over a decade the unemployment rate of young people in the EU has remained approximately at double the rate of the overall unemployment in the economy while, at the same time, the use of flexible, fixed-term contracts and alternative forms of employment has been increasing.\r\nThis has resulted in growing job insecurity and systematic labour market and social exclusion of young people at the very beginning of their professional careers with many of them moving directly from education to unemployment or taking up temporary jobs below their qualifications. The crisis has exacerbated this trend raising the threat of a 'lost generation' in particular in some European countries, as social disadvantages of young unemployed are multi-faceted, including for example higher risk of poverty, precariousness and social exclusion, disaffection, insecurity, higher propensity towards offence and crime, as well as health problems.

However, there is a lack of knowledge of how a market function. If markets fail like during the financial crisis 2008, questions raise but often too simple answers are given. Moreover, the European countries face economic instabilities but the problems of for example the euro project are not understood by many citizens. Economic issues such as inflation, deflation, the role of a central bank in a currency area, consumers' debts, etc. are often regarded as being too complex and complicated. This meets a widely spread feeling of uncertainty. As people normally refer to interpretations in public discourse, there is a threat that they may get attracted by nationalist perspectives on economic, social and political phenomenons. Democracy needs education. At least a basic economic education is indispensable that learners learn overcoming uncertainty, finding orientation, developing their own point of view, and practicing tolerance, humanity and respect.

They have undergone a transformation from visible to more latent forms and are manifested in popular social networking sites (hereafter SNS). Youth, the main users of these sites, are particularly affected by and exposed to racist and discriminatory messages, that in forms of images, videos, comments, are circulated in SNS. Users can be easily mislead, since \u201ccloaked\u201d (disguised)  forms of discrimination are hidden in false, \u201cpolitically correct discourses\u201d, like \u201cI am not a racist, but... \u201c. While taking into consideration how these sites constitute a powerful form of non-formal learning, recognizing how youth in particular are challenged by online racist contents, this project is directed towards providing guidance for vulnerable community members who are more likely to face discrimination (i.e. migrants, certain ethnic and cultural groups, young people at risk of social exclusion, their parents and educators) and for everyone willing to act against these conducts, such as NGOs, media content providers, community managers, local and national authorities.

This project will consist of similar stages as the original one although consist of different partner countries and take shorter period of time (12 instead of 24 months). The project will use the methodology of the original ICUD to prepare the participating youth workers to learn and use and share the antidiscrimination pack.  The project is aimed:-to share methodology worked out during the project INTERNET: CREATIVELY UNVEILING DISCRIMINATION (I:CUD) called \u2018antidiscrimination pack\u2019 which has been done by CEPS SOCIALS PROJECTS (http://digitaldiscrimination.eu/);-to enable and support young people to become active and responsible digital users;-to assess and reflect on their own use of technology, make changes, challenge and combat digital discrimination.The project provides a practical guide on how to unveil masked discriminatory practices: to show a way of becoming creative \u201cprosumers\u201d, who do not just passively \u201cconsume discriminatory contents\u201d but actively produce material counteracting such conducts.  There are 3 accumulative phases of the project, the framing research process (1), the action pilot  process (2) and the communication and dissemination process (3) can be understood as logical steps in order to prepare our youth workers to learn, test the antidiscrimination pack and later share it, an integrated and interactive tool that includes reflections of people working with youth and young people themselves.Phase 1- based on the rules set by the original project the partner organizations collect theoretical frame and case studies within their interdisciplinary groups (teachers, social workers, youth trainers, community managers) to discuss and work out possible ways of acting against and combating discriminatory material in SNS. During this process the methodology of the second phase will also be outlined by the P1.Phase 2\u2013 based on the research done in phase 1 the partners test the original antidiscrimination pack. They learn themselves to use it and organize creative and empowering activities with young people aged 15-30 at risk of social exclusion, members of communities who are marginalized and are more likely to be exposed to discrimination online or face-to-face. Participants of the pilot groups will receive training followed by digital sessions, during which they can express their thoughts and reactions in form of short videos. In this way the project gives voice to the mainly affected and integrates their ideas in a practical tool designed for actions. The original anti-discrimination pack can be in this way also improved by new ideas and experiences. The original antidiscrimination pack enriched by our amendments (Anti discrimination Pack 2.0 \u2013 further called AP) will be accompanied by a new web platform that will include recent case studies floating in SNS, short videos, collected by the partners and a methodological guide divided into a theoretical frame and an integrated practical part with concrete steps to be followed.Phase 3 foresees a 4-month dissemination process during which local dissemination events will take place across the partner countries as well as follow-up trainings provided by participating youth workers. These actions will be organized and attended by altogether 15 youth workers from PL,  DE, ES, UK and CY and tutored by 2 educators from the mentoring CEPS from Spain and 1 facilitator from Dramblys.

Responding to the growing number of special needs students through the methodological innovation and learning best practices from Europe. Our school is very attentive to the training of teachers in inclusion and we believe that the exercise of comparison with European colleagues can increase the skills of the school on this important and sensitive issue.This needs analysis resulted in the preparation of FLASH, which thus aims to achieve the following general objectives:- Promote quality improvements, innovation excellence and internationalization, particularly through enhanced transnational cooperation with our European partners to enable us to understand methodologies and approaches, overcoming the difficulties encountered by comparison on the field ;- Improve the ability of teachers participating in the mobility project and part of the working group \"Erasmus +\" to determine changes in terms of modernization and internationalization of our school;- Improve the understanding of the practices, policies and systems of higher school education (age 14-19) in the partner countries;and to achieve the following specific objectives:- improve the language skills and the intercultural awareness of a specific target group of teachers interested in learning more about European cooperation;- Improve the understanding of the interconnections between formal and non-formal education, vocational training and the labor market: all partner schools are in fact mixed institutes general + VET providing considerable attention to training for entry into the labor market, to self-employment and to a good alternance between school and work;-Improve the ability to address the needs of the least advantaged, with specific reference to the acquisition of skills in the area of inclusive best practices.The project involves 9 units of teaching staff in 18 mobilities, including 9 job shadowing and 9 training courses. The staff corresponds to different teaching profiles i.e. art, natural sciences, languages and Italian literature. These teachers are those who, following a transparent and participatory process of selection, have shown a greater motivation to follow a path of internationalization and modernization of its skills, and who take part to the working group \"Erasmus +\".
