The TACMON technology is innovative in that it applies electrostatic MEMS actuator technologies with a micro hydraulic amplitude transmission to realize a large matrix of tactile dots using cost-effective bath-processing technologies. There are 7.4 million visually impaired people in the European Union. High unemployment amongst the disabled is a serious social and economic problem for the EU, as continued exclusion from productive activity requires increasing state-funded support for social programs. There is a need for effective assistive technology to facilitate employment of the visually impaired and for industry to better be able to meet anti-discrimination legislation. Furthermore, the EU is investing heavily in e-learning to modernize education and training, but locking out the visually impaired since information and communication technologies are heavily oriented to visual user interfaces. The EU must quickly address the needs of sector SMEs that provide technological solutions for the disabled, as there is a continuous competitive threat from both foreign companies and large enterprises. TACMON offers SMEs an innovative technology targeting an interactive graphical tactile display and user interface for the visually impaired to access electronic information. TACMON technology can contribute to the creation of new business opportunities in software for learning, leisure, communicating via Internet, among many others for the disabled community.

These approaches will be based on  achieving work based learning, and producing tangible joint outcomes, training material and tools. The final products will be designed to be easily accessible to  trainers and teachers in other EU countries.The partnership chose ceramic as the central topic of the project with the purpose of exchange good practices, because working with clay offers the opportunity for each individual to participate in a practical creative process. The kind of group learning activity is relevant to the acquisition of social skills. It generates a feeling of wellbeing by the easiness of getting along well with others. It enables communication and can even develop a sense of citizenship. The primary goal is to allow partner organizations to develop and reinforce EU networks for teaching and learning ceramic craft, increasing trainers and staff capacity to work at transnational level, sharing and exchanging ideas, improving knowledge about practices and ceramic crafts methods and inclusive teaching techniques. The partnership also will  produce tangible outputs such as: a video of the ceramic course implementation, an e-book on the workshops held in each partner country, and collective creations of objects that represent the partner country in the idea of the participating target groups. The objects created in the workshops will be filmed to form a virtual exhibition on the project website that will also document the audience on how working the clay can be used as a means for inclusion, to share the culture of people with diverse background.The project partners are all actors involved in VET field.  The  partners come from PL, ET, PT, UK, IT, and most of them have already gained experience in the Program Erasmus +.  One partner is a newcomer, but has experience in the specific field of  CERAMIC craft.Working with ceramics has  a value recognized historically worldwide: many migrants arriving to Europe know this craft. The project will emphasize the relationship between the artisan/artist and his/her creations. It wants to highlight the real sense of \u201chandmade\u201d products and enhance the development of creative abilities while fostering social inclusion. Our goal is to provide an occasion for Intercultural exchange through which mutual cultures, of locals and immigrants, can be known and valued. The workshops carried out at a local level in each participating country will motivate migrants to meet and learn together in a collaborative way and to acquire knowledge of rules and habits of their hosting societies in a direct and informal key. The project will reach relevant stakeholders of local communities in the world of ceramics and crafts. These have already been identified at application stage. They will be involved in local activities and will bring their knowledge of traditional pottery techniques. There are different layers of evaluation which will be employed in the project. There are aspects of self-evaluation and of external evaluation.At local level: we will establish a network among trainers, associations and experts to work further on the topic, to share experiences.At regional level: we will establish a network among labor market access departments, employment centers, commerce chamber, ceramists local associations, arts and crafts associations, representatives of language schools to learners of a second language, local decision makers about immigration policy.All partners have plans to use the project resources and the exchange of good practices. All partners will contribute on local and national dissemination to make the European project results visible through the project website. All will contribute to build the Ceramic-ally network.  Tools for dissemination will be: a website,  a video about CERAMIC-ALLY training course, e-book, logo and brochure about Ceramic-ally, panels in each partner institution as well as a Ceramic-ally exhibition with visual boards.Ceramic-ally networking will create a long-lasting tie between participating countries.", "http://www.mosaicartsound.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA202-026455_3"], [2016, "Specific Training Aiming at Renewable energies and Sustainability", "The Mosaic Art And Sound Ltd.", 12464.0, 4, 4, "Sustainability is a major concern for today's societies and the European VET sector also has to face this challenge by preparing learners for the new objectives which are pointed out in the strategy \"Europe 2020\" and by being closer to the industrial world. This is the reason why 5 European institutions created a partnership whose main goal is to contribute to support young learners or adults in the reach of knowledge, competences and qualifications, in order to facilitate their integration in the professional fields of renewable energies or ecobuilding.To reach this goal, the Lyc\u00e9e Charles Augustin COULOMB initially elaborated a 3-step European Development Plan :- Phase n\u00b01 (preparatory step) : search of potential European partners ;- Phase n\u00b02 (Leonardo da Vinci partnership with 4 other VET institutions, \"European Training Modules-Renewable Energies\", reference 2012-1-FR1-LEO04-35536 1) : creation of a European training kit called \"STARS\" (\"Specific Training Aiming at Renewable energies and Sustainability\") including 5 different and complementary training modules which offer several possible solutions to the following question : \"How to get energetical self-sufficiency in a European village ?\" ;- Phase n\u00b03 (individual mobilities of learners) : launching of a sustainable project proposing European mobilities to the specific needs of the 5 institutions' learners who would like to get some advantage from the \"STARS\" programme.The forecasted mobilities are related to 12 French learners of the Lyc\u00e9e Charles Augustin COULOMB, selected in order to follow one foreign training module of the \"STARS\" programme. These learners are completing their STI2D Baccalaur\u00e9at national curriculum and they have got specific learning in European classes. The third step of the European Development Plan will reinforce their national training (which is already focused on technology and sustainability) adding a different concrete experiment and allowing them to live a unique moment mixing intercultural, linguistic and vocational dimensions and making their potential employability rise.Such a project will normally have a substantial impact both on the VET sector and on many actors taking part in environment, social studies or economy (public authorities or private entities).In order to make this mobility project more visible, a large dissemination plan has been thought. This plan will use different informatory tools (event days, leaflets and posters, multimedia documents, new ICT tools) and it will be focused on each impacted sector.The \"STARS\" programme was elaborated with a strong will to reach sustainable mobilities of learners througout Europe.
