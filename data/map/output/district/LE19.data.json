Key features are, only a single sensor is needed to identify the wide range of object sizes, the sensor has no rotating parts & operates in all weathers.ES24 will enable track operators to monitor whether the track is clear or an object has been detected, significantly improving safety for both train passengers & crossing users.\nMore than 2,000 significant accidents occur each year on EU member states\u2019 railways.

Each significant LC accident is estimated to cost \u20ac1.7m, i.e. \u20ac974m for 2012. LC accidents have damaging impact on the key rail transport strengths: safety, reliability & speed.\nCurrent object detection (LCOD) systems are expensive, have limited capability in terms of the size of object detected, need combined laser & radar sensor solutions to meet operator needs & generally have rotating parts requiring on-going maintenance.
