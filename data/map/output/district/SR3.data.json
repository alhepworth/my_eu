In each region it brings together 2 secondary and 4 primary schools to work with the local authority and an additional expert partner. Half of the pilot schools in each region have been involved in previous transnational education activity, while half are inexperienced.The 16 project partners are collaborating to achieve the following objectives:\u2022 8 sustainable bilateral partnerships which include regular communication between staff and learners using a variety of media (including virtual methods, letters, phone calls and visits) and which strengthen the longstanding partnership between the two regions.\u2022 Transnational project management experience and capacity within all 16 organisations\u2022 Sharing of best practice on delivering education on Health, Sport, Nutrition and Wellbeing, as well as Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) and Information Communications Technology (ICT)\u2022 Sharing of resources among schools, local authorities and expert partners, particularly on topics surrounding health education, global citizenship, ICT and MFL.\u2022 Healthier participating organisations which are delivering more concrete activities related to the project topic and improved academic attainment of young people.\u2022 Provision of meaningful contexts for work on MFL (exchange work with counterparts in target language) and ICT (eTwinning, video-conferencing, blog, social media) which should motivate learning in these disciplines.\u2022 Widened perspectives of staff and learners through transnational work.\u2022 Understanding of own and others\u2019 identities, shared history and present, and place in Europe and the wider world.\u2022 Empowering of learners to lead activities and take responsibility for project delivery.\u2022 Increased confidence of staff and learners in a range of areas, particularly MFL, leadership, communication, teamwork, and international working.\u2022 Production of resources for use by schools more widely including digital content and a project DVD. This toolkit should support practitioners in all Sunderland/Saint-Nazaire schools to deliver transnational school projects (particularly with focus on MFL, Global Citizenship, Social inclusion and School achievement through healthy living styles).\u2022 Delivery of dissemination events to share project results and transnational project management experience and to support other organisations to consider future applications for transnational projects.\u2022 Promotion and publicity for European transnational project work.All partners bring significant experience to the project in different areas, and will be responsible for delivering content, as outlined in project partnership agreements. Additional partners will play a key role in developing content and activities and will use their expertise in the project theme to support schools to achieve the E-SCHOLAR objectives.Project partners will use a variety of methods to deliver this work, including:\u2022 virtual communication\u2022 joint project work\u2022 parallel activities, with preparation and results shared\u2022 events, including sports festivals organised by project partners\u2022 participation in initiatives including Journ\u00e9es sportives, Sport Relief, World Food Day\u2022 training (both within individual partner regions and jointly and offered by project partners and additional stakeholders)\u2022 meetings and workshops with relevant stakeholders\u2022 invitation to speakers to inform learning\u2022 dissemination events\u2022 production of multimedia toolkit including digital resources and DVD\u2022 regular press releases and social media content during E-SCHOLAR\u2019s term\u2022 systematic monitoring and evaluation of project activities throughout its lifetimeThey will also use travel to one another\u2019s regions to deliver other activities.

Work and domestic life is changed very fast by the new technologies. In the same time, according to European analysis and forecasts there is a lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs caused by the declining interest for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines. \r\nThe interpretation of PISA results indicates a low level of students competencies in applying their knowledge in real life situations. On the other hand, these tests shown a lack of students motivations for studying and their disappointment about school and education. Also, the results of a survey made by the NGO partner of this consortium, who was applied on high school students from Romania indicate a perceived irrelevance of the school and a lack of teachers interest for new technologies and new methods. Analyzing the current situation in the schools involved in the project, despite the natural differences, we realized that we all have in common a problem: low motivation and low results in maths discipline.\r\nThe partnership includes 4 organization which activate in the education field (school education institutions, higher-education and NGO who activates in training pupils, students, adults in education) \u2013 RO, UK,IE. There are 3 organizations in our consortium who never participate at this kind of action, and that new situation will produce a high impact on their future activities. \r\nThe project address a target group of students aged 15-18 and teachers of Maths.\r\nIn order to address the issues that we have identified during the need-analysis, our project is proposing the following OBJECTIVES:\r\nO1. Training of 8 teachers/trainers in order to use new teaching methods, design, develop and evaluate Video Learning units;\r\nO2. Realization of 1 Open Online Video Learning Course targeting mathematics learning outcomes  for students aged between 15 \u2013 18 years old;\r\nO3. Involving at least 100 students from the target group (RO&UK) in piloting innovative mathematics classes;\r\nO4. Improve the average results in math classes with at least 10% for the students involved in piloted classes;\r\nO5. Increasing with 20% the satisfaction about mathematics discipline for the students involved in piloted classes.\r\n\r\nWe are taking into account the fact that the generation of students that we address by this project  is very connected to technologies, to on-line information and the video content is more and more popular (4 Million Hours of content uploaded to Youtube every day!) so we want to use it in order to insure the success of the project. \r\nThis project support innovative approaches for addressing the target group by providing more attractive programs and methods for the maths classes. The project promote innovative methods developing learning materials and tools based on IT &C. \r\nOur project is proposing to support the learning process of Maths with video open educational resources (VOER) that will be developed following an innovative methodology that will insure integration of scientific research in the field of education, cooperation among partners from different countries and fields of education. \r\n\r\nThis  project has a very strong inclusive approach since all the learning materials developed will be Open and Online, available in Ro and En.\r\n\r\nTARGET GROUPS:\r\nThereby, our direct target groups can be described and quantified:\r\n - 8 teachers/ trainers and technical experts involved in developing video-learning resources and piloting activities, \r\n- 100 learners from school partners  involved in the design phase and the piloting phase of the open on-line course. \r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT\r\nDeveloping video-learning resources in the field of mathematics and make them available on a multimedia platform, easily accessible and adapted for any kind of device will conduct in improving the motivation of students for study and the overall increase of satisfaction about the educational act.\r\nUsing the video-learning units during the classes of our target groups will conduct to an increased satisfaction about maths of the students involved in piloted classes discipine with 20% and will improve the average results in math classes with at least 10% for the students involved in piloted classes;\r\n\r\nTeachers/experts involved will have the chance to exchange good practices, teaching methods, opinions and will improve English and digital skills, organizational skills, teaching methods and tools.\r\nInstitutions strengthen their cooperation with other European organizations involved in educational field and gain more experience in managing Erasmus+ projects, benefit from better relationships between teaching staff and students, among students and among teachers, which will lead to a better cohesion inside the institution; continue cooperation with partner institutions through the e-learning platform.", "http://www.sunderlandcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-RO01-KA201-037464_2"]]}}}}
