Short and ultrashort pulsed lasers enable producing structures with sub-micron accuracy, for example diesel injection nozzles which help reducing air pollution significantly when compared to nozzles made by conventional fabrication techniques. So far, most of the powerful industrial ultrafast laser sources are operating in the picosecond range, which is sufficient for precision micro-machining of metals. On the other hand, to achieve optimum precision in micro-machining of transparent materials like glass and ceramics, pulse durations in the order of 100 femtoseconds are required. Therefore, the main objective of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of industrial high-average power ultrafast Ti:sapphire (Ti:Sa) lasers and their excellent qualification for demanding high-productivity precision laser mate-rial processing applications. To achieve the targeted high output powers, the thin-disk (TD) geometry shall be employed, which already enabled the efficient generation of up to 740 W of cw fundamental mode power from one Yb:YAG crystal. Symmetrical double-sided cooling with two transparent diamond heat spreaders shall be used to optimize the cooling of the thin Ti:Sa crystal. Within the project, two ultrafast Ti:Sa TD laser systems, one with chirped pulse amplification (CPA) to obtain high-energy pulses and the other without CPA for high repetition rates, both with a maximum average output power of at least 200 W at a pulse duration of well below 100 fs shall be demonstrated. The CPA system, comprising a multipass TD amplifier, shall achieve a pulse energy of 10 mJ at 20 kHz repetition rate. The multipass amplifier will be pumped by two nanosecond pulsed frequency-doubled solid-state lasers developed within the project which are operating at 532 nm with an average output power of 300 W each. The high-repetition rate system shall be a high-power TD oscillator with a pulse energy of 20 \u00b5J at about 10 MHz. A commercial cw Yb:YAG TD laser with intracavity frequency doubling emitting about 500 W at 515 nm shall be used as pump source. To demonstrate the excellent qualification of the ultrafast oscillator for fast, ultra-precise micromachining of transparent materials, high-speed cutting of glass, e.g. Gorilla\u00ae glass, which is widely used for mobile phones and tablets, will be investigated as high-volume reference application. With the CPA system, which is especially well suited for ultra-precise drilling, the ultra-high aspect ratio percussion and single-shot drilling of transparent substrates shall be investigated.

The school is located in \u00c9cija, a 40,000 inhabitants Sevillian town and our students belong to a working families suburb with an average unemployment rate. We are a small school of 24 teachers and 333 students.\r\nRegarding the fact that we live in a world without either frontiers or geographical boundaries, the staff decided it was no possible for our students to set them up due to the lack of the resources needed to break them. It was thought that those limits could be related to the learning of languages and new technologies. If we endow our students with these tools, they will become citizens provided with all the resources needed to settle in any place around the world, no matter language nor culture, and this endowment was acquired in school directly, including every student without caring the way they learn so as to an inclusive education can be a reality in our educational community. To achieve it, the previous and most important step was the teacher\u2019s training who would turn out to be the key in transmission of the knowledge and motivation needed in learning-teaching process.\r\nRecognized our needs, it was decided to obtain the above mentioned formation across the achievement of a project KA1 of Erasmus + with the target of getting the knowledge in advanced methodologies related to languages and technologies to get them in a current and atractive way for students, who are, indeed, our true goal of our project.\r\nTo get a clear process of the project, the School Commission Erasmus + was created , basing on the skill that every member could bring to it (paragraph C.1.3). . The commission, among other responsabilities, would be in charge of deciding the criteria and the selection process in the program. The commission, with school management team altogether,  decided the mobility for 6 teachers, one of them in every Job Shadowing: Methodological Innovation in Technology and Leanguage Learning and Special Needs. It was decided that the formation should be done in September and October in order to begin the academic year with experiences in the courses or stages most suitables to implement it. The chosen teachers must be directly related to the above mentioned subjects in any way and they would carry the adquired skills to other similar subjects, that is, Phonics from Nursery and Primary Education to the rest of the stages, as for Special Needs, a teacher related to Special Needs Education would be suitable,  regarding Methodology CLIL, a teacher who teaches a NLS (Non Linguistic Subject) in stages where the bilingual education is established. Regarding the methodologies related to new digital resourses and subjects, the staff thought of a teacher belonging to secondary stage.\r\nThe above mentioned selection process  will be carried out by the Commission Erasmus+, reported in teachers' meeting, with a clear deadline for applications and selection interviews published in meeting report . In case of the same merits, the teacher  selected will be this one with more service  years in the school, for being him/her considered to be in need of recycling and learning of new methodologies.\r\nEvery Comission Erasmus +  member has been in charge of carrying out a task in the project depending on his/her role in the school and his/her ability of decision making and, as soon as the project evaluation was known , every member will carry out the task entrusted for its flawless achievement (Paragraph G. 1. of the project).\r\nAs for the impact of the project, and keeping in mind that it has been carried out to endow students with the basic tools for succesful learning of foreign languages and new technology, the school expect that teachers adquire the training needed to transmit knowledge about these resourses in a natural way into the school itself without doing any difference in ability for learning. If students find the motivation they need to demolish, among several things, language learning barriers, the project Erasmus + will be considered to be a success by our educational community, so it will have to be shared with the rest of teachers having the same concerns.  To do it, the school Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Valle will create a dissemination network  that will go from a specific level (the school itself ) to the general one (outside the school: activities in I.2.).", "http://www.blewbury.oxon.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-036720_3"], [2018, "R\u016fzn\u00e9 styly v\u00fduky v EU n\u00e1s zaj\u00edmaj\u00ed", "Blewbury Endowed C of E primary School", 5960.0, 3, 3, "he project is in relation to the needs and willingness of our teachers in further education.\r\nIn this application, we have planned 6 mobilities in details.  From all these mobilities we expect that our employees, among other things, will strengthen their language skills and gain valuable knowledge and experience from schools abroad. Primarily we will focus on teaching methods. We have planned 2 language courses for two weeks in Spain and 4 job-shadowing in England. We have 2 partner schools because even in Spain  while at the course the teachers will visit local schools. As partners we chose  very attractive schools, which have great success not only in their own countries. Teachers will be sent to different places and  courses to suit individual needs of our teachers and of our school. The project coordinator will become the mediator between our school and the organizations that organize suitable courses for teachers and between our partner schools for job-shading.\r\nThe coordinator of the project will monitor the whole process. An integral part of each mobility of our teachers will be a detailed evaluation report that teachers fill in upon their return. Our teachers have created and will subsequently update their Europass.\r\nWe expect that the impact of the project will be reflected in a higher qualitative level of teaching of our teachers and greater motivation. This impact is expected to take effect also on our pupils. We expect the effective involvement of a larger number of staff and students to work on European projects such as. etwinning projects, Erasmus plus KA2 or others.\r\nLong-term vision of our school is to streamline and improve education. E.g. increasing level in foreign language of language teachers will improve the teaching of a foreign language in our school. We want our teachers in the future to obtain the level of C1 of their language skills according to CEFR - Common European Framework for Languages.\r\nExperience of job-shadowing can help modernize teaching in the sense of connection between subjects and  involvement of modern technologies etc.\r\nWe expect more interest in other European countries and the subsequent studying abroad not only of teachers but also of our students, and this can lead to greater opportunities for young people in the labor market.\r\nAs an added value, we see substantial gains in the possibility of discussions with other European citizens in discovering different cultures and establishing international relations.\r\nWe are confident that we have carefully thought through a detailed strategic plan for the further education of our employees and that we have the right conditions for successful implementation of the project, which aims to significantly improve the skills of selected teachers.

It imparts classes for Pre \u2013 School and Primary Education. In the current academic year there are 175 pupils and 13 teachers registered.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, the Innovation and Development Plan was created aiming to cover certain necessities in our school. In a pedagogical level, the school was still following a traditional methodology, there was not a linguistic Programme and no International initiatives had yet been developed.\r\n\r\nThereby, key objectives were set under this Innovation Plan; the development of active strategies, based on group work and the use of ICT, the improvement of linguistic competences in English by students and the International development of the Institution.\r\n\r\nSome of the initiatives followed since then, have been, for example, the coordination of the first eTwinning project and the implementation of the Linguistic Programme.\r\n\r\nIn a second phase of the Innovation and Development Plan, it was assumed that these initiatives above had to be integrated in a more regular way throughout the didactic practices in all Primary courses. Parallel, the Linguistic Programme, now in its Second Level (June 2016), required a higher linguistic and methodological preparation in the part of the teachers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the aim was to obtain a KA1 Project (June 2016), which included three mobilities; one related to an \u201cInnovative Methodologies\u201d course and two mobilities related to a CLIL Methodology course. Nowadays, teachers are integrating these new gained knowledge through the development of cooperative projects and CLIL techniques. \r\n\r\nHowever, this methodological development has to continue. In the same way, this approach has to be supported by a development in an organizational level in order to make the current organization of teaching and learning more dynamic and consolidate the basis to guarantee the progress as a result. Therefore, there is a necessity to intervene in the organizational documents and adapt key objectives and main organizational elements to this new approach to see an integral change, both in a methodological and in an organizational way.\r\n\r\nParallel to this, it is difficult to understand the progress of our Institution without the continuous development of the Linguistic Project. This, necessarily, has to continue growing and therefore, the teachers\u00b4 training must continue to provide the necessary quality. \r\n\r\nIt is seen in the Erasmus + KA1 Programme, again, the opportunity for the teachers to be able to continue developing new knowledge and develop concrete actions to this currents circumstances as a result.\r\n\r\nConcretely, a Job Shadowing is to be undertaken in Blewbury Endowed Primary School, England.

A school with international experience, involved in active methodologies, an approach supported by all the professionals in the Institution. The participant will analyse organizational and methodological practices of the school to integrate these in our institution to achieve the change we are pursuing. \r\n\r\nAlso, two teachers will undertake an English course in Malta aiming to improve their English level and contribute to the development of the Linguistic Programme as a result.\r\n\r\nAfter the Job Shadowing, the participant will help the other teachers in his school to reform the Strategic Plan and other organizational documents of the Institution. Also, the Active Strategies Plan (current KA1) will duplicate the number of cooperative projects based on the ideas gathered out of his mobility. Together with this, a European Initiatives Plan based on the practices learnt in the English school will be also developed. Finally, a Job Shadowing programme will be design, based on the experience during of the participant\u00b4s mobility, to host other educative institutions that want to study our practices.\r\n\r\nAfter the formation on the English Language Course both teachers will contribute to improve the quality of the Linguistic Programme. Also, this will allow the incorporation of two new Subject Areas as a result of this experience.\r\n\r\nFinally, the students will benefit from the reform of the Strategic Plan of the Institution that will focus on a clearer and more structure plans.
