They are subject to a wide range of manmade pressures, with the result that many associated habitats and species deemed to be of importance at a European level have declined across their natural range.  Yet, compared to other habitat systems, relatively little is known about the ecological dynamics and requirements of rivers and the species that live in them.  This project focused on 7 pSCI rivers in different parts of the UK, totalling around 872 km.  Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera. They also represent a typical cross section of the different land uses, socio-economic users and threats associated with rivers in the UK, and indeed in the rest of Europe.\n\nThis LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. \n\nFirst, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.  Ultimately, the project aimed to develop techniques for addressing key issues associated with river conservation and demonstrate best practice which could then be widely disseminated within the UK and other Member States.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=550", null, "life_151"]]}}, "2PD": {"life": {"data": [[1997, "Atlantic Oakwoods - Restoration of Atlantic Oakwoods", "Caledonian Partnership, Highland Birchwoods Ltd", 2765725.0, 1382863.0, "Moss and lichen-rich old oak woodlands are an Annex I habitat type restricted to Britain and Ireland where this is the climax 'temperate rainforest' community of Europe's Atlantic coast. In Britain it is restricted to sites in the west of the country, many of which have been subject to management - including forestry practices - which have degraded their nature conservation interest. Underplanting and replacement of broadleaved deciduous species by exotic conifers; invasive plants like rhododendron; increasing pressure from deer browsing which reduces natural regeneration; and in some areas high visitor numbers, are among the key threats to these ancient oak woodlands.\n\nThe project was concerned with improving the habitat condition in seven of the most extensive Atlantic woodlands in Britain, ranging from Loch Maree in the far north-west of Scotland, through the popular Loch Lomond woodlands within easy reach of Glasgow, to Borrowdale woods in the Lake District and Meirionnydd oakwoods in north-west Wales. Together they cover nearly 4,900 ha of Atlantic oakwood habitat.\n\nAt each site, a set of management targets was to be established based on the most important perceived threats. Actions would target the clearance of around 690 ha of exotic conifers and broadleaves, treatment of around 405 ha to eradicate rhododendron, and treatment of a further area of over 370 ha to control bracken. Another important activity would be controlling grazing - particularly by sheep, deer and feral goats through a mixture of stock fencing - over 60 km - and deer culling. The effectiveness of the various measures was to be monitored and assessed and the results disseminated on a web-site.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=251", null, "life_34"]]}}}}
