The changing sociopolitical situation in contemporary Europe brings many new problems related immediately to the practice of (future) social workers \u2013 migration crisis, cultural and religious plurality, xenophoby, poverty and social exclusion. It also brings, on the other hand, efforts to include disadvantage persons, to treat people justly and equally, to respect human rights and dignity and to educate toward tolerance.\r\n\r\nIf we want to provide our students with quality education applicable in practical life, we cannot do without interns in countries in which abovementioned goals have been top social priorities much longer than in the Czech Republic.- Great Britain and Germany.  Institutions which we chose as foreign partners are known to accentuate aspects of social work that we find important (e.g. inclusion of disadvantaged persons, human dignity, empowerment, respect to otherness). The aim of the project is to enable students to stay 3 or 4 weeks in these institutions and to undergo professional training which would subsequently be reflected upon and used in real life. \r\n\r\nFurthemore, we expect the students to gain a notion of social and cultural climate of the host country. In confrontation with the abovementioned topics, many a young person in the Czech Republic is embarassed and under the influence of various ideological and populist cliches. All partner institutions are excellent examples of how to deal with all these problems effectively.\r\n\r\nAn improved command of a foreign language is also an important aspect of the interns. The students have undergone special theoretical training in this area, which it is necessary to bring into practice of real life communication with clients. Especially the German labor market in social work area is stiill undersaturated and open to Czech workers, which brings our students the opportunity to join foreign teams.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, personality development of our students is an important, however unmeasurable, goal of the intended activities. A foreign stay will make our students more self-reliant and confident, they will learn how to assess a situation and how to react to it, they can be inspired by positive impulses in foreign countries and critically assess social work there and perhaps appreciate practice in this country.\r\n\r\nPractice will be attended by a total of 18 students of the 2nd and 3rd years, with theoretical and practical foundations in their field of study who underwent a careful selection and vetting process. The placement will last for 3-4 weeks; one internship will be attended by 1 \u2013 2 students. Trainees will be gradually involved in the work of a foreign team, first as observers and auditors, later as workers responsible for carrying out particular tasks.work. All will be supervised and students if needed will be provided assistance to.\r\n\r\nIn terms of methodology placements have their important preparatory phase (professional, methodical, intercultural, and language training) as well as subsequent phase (evaluation, a report from the placement, reflection, supervision, and presentations at various forums).\r\n\r\nExperience from abroad will be used in students\u00b4 future professional life in different types of social institutions. Observing professional trends and the transfer of international experience is a valuable opportunity to raise the quality of social work in our country. The impact of mobility can be seen not only in purely practical professional knowledge, but also in the approach to issues of human values (and the value of a human being) in helping professions.\r\n\r\nBy working out professional portfolio and using Europass could facilitate our graduates their access to the European labour market.", "http://www.larchelondon.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-CZ01-KA102-035126_1"]]}}}}
