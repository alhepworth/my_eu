Delivering programmes to a number of secondary schools and colleges across the province, we provide a pathway to further and higher education, scholarships and jobs within the sports/football industry. FMC is now at the forefront of sports/education VET provision throughout NI. \r\n\r\nThe FMC are making application to take 23 students and 4 accompanying staff/ tutors for vocational educational training to Portugal, to enhance learner development with the intention of up-skilling students and improving the employability/ career prospects and competitiveness of learners in alignment with the BTEC course curriculum. A third of participants will be females which supports their inclusion in a predominantly male dominated sport.\r\n\r\nPortugal was selected as the national team are ranked 3rd in the FIFA/ Coca Cola World ranking's (NI has dropped to 25th) and as such are a world class producer of talented players resulting from the use of best practice coaching methods in terms of technical and tactical training and play. The selection of a partner in Portugal was deemed to optimise both the learning opportunities of the students and to give maximum credibility to the mobility whereby the learners would be able to observe best practice from a leading football nation.\r\n\r\nBrowns was selected as a partner because they are an experienced host of Erasmus+ mobility programmes which was deemed to benefit the FMC's first mobility project. Importantly Brown's have great contacts with a range of top clubs in Portugal (including SC Farense & SC Olhanese) who have strong youth development strands and excellent Academy structures. These Portuguese clubs have developed strong links with community programmes, which is of particular interest to the FMC who also deliver community coaching initiatives. \r\n\r\nThe participants will all be students of the Football Education Academy who have a desire to progress to a playing, coaching or development role in the Sports/Football Industry. The \u2018Football Coaching & Education Academy\u2019 offers 16-18 year olds (Post 16 students) a full time course of study that provides both the theoretical and practical background, academic qualification, specialist professional training and unique playing and job placement opportunities with some of the leading recruiters of talent in NI.\r\n\r\nStudents of the Academy are undertaking a BTEC Extended Sports Diploma (Coaching & Performance). This qualification is equivalent to 3 A-Levels and students can attain 48-168 UCAS Points (New Tariff). It is a mix of both theoretical and practical knowledge and is recognised for entry to Further Education and University.\r\n\r\nThis programme is the perfect platform to benefit those participants who come from areas of targeted social need (TSN) as classified by the NI Statistics Research Agency in 2010 and to educate them not only in developing their communication, both oral and written, social and self-awareness skills but in enabling them to improve their chances of employment, enhanced career progression and long term job security, in football as a result of this Mobility.\r\n\r\nThe mobility will be effectively planned, organised, monitored and evaluated by the Mobility Organising Committtee to ensure that all established learning outcomes are achieved. Key to the evaluation process will be school based target/achievements level assessment methods undertaken by FMC tutors together with results of pre & post mobility psychometric assessments of ability, achievement and social aptitude.  All feedback from the participants, partners and management team will be collated and used to improve any future mobility undertaken. \r\n\r\nThe FMC is committed to fully and widely disseminating the mobility objectives and outcomes upon its completion across the club, its partner organisation and with other stakeholders including:- 3 Regional Education Centres - Hanwood Centre, Dundonald - Poleglass Community Centre, Sally Gardens - Laurelhill Community College, Irish FA (NI National Governing Body), Sport NI, Department of Culture Arts & Leisure & scholarship partners, Pass4Soccer and First Point USA which will widely promote the Erasmus+ programme across NI & beyond. \r\n\r\nFor a period of 3 years post-mobility FMC will undertake to track each students\u2019s pathway by reviewing and evaluating their progress on an annual basis.  This will establish key data and trends from the direct relationship between a successful European mobility and improved employability.  Similarly, FMC will measure, review and analyse its own VET delivery re number of students achieving or excelling against predicted grades to ascertain the impact on the Coaching & Education Academy academic results.", "http://www.footballmanagementcompany.com", "Football Management Company (NI) Ltd", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047437_coordinator"]]}}, "0QL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Bridging the Gap: world of school-world of work", "Colorite Europe Ltd.", 150866.0, 5, 26, "The project plays an important role in the acquisition of technical and professional skills.

to fulfill the provisions of the promoter internationalization strategy and specifically reaffirms its desire to pursue the following objectives:-to improve the quality of academic programs through international internship that will allow all students completing their education successfully preventing dropouts, and enhancing the potential of each one with an eye for young foreigners and even to people with fewer opportunities or with disabilities.-Improving access to employment by equipping their students of appropriate skills to undertake and capable of innovation and proactiveness in both local and international working contexts.-Improving the certification of competences and above all transversal skills or soft skills, like essential heritage to enter into labour market or to continue University studies.The three objectives will be achieved thanks to the implementation of the project and the enhancement of international experiences in the training courses of the Promoter.-Improve and enhance the use of new technologies by creating online forms for students. This objective will be attained through the ability for participants to participate on OLS platform to improve their language skills, in pre-departure phase.-Improve the quality of training and updating of teachers in order to improve the services and quality standards, thanks to their participation in the international experience as accompanying persons.-Improve and enhance the actions of vocational guidance for students, through synergies with external resources as well as services to local jobs. This aim will be achieved thanks to the work of preparation before departure, evaluation and certification of claims upon return.The GAP Month project envisages, in line with what was planned in the VET card request, and in line with the experiences of managing international mobility projects from 1996 to 2014, to allow 20 students in classes IV and V to 35 days international internship experience (+ 2 travel days) in Spain and in Northern Ireland.As a new element, in line with the provisions of the internationalization plan (page 7), the promoter aims to expand the opportunities of an international mobility experience to all students of the pole itself, involving all professionals profiles. In 2015, during the preparation phase of such a project proposal, the team in charge of the \"internationalisation paths\" have organised training courses for teachers on the internationalisation of the training offers, to make them aware of the importance of international internships.Students from logistics, captains and machinists sector, from mechanical, electronic and electro technical sector and even those from construction sector and surveyors will benefit from the project.Hosting companies have already mentioned possible areas of performances and LO for all target groups (see point C).The main actions of the project will be in line with the project management rules, already tested in the past by the Nautical Institute:-signature of the MOU with the host institutions for different professionals (captains and machinists, mechanics, electrical and electronic technicians, surveyors)-information and selection of candidates through analysis of European CV, cover letter and interview.

In recent years we feel that children with SEN is on the increase and we feel that by creating an SEN unit and outdoor education facility we can cater better for their individual needs. We will continue our partnership with the Middletown Centre throughout our project and beyond. Having gained valuable insight into European culture through e-Twinning, we now feel confident in developing our own skills and methodologies. Through working with Middletown we have gained invaluable experience and knowledge. However we have lots more to learn through this partnership.  Since completing their training course and working with them as a partner we feel we\u2019re ready to progress to the next level of SEN. We as a staff believe that training and job-shadowing in Europe will be the best motivation staff and pupils will have in implementing the new Action Plan in regards to SEN, outdoor education.The objectives of our project are to:* Develop training and new methodologies in teaching and learning and transfer them to our own school*To exchange ideas of International and European best practice in SEN and develop links with teachers from other countries*To build a classroom community that promotes inclusion for all children and which provides opportunities for independence*To learn different approaches to education and learning outdoors, and gain training in using practical      tasks carried out in the outdoors*To learn about the local community as a resource to support outdoor education*To promote learning, social inclusion and communication skills through outdoor play *To develop staff competencies in using ICT as a tool in SEN*To understand and implement e-safety and promote the use of iPads and tablets, enabling remote access learning in our school*To develop our teaching methodologies in promoting our national language in a setting which is becoming increasingly bilingual. *To raise achievements , develop suitable resources and provide equal learning opportunities for all pupilsThe whole school staff will be involved in this project.We have 6 full time teachers and 1 part-time teacher on our staff. We also want to include our ancillary staff in these mobilities and training, as they will be instrumental in the implementation and success of this project.Staff members (10 in total) have varying levels of competencies in SEN. Our aim is to make sure that no staff member will feel left behind or inadequate in the teaching and learning of children with SEN. Thus, we have chosen staff training courses of different levels of ability and challenge, to suit the needs of all our staff. Combined, these courses will help diffuse the challenges we face in teaching children with SEN and promote the attainment of the aims and objectives of the project.Methodology:We want to identify the best way that our school can set up an SEN unit and an outdoor education facility so all pupils are provided with a socially integrated, learning environment.We would like to answer the following questions:Is the setting up of an outdoor education facility and a unit that will cater for children with SEN within our grasp and will it benefit all pupils?Will outdoor education and SEN training enhance our teaching?How can International Policy and best practice help us achieve our vision? Will staff e-confidence help promote an e-learning culture within our school?We will use a combination of qualitative and quantitative data to guide our approach.We hope to use descriptive research methodology along with staff, pupil and parent questionnaires during the life of the project. Random sampling of teachers and pupils will be used to obtain a representative sample of attitudes towards our project.Pupils will be given opportunities to learn in a healthy, safe environment. They will experience new skills and methodologies that we as a staff learn through our training.  We hope to promote their learning in outdoor education which will assist all children to express themselves in a different way.Once the training and job-shadowing have been completed, we expect the results to be very positive. We expect this project to have a great impact on our staff, pupils and wider school community. We hope to be a school at the forefront of SEN and outdoor education in our county, and to encourage them to incorporate our newly learned teaching styles and methodologies into their schools. This project will incorporate an important international element that will make us feel less cut-off from our neighbouring counterparts and  integrate us better with our European partners, through training, networking and face to face encounters.
