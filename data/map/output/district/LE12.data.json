It is often referred to as the universal soil conditioner for its benefits to the soil. The decayed\nand dried sphagnum peat moss is usually referred to as simply peat. As a soil amendment, it is free of weed seeds, pests\nand pathogens and can absorb up to 20 times its weight in water. The peat bogs from which peat moss is derived are one of\nthe most distinctive kinds of wetlands. Peat bogs are an important environmental resource and create areas of huge\nbiodiversity, keeping more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than forests, and helping to prevent flooding. Problem:\nNaturally formed peat has been harvested for centuries, and European supplies are seriously depleted in England, Holland\nand Germany, and are in the process of being commercially harvested in areas of Eastern Europe. This harvesting causes\nserious environmental problems, as the peat cannot be regenerated within our lifetimes. Habitats are destroyed, and the\ncarbon balance is badly affected, as peatlands are major stores of carbon and are vital environmental \u2018regulators\u2019. Many\npeatlands globally, which have been farmed for peat, are now sources of greenhouse gases, owing to degradation and\noxidation of the unsaturated peat layer. The UK government are currently working to completely phase out the use of peat\nbased products in UK Horticulture by 2030, but there is presently no viable alternative growing media which offers the same\nquality as peat.\nThis project is to determine the business opportunity for the commercialisation of a method to grow moss on a large scale,\non mats, which will speed up significantly the growing process, enabling the production of a sustainable growing media for\nhorticulture (replacing peat) and creating a valuable cash crop opportunity for farmers.", 44536.0, 63623.0, 1, 1, "MataMoss", null, null, null, "h2020_211679_918641217"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "MICROPROPAGATION SERVICES (E.M.)

The fibre produced will be of much higher quality, without the physical damage caused by mechanical decortication, circumventing reliance on unpredictable weather for completion of dew retting in fields. Chemical treatments have been used to modify fibres to improve matrix to fibre adhesion in composite materials. However, these chemical treatments use hazardous materials, are time-consuming and create a significant level of waste. Therefore, a treatment process that does not pose a threat to the natural environment and that is reproducible, whilst creating little or no hazardous waste, would be extremely advantageous.

Engaging closely with end-users during the development of its Intellicone\u00ae technology platform it became apparent that there is a major need for flexible technologies that can help improve safety as well as improve operational efficiency on temporary worksites. These worksites exist in highway maintenance and major infrastructure construction. In order to mimise disruption these are often confined and continuously changing. As a result it is a challenging to avoid potential harm to workers on foot by moving plant or to prevent high vehicles from hitting over head structures and cables. In order to remain competitive Europe needs to maintain and improve its transport infrastructure. However, as there is limited scope for new roads and railways, there is an increasing pressure on national governments to maximise the capacity of their existing networks to achieve infrastructure upgrades and renewals. SmartSite will provide a technology solution that is easy to use and scalable. It will help the construction industry improve site safety whilst enabling safer interaction between personnel on foot and moving plant.

Despite stringent health & safety standards over 50% of UK road workers reported a near miss with a vehicle and the large majority of injuries or fatalities occur within designated safety areas. These safe zones are either protected by positive protection systems such as concrete barriers or soft barriers such as traffic cones. The latter are mainly used for temporary works. In such a scenario cones may be the only protection a road worker has from traffic. Due to the maturity of Europe\u2019s road network and the rapid deterioration as a result of heavy traffic and weather conditions, temporary road work is increasing. In addition to concerns about safety, preparation of these temporary barriers is a major drain on resources. As a lot of roadwork is carried out at night, barriers are equipped with lanterns. These are typically powered by disposable batteries which only last a short period of time and have to be changed frequently. The Safelane consortium have successfully developed  a wireless perimeter protection system that detects an impact to a temporary barrier. However,  there are several significant technical hurdles that currently prevent the development of a system that can be applied to every road maintenance scenario. In Safelane we propose to develop an all-encompassing system including; a Smart re-chargeable lantern battery with integrated wireless impact sensor; a Smart alarm base station capable of receiving alerts from individual impact sensors, to warn the workforce; and a device management system enabling road maintenance contractors to effectively manage temporary work sites via a web based graphical user interface.
