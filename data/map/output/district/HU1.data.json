OLAE potentially offers a giant step for consumer electronics and will continue to address mass market applications. In this OLAE field, Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) has to compete with Si and Thin Film PV. OPV has followed this tremendous growth and makes important additions to the motivation: low cost and easy manufacturing on flexible substrates by printing technologies. The problem of harvesting energy from light naturally presents a large area challenge and no manufacturing technique is faster than printing and coating under ambient conditions in terms of manufactured surface per unit time. This is in reality what gives OPV the competitive advantage over all other PV technologies.Power conversion efficiency of OPV cells has relatively been growing \\0.5% per year from 1990. This enhancement is mainly due to new performing material discovery. If we want to reach relative growth up to 1 to 2% per year, we still have to work on new high absorbing polymers but also put great effort on device architecture design like the tandem structure. Novel disruptive concepts are required involving cheaper production of multilayered printed cells based on innovative engineered architectures (R2R printed tandem cell), new high performance materials (low band gap Eg ~1.5 eV, electrodes, high performance interface, barrier adhesive). Such innovative solutions are necessary for the technology to reach further than today's niche markets and to overcome the limitations by improving at least two times the currently achieved efficiency (12%), improving the lifetime by more than factor 4 from today's known OPV cell and reducing the cost (down to 0.7\u20ac/Wp).

The GRACE project will recruit, employ and provide advanced training for 15 ESRs who will research the production of cultures of gender equality across five specific sites where cultures of gender equalities are produced and contested by differently situated social agents. These five sites form the core of our research and training Work Packages, and are focused as follows: mediated cultures of gender equality (WP 1); urban cultures of gender equality (WP 2); intellectual and activist cultures of gender equality (WP 3); textual and artistic cultures of gender equality (WP 4); employing cultures of gender equality (WP 5). In sum, GRACE is designed to: equip the next generation of ESRs to play a leading role in developing advanced techniques for investigating the production of cultures of gender equality; translate creative and critical capacities into innovative cultural practices within and beyond academia; and enable them to take up positions as experts in producing new gender equalities cultures.", null, 3154417.0, 6, 10, "GRACE", null, null, null, "h2020_198287_990156019"], [1514764800000, 1640908800000, "CiRcular Economy: SusTainability Implications and guidING progress", "Kingston Upon Hull City Council", "CRESTING will train Early Stage Researchers (ESR) in cutting edge systematic analysis of the process of transformation to a Circular Economy (CE). Establishing a CE (such that the maximum value is extracted from materials and waste generation minimised) is a major policy area within the European Union and elsewhere.  Explicitly seen as increasing economic competitiveness and laying a foundation for environmental employment, CE policies are designed to increase resource efficiency and decrease carbon dependency. Previous and ongoing research into the CE, however, has been largely concerned with strategies for implementation.  The many different fields of activity comprising the CE (e.g., re-use, recovery, recycling, eco-design amongst others)    operate with varying degrees of effectiveness in different places and for different materials.  These fields of activity have not been critically analysed as an interrelated social, technical, environmental and, significantly, spatial phenomenon.  This programme will advance the critical analysis of the concept and sustainability implications of the CE by the training of 15 ESR analysing CE-related activity and initiatives in a range of geographic and economic settings.  CRESTING is divided between 5 work packages (WP) analysing: current discourse and policy contexts (WP1); corporate engagement with the CE (WP2); public sector engagement in the CE (WP3); the potential for local economic development and employment from the CE (WP4); and measuring life cycle impacts and developing sustainability indicators relevant to the CE (WP5).
