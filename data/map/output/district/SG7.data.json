Prior to departure, the participant will undertake private study and identify gaps in their subject knowledge, which they intend to focus on addressing during the course.  Following their return to the UK, they will undertake two twilight training sessions for colleagues to disseminate cultural knowledge developed during their stay and teaching methods/ideas/strategies acquired during their visit.\r\n\r\nThe participant will be expected to improve their level of fluency in spoken German, their understanding and application of grammatical rules and their knowledge and understanding of idiomatic expression.  Their linguistic competence will be assessed at the start and end of the course.  In addition to language skills, they will be expected to acquire new teaching methods, which can be shared with fellow teachers of both German and other European languages within the faculty.  During their stay in Berlin, they will be expected to acquire resources, which could be used within the faculty to enhance pupils' learning about German language, society and culture in the longer term.", "http://ktemplar.herts.sch.uk", "The Knights Templar School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001994_coordinator"]]}}, "6EZ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Embodying Empowerment: Innovating Pedagogy for the Margins", "Reboot The Roots", 50798.0, 2, 2, "Since 2008 Reboot the Roots has focused adult education into a raft of educational programmes and trainings aimed at disadvantaged and marginalised learners, both in the UK and abroad. Inspired by the work of Augusto Boal, our educational work explores the interface between theatre, creativity and education. We believe that creative tools for social transformation can end alienation and exclusion, enabling people to participate fully and equally in society.\r\n\r\nIn the UK we have established a strong track record of empowering and inclusive education, especially engaging with homeless people, LGBT communities, refugees and stateless people, as well as people recovering from addiction. Our key area of competence is in the popular education form know as Theatre of the Oppressed, created by Augusto Boal. \r\n\r\nWe now want to increase our capacity to support diverse groups of learners from the groups mentioned above. In order to achieve this, we will need to develop new and innovative curricula and trainings which integrate a wider and more diverse range of participatory pedagogies. At the same time, we seek to build long term relationships with compatible training organisations and educators in Europe, especially seeking to increase our competence to work in a pan-european setting.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, we have approached a training organisation who focus on high quality education towards building capacity within European civil society, promoting inclusivity, pluralism and socially just transformation. In collaboration with the partner organisation we have designed a series of training mobilities and teaching assignments. These will see 6 key members of staff joining training teams in the design and delivery of courses combining the relevant methodologies. A further 15 of our teaching staff will take part in structured trainings.\r\n\r\nThese activities will enable a critical number of our staff to gain competence in innovative methods and tools related to participatory and learner-centred education. Specifically, our staff will learn skills and approaches related to embodied and somatic-based education, methods for integrating a range of arts-based educational tools, and practices for creating learning environments which can most effectively empower and equip disadvantaged and marginalised learners.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen trainings in methods proven to be effective in creating inclusive and empowering learning opportunities that can enhance people\u2019s capacity to live meaningful lives as healthy and valued members of society. They are chosen because they can support people to find the confidence, courage and skills to challenge social structures, prejudices and practices that contribute to their exclusion and marginalisation. \r\n\r\nSomatic-based educational practices can be understood as reflective processes of undoing existing patterns so that new ones can emerge. This transdisciplinary approach seeks to contribute to an alternative social imagery and world-making. The incorporation of visual and audio arts based practices is especially well suited to the engagement of diverse learner groups. Together these methods will augment our organisational capacity to realise strategic objectives related to inclusive and empowering education.\r\nThe project will bring Reboot the Roots crucial learning concerning innovative approaches and best practice being developed in the sector in Europe. \r\n\r\nThe teaching assignments will equip senior staff to champion the integration of these approaches within Reboots current repertoire. They will gain experience of the challenges of designing and delivering trainings that integrate a blend of participatory methodologies. At the same time, they will be enabled to share some of our expertise and build a meaningful relationship with the partner organisation. \r\n\r\nThis collaboration will substantiate our relationship with professional educators in Europe, while exposing our staff to a wide network of EU based trainers and their organisations. We will learn from trainers with extensive experience of pan-european settings. We hope that this will increase our capacity and opportunities to work at a European level. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important impact of this project will be the increased range and quality of educational provision aimed at disadvantaged and marginalised groups (the homeless learners, LGBTQ communities, stateless people, refugees, and the people recovering from addiction that we work with). They will become more able to strengthen their support networks, advocate for themselves and each other, meet and transform the challenges of discrimination and intolerance, gain confidence and capacity in taking their rightful place in society, and make improvements in their economic and other material conditions. This empowerment of disadvantaged and marginalised groups will lead to impacts on the wider community, promoting a more inclusive, tolerant, and pluralistic European society.", "http://www.reboottheroots.org.uk", "Reboot The Roots", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA104-046926_coordinator"]]}}}}
