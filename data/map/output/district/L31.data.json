Adults should know your rights and help you learn about them too.\u201d Article 42, UN Convention on the Rights of the Child \u2013 (In Child Friendly Language)\r\n\u201cMy Rights\u2026.My Responsibilities\u201d (MRMR) is an international project based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). It aims to raise the profile of the CRC amongst the 6 schools involved, so that the values enshrined within them become embedded in the culture of each school.  It will address Article 42, quoted above, which states that every child should be taught about their rights.\r\nThe CRC agenda is very high within the European Union (EU), & all EU legislation linked to children is underpinned by these rights. As the UK distances itself from the EU, & the EU itself faces new challenges, we believe that now more than ever it is of vital importance to use projects such as these to develop cross-cultural links & forge strong relationships with each other so that children develop tolerance and understanding of others.  \r\nMRMR involves primary schools from UK, Poland, Spain, Greece, Romania & Italy. Amongst these countries, through UNICEF\u2019s Rights Respecting Schools (RRS) Programme, the UK is at the forefront of thinking about Children\u2019s Rights. The others, whilst recognizing the importance of them, have thus far done little to address them. The UK school is committed to RRS & is keen to both share its learning, & develop new methods & thinking about CRC with its partners.  The project is directed mainly at pupils from 9-12 years old & will involve small teams in each school as drivers of the project, but also whole classes & whole schools.\r\nThe main objectives of the project are: to develop knowledge & understanding of the CRC, relating this to everyday lives; to develop pupil civic, cultural and interpersonal competences; to involve pupils in democratic processes, develop their critical thinking & sense of responsibility regarding rights; to exchange good practice, share experience & knowledge with partners in Europe, particularly in relation to rights & responsibilities in school, & in terms of developing ICT competencies; to develop pupils\u2019 knowledge about crucial matters of health & well-being, both now and in the future; to improve language skills through a holistic approach & to promote entrepreneurship education.\r\nIn order to achieve our objectives we have designed a programme which spans two years & five modules. The Modules each focus on a separate area of Rights and Responsibilities (R&R) and include a focus on different Articles from the CRC as follows: \r\n1. All About Me! \u2013 R&R towards ourselves (Articles 7,8 + 30); \r\n2. It\u2019s a Small World \u2013 R&R regarding the environment (Article 29);\r\n3. Five A Day \u2013 R&R regarding health (Article 30);\r\n4. Thinking Outside the Box \u2013 R&R in the classroom (Article  2, 17 + 28)\r\n5. Ahead of the Game \u2013 R&R in the playground (Articles  23 + 31)\r\nEach module will be led by one of the countries, & include a mobility hosted there. This school has some expertise in the area to be explored. Greece, for example, will host the mobility in Module 4, having a particular expertise in integrating a migrant population into classrooms. We believe that mobilities are essential in order to develop strong relationships and trust between the countries, & in order to develop our learning. \r\nFor each Module we will develop innovative teaching & learning methods, focusing both on the Rights involved, & the Responsibilities that we have in relation to these Rights. For example, in Module 3 we will look at a child\u2019s right to nutritious food, & discuss the importance of each individual making sensible choices regarding this right. \r\nDuring each module, participants will carry out project work in their own schools relating to a particular topic. They will use video, blogs, e-mail & e-Twinning TwinSpace to co-operate with partners & strengthen links between the pupils & schools. A representative group from each school will then participate in a mobility where learning will be shared. During the mobility there will be an opportunity to develop ideas about the next Article so that participants can take back & continue the work on it at school. Then the cycle will continue.\r\nWhere CRC education is most successful it results in very positive relationships in schools, a decrease in incidences of bullying, a culture of respect and tolerance & a very positive attitude to diversity.  Pupils are pro-active in their learning & in the life of the school, taking a meaningful role in decision making. They develop an understanding of local & global issues and make a positive contribution to address these.  We hope that the project will take us some way towards these outcomes.\r\nBy involving school leaders & the whole school community in the project, we hope to leave a lasting impact whereby schools embrace the CRC & strive to build its values of equality, democracy, respect & individual freedoms into their culture.", "http://www.summerhillprimary.com", "Summerhill Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036528_coordinator"], [2016, "Spanish Springs at Summerhill (SSS)", "Summerhill Primary School", 23583.0, 1, 1, "The 'Spanish Springs in Summerhill' (SSS) Project is designed to build Summerhill Primary School's capacity to teach Spanish and to  enhance our profile as a truly European school.We are a small, one-form entry community primary school in the suburbs of Liverpool with a large staff due to high numbers of children with complex special needs.

We have since developed our relationship with the Polish school, hosting them twice in England and sending  six more staff to learn from them in Poland. This has had a huge impact on the development of the school as well as on individual staff. The SSS Project builds on the learning from the Partners In Poland Project and will take us to a new level in becoming an international school.We have set out a three year (2015 - 2018) European School Development Plan which encompasses our vision for the immediate future. Through the SSS project we aim to take significant steps towards fulfilling three of the main aspirations in this plan. Specifically, through the project we want to build capacity to develop and deliver a quality Modern Foreign Language programme, and also to promote staff well-being in order to maintain a strong professional profile. A longer term aim is to provide pupils with opportunities to deepen their knowledge and understanding of Spanish, and this we hope to fully achieve by organising pupil mobilities in a later project.The main activity funded by Erasmus+ will be structured training courses for Summerhill staff in Spain. Two groups of about seven, comprising both teaching and non-teaching staff, will commit part of their alloted school holidays to the week long training courses, which will be selected for their capacity to develop personal Spanish language skills AND Spanish teaching skills. Meanwhile, the school curriculum will be adjusted to include Spanish Language learning in Reception, Y1 and Y2 as well as in the Juniors, and all classes will be involved in making links with Spanish schools through eTwinning. The SSS Project will be led and managed by an Erasmus+ Management Group (E+MG) comprising a Governor, Headteacher, Languages Co-ordinator (who teaches in KS1) and the KS2 leader.

We also expect it to develop staff pedagogical knowledge so that they return with a clearer understanding of how to teach Spanish and how to respond to the needs of individual children in this subject.We know from previous experience with the PIP project that staff will also develop personally in terms of confidence and inter-personal skills, giving them improved capacity for promotion and greater job-satisfaction. From the excitement of learning a new language they may well see the benefits of lifelong learning and be enthused to seek and take other opportunities as they arise.Pupils will benefit from the project as their Language curriculum is dramatically improved and the school becomes bi-lingual in its approach. In the long term they will benefit from being involved in mobilities to Spain themselves and as generations of pupils receive an excellent languages education they will contribute to a more cohesive society and a more skilled and internationalised workforce.

During the week they will develop their confidence and improve their teaching expertise by teaching lessons to English classes. They will also job-shadow Spanish teachers in order to observe their methods and curriculum content so that they can gain a greater insight into the Spanish education system. Participants will also engage in cultural activities in order to gather resources and knowledge to add to the Spanish Curriculum at Summerhill.
