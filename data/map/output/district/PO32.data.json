Following the trade study, a review and downselect of concepts to be manufactured as small scale feature demonstrators would happen in conjuction with outputs from the Airbus Preliminary Design Review of the Short Range Aircraft concept. An assembled test rig will be constructed and the small scale demonstrators would be subject to testing and evaluation. A final report identifying the test outputs against the target requirements will be delivered at the conclusion of this programme. After the successful conclusion of this bid, GKN Aerospace would like to continue to R&amp;amp;T in this area as the Natural Laminar Flow Wing is recognized as a potential key technology for the next generation of aircrafts. The UK National Aerospace Technology Strategy (NATS) has also identified the Laminar Flow Wing Box Validation Programme therefore giving further opportunities for collaboration in the future.", 107303.0, 214607.0, 1, 1, "GKN GBSSD", null, "http://www.aerospace.gknplc.com", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58513.jpg", "fp7_100897_997381161"], [1380585600000, 1425081600000, "Innovative aircraft ice protection system \u2013 sensing and modelling", "GKN Aerospace Services Limited", "The overall aim of this project is a novel approach for increased sensitivity of laminar wings to ice accretion in all flight phase.

The project consortium is composed by forty European partners from fifteen countries. The work has been broken down into seven work packages. The AFLoNext concept is based on six Technology Streams:\n\n(1) Hybrid Laminar Flow technology applied on fin and wing for friction drag reduction.\n(2) Flow control technologies applied on outer wing for performance increase.\n(3) Technologies for local flow separation control applied in wing/pylon junction to improve the performance and loads situation mainly during take-off and landing.\n(4) Technologies to control the flow conditions on wing trailing edges thereby improving the performance and loads situation in the whole operational domain.\n(5) Technologies to mitigate airframe noise during landing generated on flap and undercarriage and through mutual interaction.\n(6) Technologies to mitigate/control vibrations in the undercarriage area during take-off and landing.\n\nAFLoNext aims to prove the engineering feasibility of the HLFC technology for drag reduction on fin in flight test and on wing by means of large scale testing as well as for vibrations mitigation technologies for reduced aircraft weight and for noise mitigation technologies.\n\nThe peculiarity of the AFLoNext proposal in terms of holistic technical approach and efficient use of resources becomes obvious through the joint use of a flight test aircraft as common test platform for the above mentioned technologies.\n\nTo improve aircraft performance locally applied active flow control technologies on wing and wing/pylon junction are qualified in wind tunnels or by means of lab-type demonstrators.", 40814.0, 30332387.0, 15, 41, "AFLONEXT", null, "http://www.aerospace.gknplc.com", null, "fp7_109010_997381161"]]}}}}
