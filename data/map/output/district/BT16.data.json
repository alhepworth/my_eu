Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is the reference standard for the diagnosis of CAD and allows immediate therapy. However, only 40% of patients undergoing ICA actually have obstructive CAD and ICA has relatively rare but considerable risks. Coronary computed tomography (CT) is the most accurate diagnostic test for CAD currently available. CT may become the most effective strategy to reduce the ca. 2 million annual negative ICAs in Europe by enabling early and safe discharge of the majority of patients with an intermediate risk of CAD.\nTo evaluate this, we propose the DISCHARGE project that will be implemented by a multinational European consortium. The core of the project is the DISCHARGE pragmatic randomised controlled trial. The primary hypothesis will be that CT is superior to ICA for major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) after a maximum follow-up of 4 years in a selected broad population of stable chest pain patients with intermediate pretest likelihood of CAD. The trial will include 25 clinical sites from 16 European countries ensuring broad geographical representation. Comparative effectiveness research of complementing work packages include gender-related analysis, systematic review of evidence, cost-effectiveness analysis, and health-related quality of life.

What stifles the development of new educational interventions, in many cases, is the unpreparedness, even reluctance, of educators to engage in new environments that undermine their perceived role as educators. There are now a wide range of ubiquitous learning environments that are accessible and user-friendly and offer potential learning opportunities for marginalised groups that are attractive and engaging. In this evolving education landscape the old 'sage-on-the-stage' model of institutional based provision is no longer the only educational act in town.\r\n\r\nAdult and community education programmes, free from the shackles of institution based provision, are often places where real educational innovation takes place. These programmes differ significantly from formal education and according to the Eurydice Report in 2014 \"adults are much more likely to participate in non-formal learning activities than in formal education and training...the take-up of non-formal education and training is nearly six times higher compared to formal education\". There is a significant lack of appropriate in-service training to support the CPD of educators and nowhere is this more apparent than in the adult and community education sector which is traditionally the poor relation where investment in CPD is concerned. \r\n\r\nAlthough there has been significant progress in the last 5 years ESL remains a significant problem in many Member States. Research shows that the prospects for early school-leavers throughout the remainder of their lives are bleak.

Although these rates show a decline from the  highs of 2011 they are still way above the overall unemployment rates in all countries and are evidence of the continuing impact that the economic crisis is having on young adults in Europe.\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship drives innovation, competitiveness, job creation and growth.  It allows new innovative ideas turn into successful ventures and can unlock the personal potential of individuals. Research shows that Europe does not exploit its entrepreneurial potential with Americans involved in three times more new entrepreneurial ventures than their European counterparts (Eurostat).\r\nThe critical role played by start-ups and young businesses in driving economic development and job creation is increasingly understood. Across the OECD area SMEs account for approximately 99% of all enterprises and two-thirds of employment. SMEs account for 57% of GDP in Europe. They are the \u2018engine room\u2019 of the EU economy. 95% of all SMEs are in fact micro-enterprises, traditionally the seeding ground for new entrepreneurs and this is especially so in the creative sector where most new businesses employ on average 2 or 3 people. The \u201cEuropean Competitiveness Report 2010\u201d, referred to the \u201ctransforming role\u201d of the creative industries for the future of the EU economy.\r\n\r\nThe perception of creative businesses held by many financiers is that they are run by individuals with passion; that many are lifestyle businesses with low growth or scalable potential; that they rely on \u201cflakey\u201d business models; produce products and services that have no protect-able intellectual property; are very difficult to value; and are characterised by poor marketing and poor management skills. To counteract this the proposed new curriculum will include modules that address how to; \r\na) present the creative entrepreneur and his/her management team; b) outline the investment opportunity that the new business presents; c) demonstrate that the proposed business model is relevant and fit-for-purpose; d) present the scalability of your creative product or idea and a true market valuation; e) protect intellectual property\r\n\r\nIn Europe, creative industries build upon a rich and diverse core of cultural heritage and skillful arts.

While everyone wants to be healthy there is a strong connection between income levels and where you live with your health and life expectancy. The rising costs of health care, including for diseases that could actually be prevented or better managed means that societies and economies have an interest in promoting better health. To be and to stay physically and mentally healthy is linked to knowledge about living a healthy life at all stages. Central to achieving this is having access to health care and understanding health information. Health literacy is a basic competence and needs to be recognised as such. \r\n\r\nHealth literacy is the capacity of people to access, understand and apply information, so that they can make informed choices related to their health. In a Report by the European Health Forum in 2014 an alarming 47% of the population in eight EU Member States were reported to have insufficient levels of health literacy; 43% of adults surveyed had difficulty in grasping the notion of disease prevention and 51% of adults were found to struggle with the concept of health promotion or the ability to advance their own health.\r\n\r\nHealth literacy levels have an impact on the efficiency of healthcare systems. People that have low health literacy tend to go to the doctor more often, to be hospitalized more often or to take inappropriate treatment or prescriptions. Furthermore, they are less inclined to take preventative measures. Fostering health literacy of all citizens is beneficial for society at large as it reduces costs for public health systems which can, then, work more efficiently for those really in need of care.\r\n\r\nNowadays, the internet provides not only a vast array of health related websites, but increasingly also becomes the first information point for health issues. It eventually leads to self-diagnoses of illnesses and diseases based on this information. However, the information provided in fora and on online consultation websites has to be dealt with carefully, as not all information on diseases, illnesses, their symptoms or their treatment is correct and corresponds to the scientific state of the art in medicine.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 intellectual outputs planned over the 27 month implementation period as follows:\r\nIO1- a bespoke Lay Family Health Advisor curriculum to train local residents as health literacy tutors\r\nIO2 - an Induction Training Programme to support the delivery of the new Lay Family Health Advisors curriculum \r\nIO3 \u2013 a digital toolkit of health literacy resources addressing positive mental health promotion; diet and nutrition and preventative measures for healthy living\r\nIO4 - a suite of online tools and resources to include an e-learning portal and a suite of social media platforms facilitate interaction between the newly trained lay family health advisors", "http://www.ballybeenwomenscentre.org", "Ballybeen Women's Centre Ltd", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA204-048095_coordinator"], [2018, "Next Generation Women Technology Entrepreneurs", "Ballybeen Women's Centre Ltd", 225509.0, 8, 8, "Internet usage in Europe continues to grow and social networking sites are the new 'street corners' where today's digital natives 'hang out'. There is a growing 'virtual world' culture in Europe as the numbers of people signed up to social media platforms continue to expand. Europeans today utilize the Internet in every aspect of their lives facilitated by ubiquitous online access. With this access people have extraordinary opportunities to learn and earn in ways never before experienced and the ability to communicate and connect with those who share similar interests and views.\r\n\r\nAs career pathways that were 'born digital', technology careers are potentially free of any historic gendered division of labour and women in the technology sector have fared better than in traditional professional jobs, such as engineering. However \u2018fared better\u2019 still has a long way to go if gender equality in the technology sector is to be achieved. Less than 7% of technology jobs in Europe are filled by women. The technology and entrepreneurial potential of women are latent sources of economic growth and new jobs and should be encouraged. The need for policies and programmes designed specifically for women rather than relying on generic entrepreneurship and e-strategies is clear.\r\n\r\nThe State of the Union address of 14 September 2016 underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economic recovery and invest strongly in its jobseekers, its start-ups and its SMEs. Ensuring a promising economic future for all, safeguarding our way of life and providing better opportunities for young people were also highlighted as priorities in the \"Bratislava roadmap\" endorsed by the Heads of State.\r\n\r\nThe BizMiz consortium believe that women have a key role to play in the economic development of the EU and the technology sector is ripe for a new cohort of women technology entrepreneurs.

Skill IT will:a) address the issues of low levels of digital literacy and competency amongst adults who are disadvantaged and at risk of exclusionb) address stagnating participation in adult learning in EU countries through inclusive strategiesc) strengthen the partnership between local and regional organisations in partner countries working with the target groups of adult learners; d) increase digital competence and literacy amongst the hardest to reach groups in 7 partner countries using an innovative transnational approach involving local and regional adult education organisations, teachers, trainers and  the adult learners themselves;e) improve and extend access to learning opportunities in accordance with Europe 2020, ET 2020 and Erasmus+ goals. Skill IT transnationality allows adult learners from different target groups and staff from partner countries to cooperate innovatively in order to design and develop an innovative ICT Education Model which will be tested within the 7 partner countries: Northern Ireland; Turkey; Czech Republic; Italy; Greece; Spain; Croatia.Partners will be involved in identification of the needs of their target groups-adults with low level or no qualifications, those in low skilled occupations, unemployed and economically inactive, migrants/refugees, older people and least skilled in terms of digital skills. ICT modules will be developed is response to these needs. Implementation and delivery of the ICT modules will involve the use of peer mentoring and partners will be involved in the identification of peer mentors within their target groups to complete a peer mentoring training course.  All partners will be involved in the implementation of the ICT education model.  Skill IT will be produced in an online tool box for future use by teachers, trainers, organisations and adult learners.The overall results of the project are:- Development and implementation of effective strategies to meet the digital needs of disadvantaged adults- Enhanced adults learners' ICT literacy and competencies- Promotion and cooperation between adult educators to increase disadvantaged adults participation in lifelong learning- Enhancement of transnational cooperation and networking between partner organisationsThe Skill ITproducts are:1) A Digital Needs Analysis Report of  adults  form the target groups within partner countries - 2) A ICT Competency profile in a table detailing the expected knowledge, skills, competencies and learning outcomes of the ICT educational model.3)Peer Mentoring Training Course for adults  based on the competence profile including curriculum, course design and implementation 4) Production of ICT educational model -  curriculum, course design and implementation.5)Skill IT Toolbox with guidelines, methods, training modules to enhance disadvantaged adults digital literacy and competency6) Promotion of exchange of experiences, further adapations of the innovation and transnational networking by integrating the local stakeholders of each partner in the project7) Skill IT website with all productsThe Skill It project will enhance the digital skills of adults who do not traditionall engage in ICT Training through lack of skills, fear or ability and are at risk of exclusion.

DREAM is neither an academic project nor a project of policy makers, but a network project that works at provisional level, looking directly into practices in order to overcome the economic and social difficulties within the EU. Past, recent and projected migration into and within the EU member states has placed integration high on the priority agenda. Integration is often understood as the end product of a dynamic two-way process with three interrelated dimensions \u2013 legal, economic and socio-cultural.Within a consortium of 10 organisations from 9 EU countries and extended networks of stakeholders at national and European level, DREAM will develop and disseminate a comprehensive database of successful and effective practices and initiatives addressing all key areas for successful integration based on the Common Basic Principles for Immigrant Integration Policy in the European Union (CBP). They place the importance of EU initiatives in the field of integration on the access to education, employment, acquisition of basic knowledge of the host society's language, history and institutions, equal access to institutions, goods and services and non discrimination.The project objectives cover:- To enrich the expertise of the participating organisations for taking up further steps towards dealing with relevant issues on migrant integration and incorporating them in their domains of interest- To improve the readiness of key actors and facilitators of migrant integration in the host communities to meet the needs of diverse populations - To contribute to the improvement of the capacity and expertise of the authorities responsible for integration in countries playing the role of \u201ctransit\u201d channels to other EU countries through exchange of good practices- To support migrants in their preparedness to adapt in the host society - To build a European-wide network of practitioners developing national and European initiatives focused on key aspects of migrant integration and to promote new cooperation models- To foster the exchange of experience at EU level and enhance the dissemination and exploitation potential of existing projects focused on migrant integrationThe exchange of practices and successful approaches for integration within DREAM will be directed towards the following priority integration areas and address both migrants and integration facilitators:- As a legal process: access to education, including language education, access to social assistance, including housing and healthcare, access to information, institutional system, regulatory basis and existing national policy, border control and visas, return policy, asylum, access to rights, etc.- As an economic process: access to the labour market, national employment systems, employment offices, access to VET, searching for vacancies, applying for a job, etc.- As a social and cultural process: social engagement, social integration and inclusion, active citizenship, non discrimination, intercultural dialogue, interactions between migrants and local citizens, etc.The project will create an EU-wide network of over 100 associated partners (from the areas of migrant integration and education) which will get involved in the process of research, feedback, quality assurance, dissemination and exploitation of good practices focused on migrant integration issues. They will also build new cooperation models for influencing policy-makers at local, regional and national level for improving the life conditions, social integration and educational opportunities for migrants.", "http://www.ballybeenwomenscentre.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA204-016736_2"]]}}}}
