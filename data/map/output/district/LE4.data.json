We also create indicators with which we can view the improvement of children's well-being better and better predict future challenges\r\n\r\nMAIN OBJECTIVES          \r\n     TEACHING with two objectives:       * Increasing student\u2019s motivation\r\n                                                                         * Improving learning outcomes and \r\n     WELL-BEING with three objectives:   * Promoting children\u2019s well-being\r\n                                                                            * Supporting disadvantaged children and \r\n                                                                            * Developing multi-disciplinary co-operation \r\nSUB OBJECTIVES\r\n1. Teachers learn to confront students genuinely and caring.\r\n2. Teachers get interested in using new motivating teaching methods.\r\n3. Headmasters know better how to motivate, encourage and support teachers in their work\r\n4. Directors of education and headmasters plan new co-operation methods together with those multi-professional people working with our students and their families\r\n5. New methods produced during our project ensure that the disadvantage children get better support\r\n\r\nWORKING STRUCTURE\r\nWork is done by auditing every partner's school system.\r\n1. Starting query according project\u2019s objectives. You find the preview of the query in the attachment \"Audition; Starting query\"\r\n2. Preliminary analysis of the collected material. \r\n3. Field phase; objective groups explore the schools according their objective \r\n4. Documentation and analysis of the collected field material\r\n5. The group discusses about the school\u2019s situation with the host \r\n6. Recognizing and reporting of the key strengths and challenges\r\n7. Setting up improvement targets, follow up acts and monitoring ways\r\n\r\nWe achieve the objective by approaching it from three point of views: child's, teacher's or adult's and headmaster's or organization's point of view. Every point of view is opened four ways: a) challenge, b) target, c) act and d) indicator The diagram of the objectives and the working method is presented in the attachment \"ICLO objectives and auditive working method\".\r\n\r\nThe project is planned with our partners: Mr. William Griffiths, headmaster and director of 11 schools in Leicester, UK, Mr. Antonio Manday, headmaster from Rota, Spain, Mrs. Johanna Olsson, headmaster and director of 7 schools in Vaasa, Finland and Mr. Juha-Pekka Lehmus, director of education and the coordinator of this project, in Raisio Finland and the University of Turku and the faculty of education and associate professor Marjaana Veermans.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES \r\n We develop new modes of operations according to the objectives of the project.\r\n We audit the hosting partner city's schooling.\r\n We develop indicators for describing children' well-being.\r\n Project week's structure consists exploring local schools and social child services\r\n \r\nPRODUCTS OF THE PROJECT      \r\n1. Headmaster coaching program for better leadership\r\n2. New and shared modes of operation for schools and multi-diciplinary people\r\n3. New and effective patterns for school and multi-disciplinary co-operation. \r\n4. Relevant indicators for evaluating the improvement of students' motivation, resilience, attitude and \r\n    well-being both nationally and internationally. \r\n5. Project produces large collection of materials for scientific research.\r\n\r\nDISSEMINATION OF THE RESULTS\r\nControl Group members are in charge in disseminating the good and relevant results right after they appear. ICLO products are used when disseminating the good results by the end of the project.", "http://www.eastfield.leics.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA201-047303_2"]]}}, "9JQ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1514764800000, 1609372800000, "High Precision Process Chains for the Mass Production of Functional Struc-tured Surfaces", "Taylor Hobson Limited", "The ProSurf project aims to enhance the surface functionalities of six demonstrator parts by using a wide range of high precision manufacturing technologies, such as diamond machining techniques, enabling the mass production of cost effective, structured parts with accurate replication technolo-gies, like micro injection moulding.
