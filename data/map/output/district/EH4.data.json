It is non-denominational and has been described as 'possibly the most comprehensive school in Western Europe'.  It is home to specialist academies in music, dance and football, where pupils are awarded places on talent, not ability to pay. Nearly a third of pupils come from privileged backgrounds, while 50 percent of first to fourth year pupils live in what are considered some of Scotland's most socially deprived zones. The school is committed to the development of an international mind set. We encourage young people to view Europe as a multi-cultural, multi-lingual community and prepare them to take part in the economic and social development of Europe, helping them to become aware of the resulting opportunities and challenges. A crucial element of this is encouraging interest in and improving competence in European languages. The Scottish Government has introduced a key national priority to raise attainment in literacy and improve employability skills through learning two foreign languages. In order to strengthen provision to our pupils, we aim to address training needs such as developing staff competences, improving foreign language skills, and increasing knowledge of social, linguistic and cultural matters by accessing quality professional development through structured training abroad, specifically language immersion courses. \r\n\r\nWe are applying for funding to send nine staff to structured training courses in France, Spain, Germany and Italy to attend courses designed to improve confidence and competence in the target language, improve knowledge and understanding of the culture and develop teaching techniques.  We are applying for funding for one member of the Senior Leadership Team, one Pupil Support Leader, one science teacher, one social subjects teacher and five support staff. Individuals will participate in full-immersion, modern language training courses in France, Spain, Germany and Italy during our school holidays. This will be a long term project running from September 2017 through to the end of August 2019, with most staff attending courses during Easter, Summer and Autumn 2018 and Easter and Summer 2019. Intended destinations are Dusseldorf, Germany; Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Milan, Rome, Bergamo or Salerno, Italy.The main expected impact on participants is that they will experience high quality professional development which will improve their confidence and competence in the target language, as well as an improvement in their transversal skills such as openness to and curiosity about new challenges, problem-solving and decision-making skills, confidence, and tolerance towards other personal values and behaviours. We are anticipating, as research has demonstrated, that there will be a similarly positive effect on pupils. For instance, a 2012 EU study on the impact of partnerships between schools in different countries found that pupils - particularly at secondary level - significantly improved their skills, including cultural and social skills, IT and foreign languages.  (http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-1352_en.htm). From our own 2015 Erasmus experience, we can say with confidence that there is a positive impact on the whole school as staff form new working relationships with colleagues from other departments and across the hierarchy of the school structure. In addition pre-application training has brought together groups of staff from schools throughout Edinburgh, along with local authority advisers and representatives of the British Council: thereby contributing to new lines of communication among the wider school and local government network.\r\n\r\nBroughton High School shares the Erasmus+ programme objectives to work towards equity, prosperity and social inclusion. The school seeks to be a consistently improving organisation. Our core values are respect, inclusion and integrity in all that we do. Tolerance and a willingness to learn about other cultures have been at the heart of Scottish education for centuries. By embracing the Scottish tradition and developing through a curriculum for excellence, and extending our European dimension, we support our pupils to develop as truly global citizens. If successful in this application, we will be able to sustain the momentum created by the grant in 2015. Furthermore, it seems likely that the impact of Erasmus+ funding will be sustained well beyond the life of the project.", "http://www.broughton.edin.sch.uk", "Broughton High School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035907_coordinator"], [2015, "To extend language skills at Broughton High School in order to support the Scottish Government's initiative to Language Learning in Scotland: 'A 1+2 Initiative' and to offer a wider range of language choice to increased number of learners.", "Broughton High School", 8281.0, 1, 1, "Broughton High School is committed to developing an international mindset and ensuring that pupils are prepared for employment opportunities in globally competitive markets. It has been described as \u2018possibly the most comprehensive school in Western Europe\u2019. It is attended by pupils from from some of the poorest areas in Edinburgh (over 15% of our pupils are in receipt of free school meals), alongside pupils from affluent areas. The school incorporates three specialist performance schools for music, dance and football. The young people at Broughton take pride in the multicultural and inclusive nature of the school. Opportunities to engender social cohesion and to raise aspirations amongst those less privileged are embraced by the staff and the parental community. Recently, applications from European and Roma families have increased. Out of a total of 1032 pupils, 270 speak a language other than English.  Of these 54 languages, 12 are European Union languages. This provides a rich cultural component to the school dynamic, along with many challenges. BHS believes that investing in language learning at school is a key method of providing young people with the best possible future. Our aim is to support bilingualism throughout the school community by communicating the many employment opportunities and life-style benefits of modern language acquisition. In addition, we are keen to provide support to the increasing numbers of new admissions from European countries. EU policy is to introduce foreign language study from an early age. This is reflected in the Scottish Government 1+2 initiative which will create increasing numbers of language learners moving from Primary to Secondary school. BHS is committed to providing a rich experience to learners in a diverse range of languages. In particular we aim to equip staff so that we can offer a wider choice of languages for study. In a multi-lingual school like ours, it is important to provide a supportive environment for bilingual pupils where skills with language are valued and appreciated. Participation in Erasmus + will provide us with opportunities to develop the European dimension in school and demonstrate that bilingualism is something to aspire to. The structured language learning courses we have identified will give us access to new ideas, access to authentic, up-to-date classroom resources, and opportunities to share successful teaching methods with European colleagues.\r\n\r\nOur objectives are:\r\n\r\nTo prepare teachers to play a significant part in delivering the Scottish Government 1+2 initiative to introduce mother tongue plus two additional languages to all pupils by improving fluency in the target language, and by accessing new skills, ideas, resources and teaching methods\r\nTo become part of the Erasmus community in order to forge constructive networks with language teachers and learners\r\nTo encourage language learning at all levels by communicating to staff and pupils the manifold benefits of being able to speak more than one language\r\nTo provide staff with the language skills necessary to lead successful educational visits to European countries \r\nTo provide support to increasing numbers of new admissions from EU countries by developing competence in language skills throughout the school, including administrative and support staff\r\n\r\nThe Curriculum Leader of Modern Languages has identified seven staff to participate in the activities. Two are language teachers who aim to update and improve their skills in their third language, two are school support assistants who support learners in language classes, two are science teachers who teach EAL pupils and provide social support through the provision of lunchtime and after school activities such as the Italian club, and one is the office manager who is the first port of call for new admissions.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the above objectives, staff will participate in full-immersion modern language Professional Development Courses in France, Spain and Italy during the school holidays.\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits will be an increased understanding of the benefits of bilingualism and the preparation of learners to play a full part in the global economy.\r\n\r\nWe believe that participation in the Erasmus+ programme over a 24 month period will be a key component of the essential professional development of staff which will equip the school to become part of a movement that will lead to multilingualism becoming the new norm in Scotland.", "http://www.broughton.edin.sch.uk", "Broughton High School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013162_coordinator"]]}}, "1NR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "MOB2", "LFEE EUROPE", 324003.0, 3, 3, "MOB2 (MOBilisation of all for the MOBility of all)The Montpellier academy (regional education authority) drives for 5 years an evaluation and a voluntarist action of internationalization.

Our school motto Belief, education and quality represents this universal approach. As less nuns of our school-based nunnery play an active part in school life, it\u2019s on our teachers to focus on a valued-based education.

Moreover, the French Ministry of Education insists that all the school-children should go on a school trip once or more during their school years. \r\n\r\n2) Themes and goals\r\nThe project has three goals : firstly learning difficulties, particularly for pupils in Priority Education Networks ;  secondly, the implementation of the Secondary School Reform ; thirdly, the development of new mobility projects for the pupils and the teachers. \r\nThe project is inspired by a circular note dated February 3, 2016 on the vocational training periods of inspectors and head teachers during their probation period. It is also in compliance with the three main lines of the academic project : 1. School success for everyone everywhere 2. Learning and acting in the 21st century world 3.Investing in staff training.\r\n\r\n3) Participants and activities\r\n27 head teachers and inspectors are staying one week in a European country where they are involved in job shadowing or structured courses. There, they will have the opportunity to find out about some European education systems. They will also exchange best practices and learn how to handle pupils' learning difficulties and implement the 2016 French secondary school reforms. Their applications were studied with various criteria. They had preferably to work in a Priority Education Network and have a view of the dissemination plan they would develop afterwards. Then, through this project, our staff members will get an expertise which will make the best practices in the educational field easier to develop.\r\n\r\n4) Results\r\nThe activities carried out during the mobility period will improve the personal, cultural, intercultural and professional competences of the staff.  The staff will also develop their professional motivation and their capacity to support/coordinate future European mobility projects in their schools.\r\n\r\n5) Impacts and long-term profits \r\nThe project will have a sizeable impact on the participants\u2019 competences and professional practices. It will also strongly impact the schools, the inspection and the academy.

Such competences are being a team player, reliability and the ability to find creative solutions. By obtaining these abilities pupils receive an ideal preparation for their work life or a successful further education at the university level (with a decreasing number of drop-outs at universities as aside effect). Project work requires teachers to have completely new competences which can be acquired by attending training measures by performing in-class observer missions and by teaching abroad. These competences will then be provided to others at those teachers' schools and they will be part of the training of young teachers.\r\n\r\nProject goals\r\nProject work already completed is supposed to be lifted to a new dimension by the exchange among different European partners. All events enable the participating teachers as well as the partners to gain profit from a mutual exchange and thus transport new ideas into the everyday school life of the respective partners. Especially trainee teachers have to be involved in this process to achieve propagation of the project results far beyond the Friedrich-Koenig-Gymnasium.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThe tasks of primary importance are determined by the high-ranking school officials. The participants are highly qualified and experienced teachers in their respective fields and are rated far above average. They are the decisive number of people who immediately implement the competences acquired by the project in further project work. They also pass on these competences to the trainee teachers and to all the faculty of a school through internal school training. The trainee teachers, being sent to other state schools, spread these competences beyond their seminar school.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities\r\nObserver missions as part of job shadowing will constitute a major part of activities (during the first and the second year of the project). After a precise preparation, the participants will gather specific information at the respective locations about overall conditions and the general development of the school they visit. The participants will also get to know from up close the in-depth professional expertise of institutions other than schools they visit. They will extensively exchange views with members of the staff of the institutions visited.\r\nTeachers of the schools involved in the project will be invited in turn to sit in on lessons as part of job shadowing at Friedrich-Koenig-Gymnasium. They will be asked to report about their observations at their respective schools. Job shadowing at institutions other than schools is supposed to increase the professional expertise in certain areas (observatory on the island of La Palma, stay at Scotland). \r\nCooperating with the German School Department at Bozen, Italy, a team of teachers is scheduled to teach at Sapientia Ludens for a week both in 2016 and 2017. \r\nTwo participants each will attend europafels seminars about modern media (eLearning) and project work in Italy (Academy Rechtenthal at Tramin/Termeno). Again there will be an exchange of views and experience among the teachers of the partner schools and the staff of other institutions to gain an even more profound insight.\r\n\r\nMethods of project execution\r\nThe Erasmus representative at Friedrich-Koenig-Gymnasium will coordinate the whole project in close consultation with the project partners. In doing so, he will be supported by the school management of Friedrich-Koenig-Gymnasium. He will monitor the preparation of the participants and the evaluation and propagation of the project results. The consulting service offered by europafels will ensure that intercultural requirements of the coordination with the partners will be observed.\r\nThere will be no language barriers because the participants of all institutions involved are able to communicate competently in one of the two working languages.\r\n\r\nResults and effects\r\nGetting to know and dealing with other forms of project work, science and digital competences, the teaching staff sent on the Erasmus mission is supposed to critically reflect their own working methods and to share the results of this process with the colleagues of the schools visited.\r\nPersonal contacts grown during the Erasmus project are supposed to create long-term networking of the schools, resulting in interdisciplinary projects among the schools with the ultimate goal of enhancing the European dimension of each school. After the end of the project the project partners will send a team of two teachers each to a seminar offered by europafels. The results will then be exchanged and discussed in a workshop there.

It has students at three educational stages: nursery, primary and compulsory secondary education to the age of 16. It is a centre that for years has worked hard to improve educational practice, innovate, develop and evaluate competencies.  We are disengaging progressively from the sterile use of textbooks, building on ICT, dealing with diversity, and already have through a Teacher Training Plan four years of experience in developing these areas. We understand that training and sharing of experiences are key to the path towards excellence and also key both to transforming our centre and more widely identifying the educational needs of our system.Since starting our journey five years ago, we have become a reference center at regional level, a mirror into which many other centers and many teachers in Galicia look. For us, however, this is only the beginning of a long road along which we wish to progress. We are confident that the next step is internationalisation, the knowledge of and contact with other countries and education systems.Our Scottish partners visited Valdovi\u00f1o courtesy of a different project organized by the Regional Centre for Training and Innovation Centre, with us serving as an example of good practice in education in Galicia. This visit marked definitely a before and after in our institution, as we can now see the possibilities that we would be able to develop with them through seeing firsthand their educational system and the way they work and evaluate. Through in-depth conversations with them during and after the visit, we are fully convinced that what they can offer responds perfectly to our needs and objectives, summarized as follows:\u00b7      Develop a language immersion programme for the participating teachers at our center as we have bilingual sections and want to improve our communication skills, see different strategies work in the foreign language classroom and not only rely on visiting teachers to develop our pupils' language skills.\u00b7      Know the Scottish educational model, in its general structure and at school level.

We aim to research into active, innovative methodologies that are sensitive to different approaches in different classrooms and enable pupils to take responsibility for their own learning.\u00b7      We are aware that in Scotland teachers use evaluative and assessment tools such as classroom and whole school portfolios which we are confident could be useful tools in our country.

Then suitable topics, the extent of the project and a timetable will be determined. The pupils will use ICT within the English lessons or within a Project Week to communicate about defined learning contents.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods of project execution:\r\nThe teacher organizes the project with the partner school and will be supported with the execution by the headmaster. Additional help can be demanded from the regional Erasmus host.  \r\nThere are no language barriers because the participant is able to communicate competently in English. \r\n\r\n\r\nResults and effects:\r\nThe teacher is supposed to deepen and strengthen her own linguistic and cultrual competences and to convey the acquired knowledge by using ICT to pupils. \r\nThe school's European dimension is meant to be expanded through an international connection with the new partner schools by participating in interdisciplinary school projects.", "http://www.lfee.net", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA101-035323_1"], [2014, "ONE WEEK IMMERSION COURSE IN EDINBURGH", "LFEE EUROPE", 1006.0, 2, 2, "The course takes place in Edinburgh, capital of Scotland, a UNESCO World Heritage City.

EoF focuses on the distribution of European first feature films by cooperating with numerous distributors based in more than 40 countries in and outside of Europe. Relying on strong partnerships with distributors, this activity aims at ensuring the worldwide commercial exploitation of European films which are part of the EoF label. In order to widen their chances to be exploited/released  outside of their territory of production, the EoF distribution system combines classical distribution functioning and innovative models/circuits based on direct cooperation with distributors, cinemas and VoD platforms. In 2015, 3 VoD platforms, 13 distributors and 5 sales agents joined the EoF network of film professionals. It gathers 132 partners from which 56% are European and 44% non-European, including 52 festivals, 66 distributors, 5 sales agents and 10 VoD platforms.Within the framework of partnerships with festivals and cinemas, EoF titles are proposed under specific EoF sections, under special EoF programmes or seasons dedicated to European films. Peripheral events are also organized in addition to screenings with a promotional and educational purpose such as meetings with talents (masterclasses, Q&As, workshops). In order to guarantee a commercial exploitation to EoF films, some of them are simultaneously available on VoD platforms partners when they are screened as part of EoF theatrical/festival events. To optimize EoF titles' promotion and accessibility, EoF focuses on digital technology by making them available on platforms partners, by organizing online events (free sneak previews, day-and-date releases...) and by communicating thanks to digital tools about the films/directors, about EoF events/partnerships and about the titles' availability in theatres/online. As mentioned above, these activities have the common objective to promote European films on a global scale in order to reach a wide audience. This promotional mission also involves innovative communication/marketing campaigns and actions based on event driven strategies and an extensive use of digital tools/media.

In order to achieve the benchmark target by 2020, we must jointly identify obstacles and problem areas on the one hand and effective approaches on the other.\r\n\r\nMany researchers conclude that students' low or declining interest in science is partly due to its presentation as a collection of detached, de-contextualised and value-free facts that are not connected to students' own experiences (Aikenhead, 2005).\r\n\r\nIn the light of above, the innovative formal and informal science education plays a key role to raise both young girls' and boys' awareness of the different aspects encompassing science and technology in today\u2019s society and to enhance young people to pursue careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nSMART KIDS is one of the initiatives to contribute in addressing this complex issue through developing a complementary educational module for pupils between 10 and 14 years that will apply a learner-centred approach.

The main theme chosen for this project is: \u201cSend our Terminal BAC Pro students\u201d to give them an International experience on their CV, which is a great advantage for their professional future and recruitment.\u201d The Acad\u00e9mie de Lyon, the GIPAL and 5 vocational high schools, among whom 5 were originally involved in an Erasmus+ project have decided to carry on the adventure by inviting another vocational school to join our Erasmus+ consortium. Motivation and involvement of all partners show our willingness to work in team and share skills and practices. It is undeniable that the pooling of resources and practices has provided a new impetus and a new dynamism in the international programs coordinated by Acad\u00e9mie. Reiterating this initiative, the Acad\u00e9mie confirms its commitment to International Mobility of young people and teachers with the support of Erasmus+ Program.\r\nThis innovative consortium reflects the variety of our Acad\u00e9mie with a representative panel of 5 schools in the field of Hotel and Restaurant Business. Supported the Rectorat, this project aims at enriching the professional skills of the staff and the students. It also aims at strengthening the European dimension of this field. This internship abroad will give an international dimension to the participants\u2019 CV, a genuine added value when they are looking for a job in the near future. Within two years nearly 200 students aged 17-19 will go in 5 European countries. These students will be selected on their motivation to invest themselves in their formation. They will receive a linguistic and cultural preparation, which will be evaluated by CERL test. 22 members of staff will also take part in the project as well as 58 partners in 9 countries.\r\n\r\nThe objectives respect the recommendations of the EU commission, our decision to offer that chance to the students and staff meets the professional needs of the participants but also their expectations. All of them are eager to discover new cultural and professional horizons. We have decided to share our foreign partners and receiving companies, this a real asset because it will create an efficient partnership network and give a greater legitimacy to our consortium on the academic and european scene.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the working program have been agreed on by all the schools and they are committed to respect the phases of the project: selection and common preparation of the participants, mobility and internship and finally evaluation and sharing of the impacts and results. These stages will imply a vast panel of people: teachers, high schools, companies, academic authorities, families, associations, consulates, language assistants in France but also abroad. Each of these step is essential so that the impact felt by all of actors is in line with initial objectives.\r\n\r\nThe role of each partner is perfectly defined. The GIPAL carries the project. The Acad\u00e9mie organizes the project with the members of the consortium. The \u201cGroupe Pilotage Qualit\u00e9\u201d is in charge of developing the project, of insuring the follow-up, the management and the evaluation of the project. The latter also has to check the financial balance and controls that the various actors meet their commitments. The sending organizations will respect the terms of the mobility program of the consortium. They are in charge of the evaluation of the participants.

Wind energy is the cheapest and technologically most straightforward way to generate the majority of this energy. As a result for this the amount of wind energy installed in the EU is predicted to increase from its current level of 56,000 MW to 300,000 MW by 2030, equating to the installation of over 80,000 wind turbines. Due to the very large radar cross section of the turbines and the motion of the rotating blades, these turbines have a detrimental effect on civilian radar navigations systems and there is growing concern about the potential problems which wind turbines may have on passenger safety. Due to space limitations, wind turbines are increasingly being located in areas close to the main shipping lanes and aviation flight paths and wind farm planning applications are increasingly being rejected. As a result of the radar interference issues, wind energy companies are desperately looking for a solution. Although both electronic radar solutions and the use of Radar Absorbing Materials (RAMs) coated onto the turbines have been considered, no cost-effective solution has as yet been produced. Current RAMs are far too expensive and their performance is not sufficient for wind turbine applications. The proposed \u2018OSGRAM\u2019 project will develop an innovative continuous process for the production of intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs) whose radar absorbing properties can be accurately tailored. The ICPs will be used to produce a multilayer RAM that can achieve radar attenuation of 20dB  in the S- and X-bands and which can be applied to wind turbine towers, nacelles and blades with a weight of <4kg/sq.m and a cost of 125(Euros)/sq.m.  This will allow our SME consortium to develop world-leading RAMs, giving us global market leadership and leading to sales in excess of 80 million Euros 5 years after the project ends and increase profits across the consortium.", 279392.0, 1059925.0, 5, 9, "OSGRAM", "http://www.osgram.eu", "http://www.nitechsolutions.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58322.jpg", "fp7_92308_998105751"]]}}}}
