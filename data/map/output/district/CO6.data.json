As a result of this price fixing and market abuse by large enterprises, the SME involvement in this sector has diminished and requires research investment to re-build its presence. Additionally there is increasing pressure to replace the vulcanisation accelerator, ethylene thiourea (ETU), due to its assessment as a Cat 2 rep carcinogen as per the EU classification, IARC and EPA. It is believed that under REACH it will be classified as a CMR substance (Carcinogenic/Mutagenic/toxic for Reproduction) which will lead to legislation prohibiting or banning its use. The \u2018SafeRubber\u2019 project aims to develop a safer alternative accelerator to replace the carcinogenic ethylene thiourea (ETU) based accelerators to be used in the manufacturing of rubbers such as polychloroprene (CR) and epichlorohydrin (ECO). This will be based around a new catalyst molecule that has tri-functionality, which offers the added benefit of reducing consumption of metal oxides during manufacturing, lowering manufacturing costs and giving SMEs another unique differentiator, allowing them to compete in the market.", 59113.0, 2222733.0, 6, 13, "SAFERUBBER", null, "http://www.brppa.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/148614.jpg", "fp7_96346_991713839"]]}}, "3BW": {"cordis": {"data": [[1483228800000, 1546214400000, "Identification of legal rules and administrative processes applicable to Fuel Cell and Hydrogen technologies\u2019 deployment, identification of legal barriers and advocacy towards their removal.", "Uk Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association", "The fuel cells and hydrogen (FCH) industry has made considerable progress toward market deployment. However existing legal framework and administrative processes (LAPs) \u2013 covering areas such as planning, safety, installation and operation \u2013 only reflect use of incumbent technologies. The limited awareness of FCH technologies in LAPs, the lack of informed national and local administrations and the uncertainty on the legislation applicable to FCH technologies elicit delays and extra-costs, when they do not deter investors or clients.\n\nThis project aims at tackling this major barrier to deployment as follows:\n   \u2022 Systematically identifying and describing the LAPs applicable to FCH technologies in 18 national legal systems as well as in the EU proper legal system.\n   \u2022 Assessing and quantifying LAP impacts in time and/or resource terms and identify those LAP constituting a legal barrier to deployment. \n   \u2022 Comparing the 18 countries to identify best and bad practices\n   \u2022 Raising awareness in the countries where a LAP creates a barrier to deployment. \n   \u2022 Advocating targeted improvements in each of 18 countries \\ EU level\n   \u2022 It will make all this work widely available through: (1) A unique online database allowing easy identification, description and assessment of LAPs by country and FCH application. (2) Policy papers by applications and by country with identification of best practice and recommendations for adapting LAP. (3) A series of national (18) and European (1) workshops with public authorities and investors.\n\nHyLAW sets up a National Association Alliance not just for the duration of the project, but for the long term consolidation of the sector under a single unified umbrella.
