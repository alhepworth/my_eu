These students will increase the interest in their own studies in which they will achieve above \u2013 average results. The second activity include 6 students from higher education in nursing at rehabilitation clinic in Kreischa. The 3rd activity takes place in the Czech republic. 10 students from higher education in nursing who will be in the second year of their 3-year study programme will gain knowledge and skills concerning the basal stimulation and become familiar with nursing methods by patients with consciousness disorder at intensive care unit.

With rising energy prices and greater focus on energy efficiency the building sector offers the single largest potential for energy savings.  This is reflected in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, EPBD, 2002/91/EC. This Directive strongly encourages the use of passive heating and cooling techniques such as thermal mass in building construction and refurbishment. Passive techniques such as thermal mass offer the potential to save up to 50% of energy used in heating and cooling. However, there is a barrier to its effective implementation. In order for thermal mass to work effectively the concrete and brick surfaces must be in contact with ambient air and kept free of insulation, including conventional mineral wool type sound absorbers.
