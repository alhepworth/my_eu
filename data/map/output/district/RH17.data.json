Where conservative treatment is not effective, an \u201canterior cervical discectomy with fusion\u201d (ACDF) is performed. The source of the compression;  a herniated disc or bony spurs are removed to relieve the pressure. A cervical implant and bone graft are placed in the intervertebral disc space to fuse the 2 vertebrae together (arthrodesis) in order to stabilise the neck. \nCurrently, a bone graft, usually taken from the patient\u2019s pelvis, is used as a substrate for cervical arthrodesis. However, 15 out of 16 complications for spinal surgery are reported to arise from the donor site including pain and infection. Currently, all cervical implants require a bone graft unless they are \u201ccustom made\u201d using Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and hence very expensive. The cost of the EBM manufactured implant is prohibitive for government health service providers and is only available to private patients. EBM is also reported to have manufacturing defects, including porous (unmelted or unsintered) zones, inclusions and gas bubbles trapped in the atomised powder particles and retained in the manufactured product. \nWe have developed a Titanium cervical fusion cage, Lattice Cage, using 3D additive manufacturing to form an osteoconductive structure to eliminate the use of bone grafts and to aid fusion by promoting cell (osteoblast) proliferation, driving the new bone growth. Our off the shelf implants manufactured using 3D laser sintering will be ~ 50% cheaper than any other Ti implants manufactured using EBM, will reduce surgical costs and decrease post-operative complications\nTo support commercialisation of Lattice Cage, Winsor Medical is applying for dedicated SMEI funding, initially for Phase 1, to map out the route to regulatory approval, clinical investigations and full commercialisation.", 42583.0, 60833.0, 1, 1, "Lattice Cage", null, null, null, "h2020_205086_921064762"]]}}, "6BN": {"cordis": {"data": [[1356998400000, 1446249600000, "\"DEVELOPMENT OF MODULAR CONSTRUCTION FOR SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, STABILITY AND SEISMIC APPLICATIONS\"", "Renascent Limited", "'Modular construction is used in housing and residential buildings because it is fast to construct and of high quality. This proposal provides the research necessary to extend two types of modular building systems into  high-rise building applications where means of providing stability and in some areas, seismic resistance are very important. In addition, the proposal will lead to quantification of  the sustainability benefits and acoustic performance, that affect the use of modular construction in the residential building sector.\n\nWith this information, it is possible to develop design guidance to support the use of these modular systems and to create new markets in high-rise and mixed use buildings. The research will involve full-scale physical tests on modules and on groups of modules, and supprted by  finite element analyses as well as on -site measurements of performance. The tests will cover the basic structural performance of the modules and their connections and in particular, their  robustness to removal of supports. This will aslso simulate the loss of support and tying action in seismic events. The structural guidance will be presented in the form of application rules to Eurocode 3.\n\nCase studies and architectural information will be presented to support the use of the modular systems in practice.

This would include evaluating top-down and bottom-up approaches to systematically analyze their strengths and weaknesses and to identify key areas to be addressed by further research. The result would be captured in a readily updatable, user friendly relational data base.\n-Design an integrated assessment (IA) modeling framework where existing components are efficiently inter-connected, produce guidelines describing the key components of best practices. A number of test cases will be explored to confirm the robustness of the guidelines in practice.\n-Communicate with key stake-holders and in particular to policy-makers the state-of-the-art scientific knowledge on emission abatement assessment.\nAPPRAISAL includes 15 highly experienced groups working on both air quality and health impacts assessment.

The BEACONING demonstrator will facilitate, assess and author gamified learning activities, integrating existing educational tools and services of the participating organisations. Focusing on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), the cross-subject approach embedded in a Problem-Based Learning model will contextualise learning within real world problem solving and applications. The role of learners is amplified in the process of filtering and connecting concepts framed under practical, investigative and exploratory scenarios.  Large-scale pilots will validate and inform the development of the BEACONING ecosystem that democratises learning across and among fully abled and those with mild to moderate physical and mental impairments (age 15 to 24), undergoing general and vocational training.
