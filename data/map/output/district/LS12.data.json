Unfortunately, although the importance of parents in sport is well known, support, and education for parents remains scarce. If parents provide children with incorrect information, inappropriate support, or insufficient guidance it can have extremely detrimental effects on their physical and psychological health. For example, inappropriate parental support has been associated with reduced levels of self-esteem, increased levels of anxiety and stress, as well as excessive physical training and injury. Thus, ensuring parents are well educated and informed about how best to support and guide their children in sport is critical to minimizing physical and psychology health risks.

By uniting these experts, this project will provide a platform from which we can share knowledge, identify best practice, and subsequently improve parent education to increase the positive influence of parents in sport and minimise health risks to athletes.
