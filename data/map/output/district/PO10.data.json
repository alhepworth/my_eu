This goal requires developments by radical innovation which may then lead to \u201cdisruptive technologies\u201d. In this frame new thermal shielding and low risk return strategies are defined as European key activities in the future. In Europe the design of spacecraft for high-energetic interplanetary or sample return flights is still performed with big safety margins, which means high mass. This again leads to higher costs and a reduction in scientific payloads or instrumentation.\nAblative thermal protection materials are a key technology for current and future space exploration missions. However, the mission feasibility is determined by the materials available, and the development of new materials is performed, essentially, by an iterative trial-and-error process. This is due to the absence of validated predictive models for ablative material behaviour \u2013 models are tuned to bulk material properties from tests. For each new material, this tuning has to be redone because the models are not of sufficiently high fidelity to be able to make even small extrapolations. This means that materials cannot be designed to a specification to fulfil the needs of a particular mission. The aim of this project is to make a substantial step towards a predictive model of an ablative thermal protection system by incorporating aspects of high fidelity mesoscale ablator physics within a modular framework.\nIn order to successfully develop such physics modules, the understanding of the fundamental processes occurring within the ablative materials must be improved. To this end, existing ablative materials will be tested in the most powerful European long duration high enthalpy facilities using both standard instrumentation and advanced measurement techniques. From the data obtained, and the state-of-the-art knowledge of ablator physical processes, modules for the specific processes of internal gas flow, internal radiation and gas-surface interaction will be developed to fit inside an overall multi-scale ablator modelling scheme. The improvements made in the representation of an ablative material will be validated against the ground testing, and this advanced ablator model will be applied to realistic flight configurations to demonstrate the impact of the enhanced physics on the understanding of real ablator performance.\nThe existence of this capability will allow improvements in the efficiency and cost of developing advanced new ablative materials which are tailored to meet the specifications of Europe\u2019s future mission needs.

This project, including the participation of several SMEs and relevant end-users, aims at the collaboration among them to strengthen the European space sector and enable international cooperation.\n\nThe technical approach is focused non-local concepts for thermal management including active cooling as well as passive cooling technologies, in order to extent the capabilities of re-usable Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) towards the requirement of future space flight including hypersonic transport.

The passive systems will be based on thermal equilibration establishing an efficient heat transfer from highly loaded areas to regions with less loading. New ceramic matrix composites incorporating a new generation of highly thermal conductive fibres will be applied. In addition, active cooling will be implemented by passing a fluid through a ceramic porous structure.

The principal threat to this shore nesting species is from human disturbance. After a decline between the 1930s and 1960s, the population recovered through protection and surveillance by wardens of breeding sites. However, in recent years the population has fallen again due to a range of factors, including disturbance, predation, habitat change and high tides linked to summer storms. There has been a reduction in the number of colonies, a loss of range in the west of the UK and, in general, there are poor levels of productivity. Sea-level rise also poses a threat to a number of current colonies. The total UK population is estimated to be less than 2 000 breeding pairs.

Stories abound of houses literally dropping into the sea and local beauty spots disappearing under the waves. In the early days valiant attempts were made to combat this problem head-on: blockades and artificial barriers were put up to prevent the sea from making further incursions inland. But, as it turned out, this just shifted the problem elsewhere. It had to be recognised that the forces driving coastal change are so powerful that it is not sustainable to resist them. \n\nSo now the policy is one of \u2018managed retreat\u2019. This, however, has several implications for Natura 2000 sites, many of which are located along the English coastline.  Ensuring that the overall ecological requirements of the Natura 2000 sites are maintained in the long term requires that losses are made good by gains elsewhere, for instance, through the re-creation of areas with similar habitats. \n\nThis LIFE project developed a strategic approach to integrating the management of flood risk with the ecological needs of Natura 2000.
