A clear example of this new direction is the new pedagogical model implemented in our region called the Dynamic Multilingual Project. This new model reinforces minority languages, in this case Valencian, and English, as important pedagogical tools necessary for the promotion of multilingualism. However, the fact that secondary schools are committed to teaching in English and Valencian can lead to inclusion and access difficulties for migrant and refugee groups who have not yet mastered these languages.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem currently happening all across Europe, especially in countries that use minority languages as cultural and pedagogical tools, like Wales or Ireland. In Wales, a 21st century school project is being promoted to include Welsh as an educational language, in Italy all regional languages have the same status as Italian and their use is compulsory in the schools and in Ireland, there is a significant commitment to use Gaelic more commonly in schools.\r\n\r\nGiven the explicit and real need to promote and inclusive and high quality education for all students, especially young migrants and refugees who have language barriers to an equal access to education with minority language as a vehicular educational language, the INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL METHODOLOGY FOR INCLUSION THROUGH MINORITY LANGUAGES has been suggested.\r\nThis project aims to create a crosscutting network to contribute to an equal inclusion into bilingual educational systems of young migrants, refugees, or students with an educational lag. Five internationally prestigious entities will participate in necessary and complementary fields of this project: Acci\u00f3n Cultural del Pa\u00eds Valenci\u00e0 (ACPV) from Spain, European Language Equality Network (ELEN) from france and Europe, IAITH from UK, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) from Italy and Institute of Education of Diublin City University (IoE DCU) from Ireland, plus several secondary schools across Europe, teachers\u2019 associations, high school federations, and policy makers.\r\n\r\nTo this end, we suggest a development of the CLIL methodology and the Prisma model to develop the social, cultural, academic, and linguistic inclusion of students in an innovative way. This system promotes a new vision of educational inclusion, approaching it from a holistic perspective, which is why it is considered that educational inclusion must be accompanied by a full social and cultural inclusion.\r\n\r\nIn order for a migrant student with special educational needs (SEN) to overcome the language barriers inherent to the access to educational centers with a minority language as a educative vehicular language, it is necessary to make curriculum adaptations. It is essential to encourage their interest in this new culture and in the advantages that the mastery of these languages will grant them. To this end, the interventions should not only be carried out during school hours, but also outside of them, through extracurricular activities, and they should not only include teachers, but the entire educational community and social entities. A common effort must be done to achieve an inclusive and multilingual education.\r\n\r\nThis project will have a span of 24 months, and thanks to the creation of a network of social entities (in collaboration with teachers and secondary schools), 4 transnational meetings (in Spain, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and France) and multiple activities will yield an important intellectual result: THE METHODOLOGICAL GUIDE FOR INCLUSION IN CENTERS WITH MULTILINGUAL PROGRAMS, which model is based on a conceptual model emerged from the results of several researches.\r\n\r\nThis material aimed to the first year of secondary education (ages 12-13) will allow centers, teachers, and students to eliminate the access barriers of young migrants and SEN to centers that teach in minority languages, through four main components that boost the acquisition of this new language: socio-cultural, linguistic, academic, and cognitive processes.\r\n\r\nThis result will include a great variety of high-quality materials such as curriculum adaptations, educational units, OERs, an extracurricular activity program, the development of the innovative CLIL methodology through the Prisma Model, and learning for inclusion.\r\nThese materials will be spread among secondary schools thanks to a multiplier event and the support of prestigious entities, achieving a great impact in more than 20 secondary schools in the year after its completion, and hopefully this will become a tool promoted and used throughout the EU in the next 5 years.", "http://www.iaith.cymru", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA201-038567_4"]]}}}}
