Effective prophylactic vaccination remains the key long-term strategy for combating TB.

The traditional view that atherosclerosis is simply a lipid storage disease has recently been challenged by evidence that inflammation plays a central role in all stages of atherosclerosis. However, molecular mechanisms linking inflammation to atherosclerosis development are not fully understood, and this has severely hampered the advance of diagnostic and therapeutic programs. AtheroRemo aims to identify novel inflammatory mechanisms in vascular remodelling by combining the exploration of human biobanks with animal models and established cellular models. This new knowledge will be used to develop new preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. AtheroRemo contains several unique strengths: 1) Outstanding expertise on immunity and inflammation. Our expertise facilitates the breakthroughs in the immuno-inflammatory targeted vascular treatments. 2) Finest European cohorts to search for molecular mechanisms behind atherosclerosis development allowing us to combine underlying genetics with lipidomic profiles in multiple cohorts in order to obtain risk factors and biomarker panel related to inflammatory remodelling. 3) Accelerated target validation with novel liposomal-targeted delivery of nucleic acid-based therapeutics in appropriate animal models.

Current strategies for measuring disease progression and/or drug effect usually involve groups of animals being killed at multiple time points for post-mortem tissue analysis. Recently, transgenic strains of mice have been created in which light-emitting luciferase is produced when a disease-specific pathway is switched on or off. High-sensitivity cameras are used to follow the profile of light emission in individual animals during disease induction/treatment, thus avoiding serial culling. However generation of transgenic mice is time-consuming, expensive, and costly in terms of animal usage. A major problem is that every tissue in the mouse may emit light, so\norgan-specific effects are difficult to discern. This research programme describes the development of a process of generating light-emitting somatic-transgenic rodents by gene transfer in neonates or in utero. This permits the production of mice\ncontaining bespoke biosensors and avoids the lengthy process of production of germline transgenics. Crucially, specific organs and tissues can be targeted by the appropriate choice of application route and gene transfer vector. This technique is highly adaptable to new developments in biology (for example, new signalling targets, new genetic regulators such as miRNA and improved light-emitting enzymes) and is applicable to any strain of mouse or rat.

In response, traditional subject-based teaching is slowly being replaced by training through scenarios, such as Problem-Based Learning (PBL), which is more closely aligned with the needs of practice.

For any platform to achieve these goals, it is essential that data standards are used to enable the systems to communicate across organizations and implementations. The intention of the MEDCIN project is focused on these standards developments through MedBiquitous Consortium, the leading organization in the development and promotion of technology standards for the health professions. MEDCIN aims to systematically support medical educational process by unification of theoretical background (existing standard-based methodologies), reform endeavour (series of agreements the at European higher education area commonly known as Bologna Process) and powerful technological performance, and ensure more comparable, compatible and coherent systems of higher education in Europe. \r\n\r\nDuring the project, best-practice methodology for achieving comparability of higher education quality across Europe will be proposed including exemplar case study illustrating the conceptual way how these standards can be effectively integrated into the practise. This pilot implementation will represent a proven illustration of the conceptual way how the MedBiquitous standards can be effectively integrated into the practice. The guaranteed and high-quality curriculum in medical education is still essential, because medicine does not allow any gaps in the knowledge obtained during studies and any error in medical practice may lead to fatal consequences. From the perspective of human cognition abilities, it is not possible to carefully read and verify whole curriculum (content of all learning units with all their linkages and co-dependencies).

MEDCIN will introduce a new computational approach including a set of data mining and natural language processing techniques, which will be able to compare various curricula based on a standardized format.

The standard admission number is 60 into each year group and the average class size is 30.  By 2020 the school will have 420 children from Reception to Year Six.  \r\n\r\nThe school is a vibrant and exciting place to be.  We are ambitious for our children and seek to enable them to develop to the full extent of their abilities.  We are warm, welcoming and inclusive school, providing a stimulating learning environment in which all members of the school community are respected and valued.  We are very proud of our school and the richness of its diversity and ensure that we get to know the children and their families well, developing good partnerships.\r\n\r\nOur school is fairly new and we are beginning to forge our new identity. Recently, there have been significant changes in staff and SLT. We need to work together on a project that has the potential to enthuse our staff, bond them together and encourage them to work more closely in the future.\r\n\r\nOur principal need is for our staff to become confident teachers of Spanish. Currently our subject leader is the sole teacher of Spanish in the school. Teaching and subject leadership depends entirely on her expertise and language skills. However she is approaching retirement age so we are looking at ways to ensure the sustainability and continuity of our language provision. \r\n\r\nWe want all staff to be equipped to teach Spanish in their own class. We believe that our provision will be much more effective if it involves all staff playing an active role. One of the priorities of our School Improvement Plan is to strengthen the professional skills of our staff to ensure they are equipped with the skills they need to perform their jobs now and to make them more employable in the future.\r\n\r\nWe would like to achieve these aims through a project involving staff taking part in Spanish immersion course focused on language, methodology, culture and school links.\r\n\r\nTaking part in the course, and being immersed in Spanish-language and culture will greatly increase participants\u2019 confidence and skills. They will improve their Spanish language and will be able to use it to teach the requirements of the curriculum and embed it into classroom routines, instructions, greetings etc.\r\n\r\nWe will drastically change our current approach to language teaching. We will move away from the current structure of being fully reliant on one member of staff to teach Spanish across the school and we will build the capacity within our teaching and support staff to take an increasingly more active role through mentoring and team teaching, and eventually take over teaching entirely. \r\nDissemination activities and workshops will equip our LSAs with the skills to be able to offer more support and play a more active role in Spanish teaching. We will be more self-sufficient and less susceptible to future staff changes. We will develop materials and training activities to ensure that new members of staff are also given the opportunity to assimilate the skills and knowledge necessary.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to expand on our school\u2019s international ethos and to develop the capacity within our staff to continue the excellent work started after the retirement of our languages lead who has been the main driving force both in international activities and language teaching across the school. \r\n\r\nWe will make language learning more effective and sustainable through involving all of our staff leading to consistency, progression and better attainment for all our pupils.\r\n\r\nThis will be a two-year project focused on staff development and embedding internationalism across our school. The project would include 17 mobilities to Spain over the two years to take part in immersion courses.\r\n\r\nWe want all of our teaching staff to take part in a mobility as our main aim is to provide them with the skills they need to be able to take over the teaching of languages in their own class.
