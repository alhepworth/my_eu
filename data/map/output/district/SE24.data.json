The vocational college for child care offers a fulltime vocational training. In this context we want to accomplish our claim in three respects:\r\n\u2022 the students have to leave their home towns (comfort zone),\r\n\u2022 they go beyond their  external and internal boundaries (personal development) as they gain new experiences in social education in facilities in England or Denmark\r\n\u2022 they conceive themselves as a part of the European Union. \r\nThis step is so crucial that the effects of participating in the Erasmus project can hardly be counted. \r\nThe aforementioned competences also apply to the participating teachers. Our staff acknowledge the participation in the Erasmus project as an opportunity to enhance their own competences and to contribute to the development of our school by improving the overall quality of teaching.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the project:\r\nIn the course of the three-week or six-month placement in an EU country the participants will not only be seen as interns of our cooperating partners, but will be integrated as colleagues in the field of social education in their own right. From this ensues a manifold enhancement of competences for the participants both on a professional and a personal level. The students will profit immediately in their linguistic skills and in their personal development by the project.\r\nAll the persons who take part in the project will extend their professional, linguistic, social and intercultural competences. The participants will \u201cimport\u201c German know-how to the cooperating partners.  The overall positive effects of the project lead to a win-win situation.\r\nThe acquisition of active linguistic skills both for professional communication and in  every day contexts is a primary goal, as in the future the students will have to face the challenge of integrating people from different cultural backgrounds into German society and they will be capable of rising to the opportunities of job mobility within the EU.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\n\u2022 50 mobilities abroad for students in the course of 2 years \r\n\u2022 24 mobilities abroad for teaching staff in the course of 2 years\r\n\u2022 destinations:  England and Denmark\r\n\r\n\u2022 for participating minors surplus accompanying staff has been applied for  in order to cater for the extra counselling needs \r\nThe students come from BSZ Neustadt and the area of the Northern Upper Palatinate, mainly originating from a rural background and poor social conditions/ dysfunctional families.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities and project implementation processes:\r\nWe will cooperate with two carefully picked partners in Denmark and England.
