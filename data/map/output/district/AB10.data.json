Recent computers instead use two, four or even twelve processor cores working together ``in parallel', giving peak performance that is equivalent to a 5GHz, 10GHz or even 30GHz single processor, but at a fraction of the projected energy usage. There have even been experimental 48-core ``single cloud computer' chips giving peak performance that would exceed that of a 100GHz single processor. The effective exploitation of such high performance is essential to support modern demands for computing power in the home, in industry and in the economy at large. Combining this with low energy usage is crucial if the performance is to be delivered at a reasonable financial and environmental cost.<br/>Future designs will harness even greater numbers of processor cores, perhaps in the thousands or millions, and perhaps with widely varying speeds and capabilities. These will be combined with advanced graphics processor units and other specialist units to give further performance and energy gains.

Queries are becoming even more broad and complex essentially due to context of the search process (e.g. the system, user, language, the word and action meaning, socio-psychological dimensions, interface and interaction methods). Over the past three decades, the research in IAR had led to various search engine models, such as vector space and probabilistic models. Unfortunately there has been no comprehensive investigation at the theoretical level for effectively integrating elements of context to create advanced search technology. The key issue preventing such research is a lack of a unified theoretical framework to seamlessly integrate the dimensions of context into the search engine models and into the evaluation protocols.

Variations in salinity will incur offsets in oil and gas volume data from subsea multiphase flow meters (MPFMs), and may also indicate water breakthroughs, in which the wells starts to produce injected sea water. Both these effects bring about considerable losses for the operator. The number of subsea installations is steadily increasing and the problem is therefore felt in the industry. The only method today for checking salinity in individual well streams involves ROV intervention, a hugely expensive operation. The Idea is to develop a sample and analysis system for installation upstream from MPFMs on subsea manifolds. Integrated in the flow line, the system will sample the multiphase production from the well, allow the fluid to separate into its single phases by electrostatic coealescing and measure the salinity of the water fraction. By monitoring the salinity, the MPFM may be regularly calibrated and the offset is removed. Salinity measurements will also enable early detection of water breakthrough, where wells start to produce injected sea water instead of oil. The system will: - Improve accuracy of MPFMs by removing errors caused by variations in salinity - Enable early detection of water breakthrough through detection of said variation in salinity - Verify MPFM data by volume fraction estimation in sample separation tank SalinityScan will involve extensive development work in several research areas, including oil separation technology, ultrasound level gauging, control electronics, mechanical design and subsea instrumentation.
