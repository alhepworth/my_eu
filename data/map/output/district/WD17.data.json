However, the recent, rapid and widespread adoption of this technique has caught Europe unprepared. The resultant shortage in analytical chemical expertise has created an urgent need for highly skilled young researchers to be trained in the wide variety of SCIMS methods. IMPACT addresses this skills\u2019 shortage by establishing an intersectoral and multidisciplinary SCIMS training network. IMPACT also brings cohesion to the fragmented SCIMS research and development activities within the EU. To date, most SCIMS developments have been driven not by users but by manufacturers, whose main focus has been on increased sensitivity. However, just as crucial is improved selectivity. Indeed, many users consider improved selectivity to be the key to taking SCIMS technology to a whole new level. Instead of private and public sectors working independently, we need a fresh, intersectoral approach. IMPACT will achieve this through intersectoral work packages and multidisciplinary research projects. In place of major and costly changes in instrumental design, IMPACT\u2019s projects will focus on developing new methods for improved chemical specificity by manipulating ion chemistry. Hence, IMPACT\u2019s fresh approach will produce a step change in SCIMS instrumentation to deliver both economic and societal benefit to the EU. Specifically, IMPACT will train 10 ESRs within an integrated partnership of commercial, governmental and academic organisations, with planned secondments, 5 Advanced Training Courses, 7 interactive Complementary Skills Workshops, and 4 ESR Centred Research Meetings. IMPACT will therefore provide Europe with both a world-class capability in SCIMS technology and a cohort of highly trained researchers who will bring the benefits of that technology to citizens across the EU.", null, 2177293.0, 9, 22, "IMPACT", null, null, null, "h2020_198502_983556430"]]}}, "1JA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "European Mobility and Training Increase the Opportunities for New-jobs", "Jurys Inn Watford Hotel", 129410.0, 3, 23, "Investments in education and professional training for skills development are essential to stimulate the economic growth and competitiveness: skills determine Europe's ability to increase productivity. A report of the European Commission from 2012 proposes \"Rethinking of Education: investing in skills for better socio-economic outcomes\". This process is necessary because by 2020, 20% of new jobs will require skills at a higher level, and education must raise both the standards and the levels of achievement to fulfil this requirement and to encourage transversal skills necessary to ensure that young people are able to become free entrepreneurs and adapt to the inevitable changes, which are becoming more numerous, in the labor market during their career. In this perspective, the project EMOTION aims as objectives:\r\nO1- Increase the quality of teaching and learning by improving the skills of management and leadership of training  for a total number of 7 VET teachers participating in activities of shadowing type in Granada, during 7 days\r\nO2 - Improvement of the quality of professional training of 64 students (in 4 streams) from the fields of qualification Commerce/Trading and Tourism, participants in practice training sessions of 14 days, at economic agents  in the UK - London, between 2017-2019, in order to facilitate insertion on the labor market for future graduates\r\nO3 \u2013 Increase the capacity of a total number of 80 teachers and 1200 students from VET to trigger changes at the school level, in terms of modernization and international openness by strengthening the European dimension of the educational and professional training process, until 2020.\r\nThe project addresses to students and teachers in VET: 7 teachers will participate in direct observation by job shadowing, of the way the management and leadership of training is approached in an innovative manner, in a prestigious school in Granada, and will benefit of transfer of good practices and advice in this field; 64 students of XI th grades will participate in practical training sessions in four streams-placement  at economic agents in the UK, to improve professional skills, during two years, as follows: Stream 1 - Feb. 2018 practical training (9 pupils, Commerce, 7 pupils - Tourism) and 2 accompanying teachers. Stream 2 \u2013 April 2018 (9 pupils, Commerce, 7 pupils - Tourism) and 2 accompanying teachers; Stream 3 February 2019 (9 pupils, Commerce + 7 pupils - Hotel) and 2 accompanying teachers; Stream 4 - April. 2019 (7 pupils, Commerce + 9 students - Hotel) and two accompanying teachers. Economic operators: Sona Tours, Airworld Tours, Ariana Business Centre Travel, Almont Travel, The Ultimate Travel, Berjaya Eden Park Hotel, Holiday Inn Elstree, Hotel 55, Cleveland Hotel\r\n Expected results: seven teachers from VET will develop their pedagogical skills through comparisons between the system and methods of education in the partner countries and the promotion of learning based on active-participative methods and techniques, (this can contribute to professional development and the assumption of new duties and responsibilities within the institution). Development of the competences of management and leadership of training. On medium term - they will develop skills and abilities of communicating in English, will become more active European citizens and will develop their management and leadership skills and will involve themselves in teams to access new European funds to maintain the results.\r\n64 pupils will develop their skills and competences in the fields of commerce/trade, tourism and hotel, attractive on the European labor market, will achieve expected results in the examinations for certification of professional skills, will develop their social skills - optimizing skills of cooperation, work in networking, assuming roles in the team but also personal autonomy and self-efficacy - increasing self-confidence and motivation to perform, to learn how to think critically and independently, increasing the desire to learn autonomously. On medium term it will be improved the process of transition from education and training to the labor market; the increase of the degree of insertion on the labor market and the acquired language skills can help them to efficiently insert themselves on the European labor market, increasing their chances of acquiring a well-paid job that offers opportunities for personal and professional development.
