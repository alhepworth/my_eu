However, internationalisation seems to be hard to conceive for many sectors in the creative industries. Despite the advantages of embracing globalisation and the risks of not doing so, many European SMEs still remain focused on their national markets. The main reported reasons are a lack of financial resources but most of all the lack of skills or skilled human capital to tackle internationalisation\u201d. If we consider cultural and creative enterprises, the lack of experience is still a limit to the break-through into an international environment not yet explored. In a survey published for ECIA in November 20138, cultural and creative clusters consider their partners to be fairly experienced even though there is room for improvement (35%). Just 23% of companies are, according to them, highly experienced.The mapping of organisations, documents and events provided the evidence for a close analysis of current policy and practice in CCI export and internationalisation strategies across EU Member States (MS). The study finds a considerable and varied range of activity: EU MS are at very different \u2018speeds\u2019 in terms of their engagement with the well-documented export growth rates and potential of the CCIs. Successful projects to increase the number of internationalised CCIs must start by understanding what are the main challenges faced by CCIs:- As a first identified challenge there is the need to have a common agreement and understanding about what Internationalisation means and implies.- A second challenge is linked with the weaknesses of intermediaries. Indeed, intermediaries such as delegation of business associations abroad. These intermediaries are based on an old business model pre-globalisation, when international exchanges where rather bilateral and the flows where only in one direction.- A third challenge is that, at local level, a lack of awareness of positioning on the territory is often observed- A fourth challenge deals with the lack of understanding of international strategies at local level. - Another challenge is the lack of local settings when we consider internationalisation for CCIs. - Finally, the last main challenge identified to favour internationalisation CCIs is the access to innovative training and skills developmentAll these things considered, the project proposal is aiming at training the Creative and Cultural Industries sector on how to internationalise its services and products.The project will target all those actors that have a role in the sector being creative and cultural entrepreneurs looking to make their activity global or those support and intermediary organizations that are working on supporting the sector and enhance its growth at national and European level.More specifically the project will develop:- a competence framework for internationalisation of creative and cultural industries- a training course on how to favour internationalisation of creative and cultural industries- a training platform for the target groups of the project to find more resources, to access networks, opportunities and funds in a social learning environment- a handbook for creative industries on how to approach internationalisationThe project will test the training program and its materials in a European training event and in several national events for the target group of the project.", "http://www.creativealliance.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA202-024198_1"], [2016, "Partnership for more effective WBL in VET", "The West Midlands Creative Alliance Ltd", 201793.0, 7, 7, "One of the main EU challenges regarding reducing youth unemployment is to ensure that the developed skills of the future workforce meet the needs of the workplace. Work-based learning uses the workplace as a powerful learning environment that highly contributes to this aim.The overall aim of the project is to make work-based learning more effective so that it results in a win-win situation for both learners (resulting in an early employment outcome) and for the hosting enterprise (producing benefits). The main challenges still detected are both, an insufficient communication and collaboration between VET providers and businesses, and a skills gap among learners of transversal skills, namely entrepreneurship skills. For work-based learning to be effective and also more cost-efficient, learners need to be more proactive, creative, increase problem solving skills, reflect and conceptualise the learnt and communicate more effectively. VET teachers play a key role in this as they can act as facilitator. The project pursues the main objective of training VET teachers in helping their students to make the most of their work-based learning by applying entrepreneurship skills and to provide teachers with skills and strategies to engage in long-term school-business collaborations. The consortium unites VET providers, businesses and social partner from the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Greece, Poland and Croatia.

One of the project\u2019s main outputs  will be a toolkit \u2018From crafter to entrepreneur\u2019, designed  for members of vulnerable social groups. In this first phase for young migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, the toolkit will be divided into a series of chapters, each covering a series of important steps in the development of a craft-entrepreneurship initiative and the creation of an ethical marketing brand, from idea to the final product. This will aid the development of  the requisite  knowledge and competencies needed for the effective marketing of these ethical, sustainable crafts. The toolkit will result from expert reccommendations and the combined experiences of our partner organisations, as well as  experiences garnered from working with the case study group  in Slovenia.

Project target group is Youth of 20-25 years old. and they should be students of bachelor or master programs. During the selection process of participants the main attention will be orientated not to the person competences but to the motivation to participate in the Project. Also, applicants will have to indicate their expectations. The main activities during Project are based on creativity, however, youth will have the main goal \u2013 to create and build the performance (the spectacle) which will be publicly presented to the residents and guests of Druskininkai. In order to create unique play daily rehearsals are planned. Also, various techniques, methods, tasks and exercises are included in the program to develop and educate young people skills. Throughout the project, participants will learn and be able to use such techniques as stress management, creativity development and improvisation, ability to get away from unexpected situations, to work in a team and achieve common result. As this Project is international participants will have an opportunity to practice and improve their foreign language skills in order to communicate with each other. The result of the Project will be created play which will be not only presented publicly but recorded as well in order to have possibility to discuss about achieved results in individual and team level. At the end of the Project all participants will be asked to fill in the questionnaires in which they will be able to indicate what the Project gave them, what they were taught and if their expectations were justified.", "http://www.aryp.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-3-LT02-KA105-004489_2"], [2016, "I LIKE TO MOVE IT!", "ARYP CIC", 12899.0, 7, 7, "The results of the researches carried out reveals that obesity and should be carried out mass awareness activities related to healthy aging.

In this context, partners have been included from Romania and Italy which are countries that have high percentage of unemployment and entrepreneurship. Organisation from Sweden which has the lowest percentage of unemployment, United Kingdom and Turkey have close to average of EU.

To reach this aim, the material has to be classified according to a set of categories to be established by the teams. The teams will be composed by an equal number of pupils from each country so as to ensure cross-cultural learning, the use of the foreign languages and to enhance European contacts among the pupils and the staff. This work will be pursued and documented both during the planned plenary meetings via personal contacts as well as in the intermediate periods via ICT, specifically via the use of eTwinning. This ensures that the material the pupils are working on is constantly accessible by all participants.The following end products are envisaged: - Production of a website.- Production of a multilingual synoptical dictionary which provides an insight into how varied and rich the languages of the participating countries are when it comes to describing phenomena connected with health, sustainable development and farming.- Pupils interested in photography will be able to pursue their inspirations to produce an art book or a calendar depicting the various forms in which farming is perceived.- Production of a cookery bookIn this project the following schools with groups of about 5 members each will take part:- French school in La Chapelle en Serval is situated in the metropolitan area of the capital Paris although again offering natural landscapes being partly transformed by French garden culture and lot of allotments. This will add  an aspect that can't be shown by the other participants. - Slovakian School in Banska Bystrica central slovakia is situated in the cross-road of several conjoining valleys, its is a bustling city surrounded but mountain peaks, ski fiends, hiking trails and sheep farms. The archietecture is still of the communist style with modern archietecture slowly starting to pop up. The landscape are at first seemingly unatainble and then all at once on your door step. Once you step 5 minutes outside the confines of the city centre there is a whole new sense of being at one with raw rugged nature.- Italian school in Umbria offers a rural area which was deeply affected by farming in the past. It is interesting here to see how the area looked like in the past, the reasons why there have been important changes and bets on the farming future of the area itself. There is at the moment a lot of discussion about how the locally important but not healthy tobacco farming could be replaced by other healthy and sustainable products, also with the use of modern farming technologies.- The school in Wieniawa, puts a great emphasis on ICT technologies to enhance the learning process of the students. Teachers continuously upgrade their modern technology skills and they encourage students to use computers, the Internet and educational websites to  achieve better results. Since the school is located in an area with strong traditional farming background it will provide a unique opportunity for other European partners to see how food is grown and farm animals are bred. - Lithuanian school, believing that \"sharing is caring\", will do its best to share what we know and experience what we don't know. It is particularly relevant here in Alytus, where we are not a very mixed - race society and pupils may be less aware of the cultures of other ethnic groups.- UK School is in a very built up area of Birmingham and we will be looking at urban farming and allotments to see where city food is from and to encourage students to have a vegetable patch in their gardens to provide healthy food for their families. We are also developing the curriculum further to include not just fair trade but also organic and local produce as part of teaching in geography and citizenship.

This will also support teachers in the delivery of project work that will lead to improved pedagogy and practice to facilitate more creative approaches that will support learning for all students.Through focussed project activities with identified staff and students we will be able to monitor and evaluate project progress and impact and ensure that outcomes are met and sustainability for beyond the initial timescales.", "http://waverley.bham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA219-023901_4"]]}}, "5SS": {"cordis": {"data": [[1298937600000, 1467244800000, "Airway Disease PRedicting Outcomes through Patient Specific Computational Modelling", "Heart of England Nhs Foundation Trust", "The airways diseases asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease affect over 400 million people world-wide and cause considerable morbidity and mortality.
