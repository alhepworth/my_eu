It will also be most beneficial as our school works in line with successfully implementing the Scottish Government language policy of 1 + 2. .  During this residential course, being in a continuous presence of teachers with French practice from morning until evening with the added opportunity to meet with local people, have lively discussions and debates, friendly meals in the company of the teachers - all these will help to root our learning of French in real life and to make us progress in the language. We will gain a valuable cultural experience which we would otherwise only be able to read about and look at photographs and pictures. This will encourage us to speak French in a range of situations and grow in confidence while doing so. This can then be transfered into the classroom situation as we speak to our pupils in the French language with confidence. As we return from this immersion course feeling more confident and able to transfer our enthusiasm to our pupils, they  will be in turn become more confident and able to enjoy speaking,reading, writing, talking and listening in French. \r\nObjectives: \r\nTo gain resources, materials and methods of teaching French. To explore various methods of teaching French. to develop a cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France. To improve our competence and performance in French.\r\nParticipants:\r\n2 members of staff. Mrs Nicol (Principal Teacher) being at a beginners level in French and Mrs Murphy (Classroom Teacher) being at a competent level in French.\r\nImpact: \r\nWe envisage pupils using ICT to communicate with other schools in the U.K and abroad, and we envisage finding a partner school/schools in France/Europe to encourage: reading, writing, talking and listening in French or another European language.  The pupils will be provided with opportunities and support to communicate with other schools in the UK and in France. For example: pen-pals, mini-projects, home learning activities, communications via social media .  The French immersion course will give us motivation and confidence, based on a unique concept involving total immersion in French culture and language.\r\nDescription of Activities:\r\nA time frame will be established to facilitate activities prior to the immersion course including meetings to prepare teachers, meetings between the course provider and the school and meetings to obtain the relevant paperwork, course programme, course aims and objectives. Time will be allocated to use the online tool with guidelines and key phrases for preparation in advance. French language learning will be continued by Mrs Nicol and background reading will take place and we will attend the information event organised the LA/cluster group. Following the immersion course, we will participate in a recall day to enable us to measure the impact of the training and the Head Teacher will monitor the progress and impact of the training. We will share our resources and knowledge gained from the course with colleagues and members of staff from our partner school, Walston Primary School and the members of the learning community. We can share our resources, experiences, knowledge and skills gained from the course on social media, the school website, blogs , an exhibition in our school and in our local newspaper. We will communicate results to colleagues and parents/local community through presentations and/or workshops.\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project:\r\nProfessional learning will be recorded during the training in a learning logbook and resources will be gathered on USB keys. Professional dialogue will take place with colleagues, teachers, locals and course providers. Explore various methods of teaching French and finding partners schools in France can be investigated and the relevant inquiries can be made. \r\n\r\n\r\nLonger term benefits:\r\nA positive view teaching and learning in French. The development of resources, ideas,teaching methods and professional dialogue to be used for quality teaching and learning in French. Teacher's training in French and methodology will be vital to embed French into the everyday life of our school. Create a European dimension through the increased European links raised awareness.

Addressing the challenges that may arise in their personal or professional life, will make them develop new skills and also learn new abilities; and by overcoming these challenges, they will also overcome their fears and, by doing so, will be more confident.\r\n\r\n1. Context and Background:\r\nIn the line of work described above, our Center has been working with the Wimbledon Village Stables (WVS) for several years in the training of instructors. The basis of our relationship is centered on the complete end to end personal and professional development of the student: as a person, rider and instructor. This is a shared vision that is enriched with the particularities of their different nationalities.\r\nThe good relationship maintained with WVS and the excellent work carried out by our students who participated in the OWI, have opened new doors for us, and in this project we incorporated two partners in Scotland (Busby Equitation Center and Scottish Equestrian Center).\r\nWhat has driven us to strengthen previous collaboration, so that it could also reach our students, is to realise the enormous benefits, not only for the maturity they acquire, but also for the opportunity to learn in one of the cradles of horse riding and, more specifically, the discipline that we practice and teach, the English Discipline.\r\n\r\n2. Goals / Targets:\r\nThe goals we intend to achieve with the launch of OWII are:\r\n\u2022 Improve students' language  skills.\r\n\u2022 Develop and Improve students personal autonomy and decision making.\r\n\u2022 Promote European identity and awareness of belonging to European citizenship.\r\n\u2022 Encourage knowledge exchange and collaboration among European companies.\r\n\u2022 Make Erasmus+ been known as a program that generates added value to VE (Vocational  Education).\r\n\u2022 Associate San Ignacio corporate VT image with the European image promoted by the Erasmus+.\r\n\r\n3. Activities:\r\nWe have planned 25 mobilities:\r\n-  4 VET-SHORT, 16 VET-PLONG. For the realization of FCT in WVS, Busby Equitation Centre y Scottish Equestrian Centre For the accomplishment of the Training Module in WVS of the students taking a Medium Degree VE in Conduction of Physical Sport Activities in the Natural Environment (TECO).\r\n- 3 MOBILITIES OF PERSONNEL FOR TRAINING. For training by means of job-shadowing activity.\r\n- 2 VET-PADV. For the planning, organization and estructuring of the stay and learning for the students and teaching staff.\r\n\r\n4. Methodology:\r\nFor the development of this project \"Open Windows II\" (OWII) it has been necessary to answer the following questions:\r\n\u2022 Where will OWI be developed? (Context and Background).\r\n\u2022 What do we intend to achieve? (Goals).\r\n\u2022 What tactics and strategies will we use? (Methodology).\r\n\u2022 What resources will we have? (Resources).\r\n\u2022 How will we assess OWII's execution? (Evaluation).\r\n\r\nWe have started from the knowledge of the environment and we have analysed the initial situation in order to carry out a careful analysis of the needs; since this depends on the use of participation in the Erasmus+ Program.\r\nWe have also paid special attention to the relationship between objectives and planned activities.  And finally we have aimed to ensure a clear and lasting impact in our Centre.\r\n\r\n5. Results and expected impact:\r\nThe achievement of the established goals will suppose a significant change in our educational community. By focusing on methodologies aimed at enhancing students' social and personal skills that will help us to improve their training, we hope to correct the following weak points which we have detected:\r\n\u2022 Poor language skills and poor student maturity.\r\n\u2022 TECO\u00b4s Degree poor employable level .\r\n\u2022 Traditional poor image of the VE, for being considered as a \"plan B\" of the educational system.\r\n\r\n6. Long-Term Benefits:\r\nAn important improvement in the training of students will be achieved, both in academic-professional and personal performance, that we sincerely expect to redound to an increase in the number of students interested in participating in European Projects. \r\nOther medium-long term benefit is to apply the same or similar scope to other educational stages of the School (Secondary and High School), so that a higher level of internationalization is achieved, which is one of the core values of our Centre.\r\n\r\nSan Ignacio de Loyola is part of the BEDA Program, which consists in a gradual implementation of a bilingual Spanish-English teaching at the School. Participation in this Erasmus+ will contribute to access to level 2 of this Program (Bilingual Excellence Model).\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the success of this project will be a crucial point in order to complete the process that we have recently begun to certify our School in the Excellence and Quality Model EFQM.", "http://www.scottishequibandb.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-049787_3"]]}}}}
