Our work and effort have been recognized with the Erasmus Charter, which has been a great satisfaction for us.\r\n\r\nWe will have six mobilities : 2 for each modality of our vocational training: 2 for technicians  in Auxiliary Nursery Care, who will have their internships in Dax, France; 2 for technicians in Emergency Health Care, whose stay will be in Paris, France and 2 for technicians in Microcomputer Systems and Networks in Swansea, UK.\r\n\r\nThe participants will be those studying their second year of their training programme or for those who have graduated recently. The age of the students will be between 17 and 30 years. It is also important to consider that their socio-economic level is medium-low, so, without the help of this project, they will never be able to participate in a similar experience.\r\n\r\nFor the preparation and management of these mobilities, the work team is made up of teachers from the Health, English, French and Professional Training and Guidance departments, with the involvement of the school management members too.\r\n\r\nThe students will carry out their internships in companies according to their profiles, being their skills acquired recognized with the EUROPASS  also with the certification of the company and with the validation of the workplace training programme . The EUROPASS will also be given to the vocational training teachers who participate in the mobilities.\r\n\r\nWe continue to work with the same host partners, already established as part of our project after several years of collaboration. Throughout this time, they have demonstrated their capacity and willingness,  achieving  such good results that they have allowed us to do without intermediary agencies.\r\n\r\nWe maintain the 4 mobilities for teachers in a vocational training centre in France, in collaboration with the Red Cross. The participants will be teachers of vocational training, interested and involved in the European dimension of education.\r\n\r\nWe intend to add an incoming mobility, inviting an entrepreneur from one of the partner companies (Air Assistance Ambulance)  to come to our school  to inform and train the students of the Emergency Health Care programme  about issues related to their professional profile in France. This will undoubtedly enrich the training of our students, allowing the participation of all of them, motivating them in the project and of course, strengthening   our partnership with this company.\r\n\r\nAs a novelty we are going to introduce a series of diffusion activities in collaboration with \u201cErasmus Student Network Cartagena , under its project \"Erasmus in School\" in order not only to continue making our project known both within our school and the city of Cartagena, but also to motivate the students in previous courses since they can be future candidates to participate in our  projects. This association has a series of activities that we have planned to implement for students finishing their last year of Compulsory Secondary Education and Senior High School (Bachillerato). This plan will be developed during the school year.\r\n\r\nWe continue with the activities of diffusion of the project within our school, both for the teaching staff as well as for the students. We have also envisaged a contest for the cultural week, which our school organizes every year. The aim is to find a slogan for the next Erasmus project with the proposals of our students. In addition and taking advantage of the appearance of the Digital Magazine of our school during this course, we will use this resource as a means of dissemination.\r\n\r\nWe request again the figure of the accompanying teachers, one for each mobility, due, in part to the fact that we have underage students, as well as students, who despite being over 18 years  do not have experience abroad, or have not travelled previously or are even lost when dealing with certain circumstances of the mobility such as travel, presentation in a new foreign company, location in a new environment and so on. The experience of previous courses shows us the need of this figure that serves as a guide in these first days of mobility, providing security to students and even, sometimes, giving them the last push to make the decision to participate in the project.\r\n\r\nWe are conducting a search for new partners through resources such as EURES, EPALE, etc., as well as various websites of vocational training schools in different countries of Europe in order to expand our project and continue to grow and create opportunities for our students in new countries.\r\n\r\nThe teachers of the French department, participants in the  project Erasmus, are developing an e-Twinning project with the Coll\u00e9ge Fran\u00e7oise in Limoge (France) in order to transmit to the participating students and the school itself, the idea of a globalized world bringing another culture closer to the context of a teaching increasingly oriented towards internationalization.", "http://www.giakonda.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA116-047857_3"], [2017, "ERASMUS: APRENDER EN EUROPA SIN LIMITE NI BARRERAS.", "Giakonda Ltd", 21562.0, 3, 6, "Our school, IES EL BOHIO, is located in a rural area and its students come from nearby villages and they belong to families who, unfortunately, live in lower-economic conditions. In this sense, our project offers a great opportunity to train our students professionally in another country. The aim of this project is to give continuity to the one started in 2011; providing the students with specific mobilities, which encourage their European awareness and having the vocational teaching staff involved in the training process as well.\r\nPrecisely, the project is addressed to vocational training students from IES EL BOHIO( Secondary Education and Vocational Training School ).

In addition, 4 mobilities for vocational teachers are included in the project for having a job shadowing training program in France.\r\nIn order to prepare, settle and start these mobilities, teachers from IT, Health, English, French and Professional Orientation Training departments will work together as a team, counting on the full support and involvement of the management board of the school. \r\nDue to the specific features of our vocational studies, the age range of our pupils varies from 17 to 30 years old, so students under 18 may be part of the program.

Furthermore, the EUROPASS certificate will be also granted to the teaching staff.\r\nSo as to guarantee a right implementation of these internships, the tutors from the hosting companies will be fully informed about the capacities, skills and competences that our students will have to achieve during their stays. Their tasks will be clearly stated and specified in training agreements, signed by all the parts involved in the process. Needless to say that the hosting company and the tutors in Spain will have a direct and fluent interaction by means of the internet, using tools such as social network sites ( Facebook,...), Moodle, Etwinning and so on.\r\nThe results and conclusions drawn after the end of the mobilities will be shared by all the members of the teaching community of IES EL BOHIO.  Moreover, it will serve as a reference to other institutions located in our region, Regi\u00f3n de Murcia. The job shadowing training program will also allow the vocational training teachers to have a deeper knowledge of the companies which host our students during their internships. To make the project have a valuable impact, the mobilities will be available and shown in most of the relevant social networking sites and web pages.\r\nThese actions will have a great impact on our students since they will be able to improve not only their foreign language skills but also their professional and team ones. Furthermore, the program intends to make our students be familiar with other working environments and cultures from other countries. These experiences will enable them to adapt and cope with unexpected situations. Obviously, all these facts will enhance their professional qualification, future employability and entrepreneur spirit.\r\nWithin the school, students from lower courses will know the possibility of applying for this type of grants.
