Such exclusion translates to unbearable costs both to the individual, being deprived of access to important assets, and to society, having to finance the burden of marginalised groups instead of benefiting from their productive potential.Through the concept of online communities, ICT has the potential to serve as a gateway to social inclusion. However, computer and internet access of marginalised young people are limited, raising the need to develop alternative methods to approach them through ICT.The main objective of ComeIn is to study and utilise mobile networks and telephones that are most commonly used by marginalised youth, as the main infrastructure for social inclusion. Using innovative real-time integrated communication video solutions, this project will develop a networked media platform that will give rise to mobile online communities, delivering interactive media content specifically aimed at marginalised youth.This approach combines the benefits of the online community concept with an inclusive approach, realised through the most abundant device used by marginalised youth in Europe \u2013 mobile phones.The goals of this exploratory project include:-Provide groups of marginalised youth with ICT based mobile online communities-Design and deliver content aimed to facilitate social inclusion of marginalised youth of various backgrounds-Analyse the impact of ICT and mobile network use by marginalised youth and make recommendations for future researchAbove the technological impact, such a programme will provide young people with knowledge, capabilities, networking and skills which will better their chances of becoming integrated and productive members of the EU.Our team includes communication experts, researchers in social sciences, and organisations that specialise in working with maginalised youth.", 253459.0, 2226067.0, 6, 8, "ComeIn", "http://www.comein-project.eu", null, null, "fp7_88970_998827334"]]}}, "7BA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1464739200000, 1527724800000, "Advanced wheel measuring system for greater rail sector\u2019s profitability", "Prophotonix Limited", "The final aim of Wheel Watcher project is to boost the profitability of the railway sector by means of an advanced wheel status monitoring and control system, providing railway operators with accurate and real-time information on wheel wear to drive preventive maintenance actions thus avoiding premature replacement of this equipment.\nMain industrial impact of the project is to achieve a wheel life increase of 50%, and an increase of 25% of distance between wheel reprofiling actions, allowing the railway operator for conducting a remote but in-depth inspection of wheels. This industrial impact involves a subsequent relevant economic impact, targeting a cost reduction of 25% in maintenance-related costs as a result of less spare wheels and less low value-added works needed.\nThese industrial impacts rely on relevant technical progresses: a high precision mechatronic platform addressing mechanical challenges derived of its wayside placement, a remote measuring unit comprising an ad-hoc thermoelectric cell guaranteeing thermal stability under potential extreme weather conditions, and a novel laser system doubling current power density available, able to measure trains moving at high speeds in outdoor locations, and a user-friendly control software including a self-diagnosis tool. WheelWatcher will have a deep impact on project\u2019s partners, producing an aggregate profit of 23 M\u20ac with more than 35 new jobs expected to be created, and a positive environmental impact due to less CO2 and less scrap.\nExcellence of the project will allow for dramatic improvements regarding the more relevant challenges faced by railway operators, as compared to the current state-of-the-art: automated high frequency wheel measuring, enhanced quality of measurements at normal speed (100 km/h) irrespective of weather conditions, remote monitoring without costly displacements to the tracks, no need of service disruption during measuring processes, and as consequence of all, a cut on operating costs.", 313059.0, 2351604.0, 3, 5, "WheelWatcher", null, null, null, "h2020_204983_924322410"]]}}}}
