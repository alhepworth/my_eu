The school is situated on the west coast of Scotland and the Primary currently provides education for 228 pupils across 9 classes.  A Learning Centre is also incorporated within the school catering for children with complex additional needs.\r\nThe Primary School are currently delivering French to pupils throughout the school as part of the Languages 1+2 initiative.  Two members of staff have been previously trained through the Modern Languages In Primary Schools (MLPS) programme and all staff were recently trained in the use of the Power Language Schools platform.  This training has enabled staff to increase their knowledge and confidence in delivering French to all classes.  \r\nThe school is in the second year of introducing the first of the languages for Languages 1+2.  French was chosen as language 1 and all staff have been trained in the use of the Power Language Schools platform to support the teaching of French.  The staff have varying levels of confidence regarding the teaching of French with some staff having no previous French knowledge to draw on.  Training has been completed at local cluster level with support from trained local authority colleagues and also at school level with more experienced staff supporting those colleagues who are perhaps lacking in confidence.  As the pupils progress with their knowledge of French, the staff competences and methodology are constantly having to improve also.  Further staff training and support has therefore been identified as an area for development and it is planned to be included in the school's improvement plan.  The European dimension of learning another language has also been identified as an area for development.\r\nAn LFEE French immersion course has been identified as a suitable development opportunity to support the current needs of the school.  A member of staff, Mrs Lees was chosen as the most appropriate person to complete the training.  Mrs Lees is an experienced class teacher and has completed the French MLPS course.  She is committed to promoting the teaching and embedding of French within the school and this international experience will further develop her skill set so that she can support and train colleagues both within the school and within the local cluster. \r\nMrs Elizabeth Lees is an experienced class teacher and has been delivering French throughout the school for a number of years having previously completed the MLPS training.  She is currently teaching a Primary 2 class and is embedding French language teaching throughout the school day.  She has supported other staff in the teaching of French through the introduction of Languages 1+2 and has included embedding French in the classroom as part of her professional development.  As the LFEE Immersion Course is GTCS accredited, attendance at the course will allow Mrs Lees to apply for accreditation and further her professional development.\r\nLocal authority staff specialising in the delivery of Languages 1+2 will support Mrs Lees both prior to and following attendance at the immersion course.  \r\nPrior to attendance on the LFEE immersion course in July it is hoped that Mrs Lees will spend time with some native speakers to develop confidence with use of language which may be required on the journey.\r\nDuring the course it is hoped to extend cultural awareness of the region being visited as well as fluency in delivering class lessons.\r\nFollowing the course it is anticipated that Mrs Lees will deliver training to colleagues within the school and local cluster through twilight sessions and workshops.  Making use of new resources, ICT and the Power Language Schools platform will enhance and develop the methodology for teaching French as well as boosting the confidence of the staff who have less background knowledge in French, ensuring the successful delivery of the Languages 1+2 initiative.\r\nA parents' workshop will be provided, allowing parents to develop their knowledge and understanding of Languages 1+2 and how they can support their children in the learning of an additional language.\r\nMrs Lees also plans to introduce a European dimension through the use of the e-Twinning tool in order to develop links with a French school, strengthening international awareness.  These links will be developed with the children through an after school/lunchtime club.\r\nThe development of the Languages 1+2 initiative will be included in the school's improvement plan for the following session.  Having the opportunity to be immersed in the culture of France and have the experience of speaking French with native speakers in a variety of contexts will undoubtedly raise the confidence of Mrs Lees in the use of spoken French. This increased skill set will then transfer to the pupils and staff that she works with.", null, "Lochgilphead Joint Campus", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047205_coordinator"]]}}, "8PS": {"life": {"data": [[1997, "Atlantic Oakwoods - Restoration of Atlantic Oakwoods", "Caledonian Partnership, Highland Birchwoods Ltd", 2765725.0, 1382863.0, "Moss and lichen-rich old oak woodlands are an Annex I habitat type restricted to Britain and Ireland where this is the climax 'temperate rainforest' community of Europe's Atlantic coast.

Underplanting and replacement of broadleaved deciduous species by exotic conifers; invasive plants like rhododendron; increasing pressure from deer browsing which reduces natural regeneration; and in some areas high visitor numbers, are among the key threats to these ancient oak woodlands.\n\nThe project was concerned with improving the habitat condition in seven of the most extensive Atlantic woodlands in Britain, ranging from Loch Maree in the far north-west of Scotland, through the popular Loch Lomond woodlands within easy reach of Glasgow, to Borrowdale woods in the Lake District and Meirionnydd oakwoods in north-west Wales. Together they cover nearly 4,900 ha of Atlantic oakwood habitat.\n\nAt each site, a set of management targets was to be established based on the most important perceived threats. Actions would target the clearance of around 690 ha of exotic conifers and broadleaves, treatment of around 405 ha to eradicate rhododendron, and treatment of a further area of over 370 ha to control bracken.

The last Youth Exchange between the two regions took place in 1995. \r\n \r\nIn 2015, Argyll & Bute hosted a delegation of German Youth Workers, teachers and Volunteers from Amberg-Sulzbach with the main focus to re-establish Youth Exchanges between both areas. During the week long visit, the Amberg-Sulzbach delegation meet with Youth Services staff and young people showcasing Youth Work programmes and meeting partner agencies across the authority. During this visit the idea of an exchange was discussed with local Youth Forums and groups from Oban & Bute took part in the first leg of the exchange in Amberg-Sulzbach in August 2016 and in the hosting Exchange in Oban and Bute in April 2017. In total, 6 staff members, 2 of which were volunteers and 25 young people aged 12-19 took part, 10 from Argyll & Bute and 15 from Amberg-Sulzbach. The objective of the exchange was to explore issues around health & wellbeing in both countries including young people's mental health. The results showed similarities in factors affecting young people's Health & Wellbeing and mental health between the Scottish and German groups.\r\n\r\nThis Exchange will build on the relationship with the KoJa Amberg-Sulzbach and will involve the areas of Bute, Campbeltown and Helensburgh from Argyll & Bute. This will give the German young people a greater understanding of living in a rural region and the transport challenges faced by communities across the region. The first stage of the Exchange will explore the themes of Environment which is relevant to Argyll & Bute due to its coast line,  use of renewable energy sources and the zero carbon/recycling targets. In addition to the Environment, we will look at the integration of refugees. This is particularly relevant to both Armberg-Sulzbach and Argyll & Bute given the resettlement of Syrian Refugees in both countries. We will explore the issues facing migrants and the everyday barriers that they face in a new country, local attitudes towards their resettlement, their support programme and investigate any experiences of Anti-racism, Hate Crime or Anti-Semitism and will compare and contrast the experiences of refugees in Argyll & Bute and Amberg-Sulzbach. Exploring this issue in depth during the exchange may help give some young people a greater understanding of refugees circumstances and change their attitudes, which are often formed by what they read on social media, hear from their peers or from family. Often these are negative and extreme views towards refugees.\r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits of this Exchange will hopefully lead to many more future Exchanges and collaborations between the two regions involving different areas of Argyll & Bute and strengthen the relationship between the Youth Workers", "https://www.argyll-bute.gov.uk/home", "Argyll & Bute Council - Youth Services", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA105-047768_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"data": [[1443657600000, 1546214400000, "Business Gateway Local Growth Accelerator Programme - Argyll and Bute", "Argyll & Bute Council", "To provide support SMEs who demonstrate growth ambition, and deepen support available to those already growing.", "ERDF", 272100.0, 544200.0, "erdf_scotland_55"]]}}, "8SN": {"life": {"data": [[2000, "Scottish raised bogs - Restoration of Scottish raised bogs", "Scottish Wildlife Trust", 1736851.0, 1184533.0, "Since the start of the nineteenth century the extent of primary, active, lowland raised bog in the UK decreased from 95,000 ha to 8,100 ha, a decline of 85%.

Public relations - dissemination of Erasmus + projects\r\n6. Getting to know and appreciate new places and cultures\r\n \r\n1. Quality Assurance:\r\nSchool education must be comparable with other vocational education and training systems. Educational objectives and learning outcomes must be clearly described. The allocation of ECVET points for the learning results must be carried out by a superior expert team uniformly for all schools; teachers of the HLW Rankweil are ready to be part of working teams.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications which our pupils have acquired during their internship abroad will be made visible by the partner companies and the HLW. Practice-oriented teaching while incorporating the knowledge and working techniques acquired abroad is implemented.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of language certificates (DELF, BEC, DELE and CILS) and specialised certificates (boys' chefs and cheese chefs) increases the quality of the training and must be promoted and financially supported.\r\n\r\nMotivation of the pupils to participate in language competitions.\r\n\r\nTeachers must constantly update their knowledge and skills and are encouraged to pursue professional development at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nTeachers are motivated to complete internships during their summer holidays both in local and foreign companies.\r\n \r\n2. Expansion of partnerships with foreign companies\r\nIn recent years, the Board of Trustees has been able to establish a network of 40 partner companies abroad. Currently there are only partnerships with tourism companies. The network is to be expanded with other industries.\r\n \r\n3. Social commitment\r\nWhen engaging in social services, pupils should show responsibility for the well-being of people in Europe. We want to deepen our commitment and further develop the project \u201cStreet Children\u201d in Romania and Bulgaria.\r\n \r\n4. Strengthening the idea of the European Union\r\nThe philosophy of the EU and its importance and impact should be increasingly explored in teaching. Students of the third or fourth year are to visit the EU Parliament in Strasbourg as part of an excursion. Increased travelling exhibitions in the school. EU experts as speakers to the school.\r\n\r\n5. Public relations and dissemination of the project should be substantially improved. A focus group is to be appointed for this. New media will be increasingly involved.\r\n \r\n6.
