The research applied in all the partner schools showed that the students lack motivation for physical activity and the level of obesity is increasing. Most of the students have a sedentary and an unhealthy lifestyle. According to the students\u2019 interests and recommendations the project\u2019s team decided to implement a project that determines the actors involved to recognize, highlight and celebrate their own culture and to present it to other school communities through written materials, dance, music, sport, drawings, pictures, games and food emphasizing that our own culture can help keep us healthy. The project would be supported by a high use of ICT ranging from digital photography, video, internet, TV, email and blogging.OBJECTIVES:- to expand the social science curricula in promoting European citizenship in 5 European schools by 2018;- to increase understanding and responsiveness to social, linguistic and cultural diversity of a total number of 1500 students;- to promote dynamic lifestyles by encouraging students\u2019 creativity to promote their own cultural heritage;Students: There will be teams of 30 students in each partner organisation so 150 in total will take part actively in the project\u2019s activities. Approximately 1500 students will indirectly be involved.Teachers: There will be teams of 5 teachers in each partner organisation so 30 in total will take part actively in the project. Approximately 150 teachers will be indirectly involved.Administrative staff: The head teacher and a deputy head will take part in the project. Approximately 25 administrative staff will be indirectly involved. Families: There will be approximately 100 families in total and they will contribute to introduce the host country\u2019s culture, tradition and to prepare traditional food for international evening. Approximately 400 family members will indirectly be involved. Local community: Local community like local press, municipality, directorate of national education and PTA will help to disseminate the project to a wider community. In the frame of democracy, we will also provide an opportunity for people with fewer opportunities and migrant families to increase their involvement within their new school communities in a constructive and self-esteem enhancing way. In addition, equity and inclusion of disadvantaged participants will be involved through the activities.The partnership will support participants to re-engage with their own culture, highlight it to partners helping to breakdown stereotypes.  All partner schools realize the importance of students developing the appropriate skills for life in the 21st century and the activities of the project facilitate team working, development of ICT skills, communication and the further development of entrepreneurial skills.Two types of activities will be developed during the 4 learning teaching training activity meetings.1.After school activities: Arts, dance, sports, board games, traditional games, playground games, practicing a healthy diet.2.Cultural activities: presenting traditions, organizing cultural nights, introducing famous musicians, writers, philosophers, players and national characters.There are 4 L/T/T/A in two years and 2 T/M at the end. During each exchange meeting, the host school will organize dynamic social activities (cultural and after school activities) related to Art, Music/ Dance, Sport and Cuisine/ Healthy food/ Healthy habits. Before and after these exchanges every partner school will organize same/ similar activities in their own school promoting the dynamic spirit among their students.There will be created four distinct outcomes (games/ exercises/ activities) related to Art, Music/ Dance, Sport, Cuisine/ Healthy habits linked to culture and democracy at the end of each meeting with students.The final result is an eBook containing all the outcomes created by students and it represents an innovative set of tools that can be used in the educational process.The tangible results of our project are: logo, brochures/ leaflets, project\u2019s website, project\u2019s scrapbook, posters, video, presentations, reports, questionnaires, exhibition, evaluation sheets, DVDs, eBook.The project will have a visible impact on the direct and indirect participants. The opportunity to directly work with students and teachers from other countries for achieving common goals will lead to positive changes at a personal level and within institutions involved.Students\u2019 will increase their self-esteem, confidence and creativity. Teachers will improve teaching approach in the frame of European standards. Both students and teachers will improve English communication and ICT skills.The social sciences school curricula will be improved by introducing and applying the new outcomes created during the project.", "http://www.francisaskew.org.uk", "FRANCIS ASKEW PRIMARY SCHOOL", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024630_coordinator"], [2016, "EDTECH AND CLIL CREATE SMILES", "Francis Askew Primary School", 4733.0, 3, 3, "CONTEXT :San Miguel is a school in Armilla, a metropolitan village located in the Vega of Granada , Spain .
