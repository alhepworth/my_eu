Improving these skills will help our pupils to become less insular and to enjoy their lives, enabling them to participate more fully in their communities and to become more socially integrated.  Participating in this project will build confidence among our pupils and equip them with essential skills that will be useful to them in all aspects of life, but especially in the world of work.  \r\n\r\n2) Provide opportunities for specialist teachers and education staff to improve their own practice through the sharing of ideas and professional expertise with European colleagues.  \r\n\r\nA particular focus in this project is communication and interaction - staff will be given the opportunity to develop skills in teaching and working with children and young people who have specific difficulties around communication.  Each school is unique in the way that the curriculum is designed and delivered and all will benefit from being able to experience this first hand through visits, job shadowing and organised training events.  By participating in this project, schools will feel more confident and equipped to incorporate outdoor, pupil-led and sensory aspects within their respective curriculums, thus appealing to a wider range of learning styles and needs.\r\n\r\nThere will be approximately 400 children and young people who will participate in this project, the majority of whom have learning difficulties and / or disabilities, particularly around communication.", "http://www.thomasbewick.newcastle.sch.uk", "Thomas Bewick School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000211_coordinator"], [2017, "European Super Skills", "Thomas Bewick School", 140354.0, 5, 5, "'European Super Skills' ('sEUper skills') is a three year project with the ultimate aim of promoting better life outcomes for vulnerable children and young people aged between 3 and 21 years, particularly those who have special educational needs and disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe project is driven by a shared belief that all children and young people can make a positive contribution to their local and wider communities, whatever barriers or challenges the may face in their day to day lives, and that all children and young people have the right to be supported to achieve their individual potential.  The project has therefore been designed to promote a range of personal or social competencies, or 'Super Skills', that we feel are crucial in supporting this vision.\r\n We want all of our children and young people to:\r\n- develop a sense of independence and learn essential life skills (Super Skill: To be independent)\r\n- develop an understanding and appreciation of the needs of others (Super Skill: To be caring)\r\n- challenge themselves and step out of their 'comfort zone' (Super Skill: To be part of new experiences)\r\n- display confidence within a range of activities and environments (Super Skill: To be sociable)\r\n- participate in meaningful interactions with others (Super Skill: to be sociable)\r\n- appreciate the importance of living a healthy and active life (Super Skill: To be healthy and active)\r\n\r\nThere are five schools from five different countries within this partnership  - England, The Netherlands, Finland, Spain and Poland.   Three of the five schools are special schools (England, Spain and Holland), and the other two have specialist provision within a mainstream setting for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities.  Three of the five schools (England, Spain and Finland) provide education for children with complex special educational needs and disabilities, a large proportion of those with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). \r\n\r\nOur nine project activities are complemented by eight transnational mobilities and are designed to promote respect for others, nurture individual strengths and celebrate cultural differences and diversity.  More local issues such as childhood obesity and employability are also addressed within the activities.", "http://www.thomasbewick.newcastle.sch.uk", "Thomas Bewick School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036699_coordinator"]]}}}}
