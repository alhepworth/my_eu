Programme partners are Scotland (UK), Germany, Sweden and Italy.The origins of the name \u201cSpinach for Popeye\u201d is based on a TV cartoon character \u201cPopeye\u201d which featured in a popular worldwide children\u2019s programme during the 60\u2019s, 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s.   \u201cPopeye\u201d the \u201csailor man\u201d, got himself into all types of difficult situations, and in times of need he ate spinach to give him power and strength to tackle things and overcome adversity .... and it always worked.  Our \u201cSpinach for Popeye\u201d programme is based on the concept that we (practitioners, the youth exchange programme, and approaches we adopt) can be the spinach to give young people the additional strength to tackle the situations they face.This youth exchange will give 32 young people, aged around 14 to 16, and 2 young peer mentors (participants from previous exchange \u2013 host country only) the opportunity to participate in an invaluable learning and fun experience.  All the participants are those within the transition stage between school and world beyond, but as yet do not have positive destinations.  All are those with fewer opportunities who face a range of issues and needs at school, in the community and / or within the family, and many have low levels of confidence and self-esteem.  The exchange will be held in Falkirk, Scotland, and will run from the  28th June till the 5th July.  The programme will consist of - participative creative workshops, cultural presentations and activities delivered by the young people, group and individual activities and tasks, reflection activities, team building activities, visit to a local school and local attractions, outdoor activities, as well as a trip to our capital city \u2013 Edinburgh.  We are hoping that the project will support the young people to develop longer term employability skills, life skills, and positive attitudes / behaviours that will help them when entering into the labour market, and life in general.  As partners we are realistic about our anticipated outcomes - we know we can\u2019t and won\u2019t completely turn around the lives of all the young people who participate, however, we know from our experience of previous exchanges, that there will be noted differences to varying levels (some quite remarkable) in all who participate, around e.g. - attitudes, tolerance and respect for others, motivation, ambition, self-worth and self-esteem, peer support, sense of achievement, changes of behaviour, being more approachable, being more open and responsive to taking part and listening to others, awareness of European culture, and generally becoming more informed and active EU citizens.Lastly we all share the belief in the value and importance of non-formal learning methods and the learner centred approach.", "http://www.falkirk.gov.uk", "Community Learning and Development Service, Education Services, Falkirk Council", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA105-023311_coordinator"], [2015, "Spinach for Popeye", "Community Learning and Development Service, Education Services, Falkirk Council", 14662.0, 4, 4, "Spinach for Popeye is a EU-project that has been active for 14 years. The project contains two parts; a youth exchange and a exchange for learners and staff. It has been a part of the Youth in action program, Erasmus+ since 2014. The purpose of the project is to inspire participants to be active European citizens, to increase the solidarity and tolerance among Europeans and make them part of the creation of the common future of Europe.\r\nParticipants hail from \u00d6rgryte-H\u00e4rlanda SDF in Sweden, Falkirk in Scotland, Odenwaldkreiss in Germany and Nuoro in Sardinia Italy. The participants are all current professionals within the fields of School or Social services.\r\nEach year there is a youth exchange, with 8 youths and 2 staff from each country, and another exchange for 8 staff and learners from each country called congress. The theme of the congress is professional work with youths who, for one reason or another, has difficulties completing school and joining the work force.\r\nThe congress subject for 2015 is \"School as a health promoting arena\" (SHPA) and will be held 28th of October to 2nd November in \u00d6rgryte-H\u00e4rlanda. A municipal district of the city of Gothenburg.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n1. Reduce health inequalities.\r\n2. Promotion for equal opportunities in life. \r\n3. Prevention of social problems.\r\n4. Reduce school dropout rate and increase school presence.\r\n5. Organize and plan for students participation and influence in school and community as a whole.\r\n6. Develop the partnership between schools and parents.\r\n7. Take measures to promote children\u2019s learning\r\n8. Provide accessible cultural and leisure activities to all children.\r\n\r\nThe participants at the conference consists of 32 professionals from the four participating countries, Scotland, Germany, Italy and Sweden. Nominated delegates are all active in organizations that caters to the target group of young people at risk of exclusion from school and work. Delegates contribute their own knowledge and experience from their own organizations, bringing back new learning and thus contribute to development in the area . The countries have also worked towards a widespread age and gender distribution of the participants.\r\n\r\nActivities \r\n* Opening ceremony and team building\r\n* Theoretical day. Lecturer's Ulrik Fostvedt, project manager with special focus on school development and exclusion, G\u00f6teborg municipal Region. The lecture is based on some of the theories that are within the SHPA and aims to tie together theory and practice.\r\n* Method day. The social service in \u00d6rgryte-H\u00e4rlanda presents methods linked to the theories presented during the theory day. The methods are intensive home based family work, the network mode, \"Macho factory\" (standard critical method to smooth the differences between men and women), United Sisters (method to strengthen young women's self-esteem), MBU (The man behind the uniform) that describes how to increase the confidence in the community, Supported employment and Young and safe (work with crime risk youth).\r\n* Presentation of \u00d6rgryte-H\u00e4rlanda Best practice: SHPA. A health promotion arena involves working with children and young people's health factors that stimulate and encourage their development. There is consistently structured actions throughout the district, where you go from health promoting islands to a more structured public evidence-based health work.\r\nTo combat truancy, home-staying and dropouts is to promote attendance. This is done by making the school environment provide a good social environment with high SOC, participation, opportunity for change, interaction and influence. School should be a reflection of society in miniature.\r\nHealth promotion in schools can only be conducted in close collaboration between parents, students, school, other actors such as culture recreational, social services, etc.\r\n* Participating countries will present their best practices as a mini exhibition.\r\n* Visits to the Torpa School where we have developed the method \"School as a health promotion arena\".\r\n\r\nMethods for activities during the week will include team building, lecture, practical experience, field trips, challenges, practical experience from other participants, roundtable discussions, reflections, discussion, guest lectures, dinner in connection to guided tour, and concluded celebration.\r\n\r\nImpact on participants will be both knowledge development and implementation of new methods. We hope to contribute to a new way to interact in municipalities in order to achieve optimal living conditions for children and thus show how we can take advantage of each other's skills and minimize functionalistic organization.\r\n\r\nThe project will assist to further strengthen cooperation between our participating countries.

The young persons have the opportunity to have a look at their lives in the present and at future prospects in their region and/or in Europe. During this week a variety of creative and physical activities is provided, in which the young people can experience new competences and common activities as well as in which common wishes and feelings can be contributed.\r\n\r\nThe youth exchange is an excellent example of a long-term, trustful and well-working European cooperation with the aim to support young persons in the development of their personality in such a way that they make full use of their own potential and that they learn to build up self-confidence and motivation. It is accompanied and guided by educationalists who make it possible to experience intercultural learning and a European awareness by means of non-formal methods.

This adds value to the recycler, and provides manufacturers a rich source of useable recycled material at a local level.
