The exchange will last ten days, and will take place at Agon Coutainville in Normandy\r\n\r\n2017 will be marked by the presidential election in the United States, as well as in France. These two elections have in common the issues of immigration. While a daily drama is being played simultaneously on all borders and on all roads in Europe, an unprecedented challenge for the European Union, a source of indignation, polemics and proposals for the political class And commentators.\r\nOur movement has always been concerned about current issues, and today we want to respond to the YMCA youths' request to reflect on this issue.\r\nWith complementary profiles and backgrounds, people from immigrant backgrounds, people working with immigrants or students interested in issues related to migration flows (the question of asylum seekers, political and climate refugees, Integration or assimilation of immigrants, questions on European law on the free movement of persons (Schengen Area);\r\n\r\nYoung people will retrospectively examine the question of minorities and immigration in Europe, beginning with reflections by young people on their own country. Our objective is to sensitize, inform, understand and reflect on solutions that can be implemented on our scale in relation to our theme. We also want to encourage the encounter and sharing among young people from different countries and social backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe project will use intercultural learning methods (cooking workshop, language animation), with the aim of fostering communication between the participants. We will put in place a creative approach to informal learning with artistic means of presentation (photo, film, theater ...), and playful (teambuilding games) addressing issues related to minorities and immigration ... but Also in connection with subjects concerning young people: social problems such as poverty and unemployment. The young people will identify the differences between countries in order to encourage mutual understanding and to identify the points they have in common with their European peers.\r\nThe results of our work will be the subject of a conference at the end of our project in which we invite the local public figures, mayor, European deputies ...\r\n\r\nAs a result of this project, participants will develop transferable skills that can be used throughout life.\r\n- Communication, project planning, networking and decision making.\r\n-The acquisition of linguistic skills and ability to present themselves using different multimedia supports.\r\n- Working as a team.\r\n-The knowledge of other European countries and the different forms of democracy.\r\n-Computing: tolerance, respect, understanding, self-esteem and self-confidence.\r\n\r\nYoung people will therefore be encouraged to practice these new skills in their own country by presenting and explaining to their general public their experience in their youth center or their relatives.\r\nThe young people who participated in these debates and workshops in France will evolve from a passive role to an active role to become ambassadors of Europe.\r\nExhibitions will also serve as a means of expression for young Europeans and will circulate in the different centers of our partners in Europe. They will make it possible to spread the results of this exchange to a wider audience (other young people in residence, official figures ...).", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR02-KA105-012796_1"]]}}, "6RH": {"cordis": {"data": [[1433116800000, 1559260800000, "Advanced Lithium Sulphur battery for xEV", "Vayon Energy Storage Limited", "ALISE is a pan European collaboration focused on the development and commercial scale-up of new materials and on the understanding of the electrochemical processes involved in the lithium sulphur technology.

The project is focused to achieve 500 Wh/Kg stable LiS cell. The project involves dedicated durability, testing and LCA activities that will make sure the safety and adequate cyclability of battery being developed and available at competitive cost. Initial materials research will be scaled up during the project so that pilot scale quantities of the new materials will be introduced into the novel cell designs thus giving the following advancements over the current state of the art. The project approach will bring real breakthrough regarding new components, cell integration and architecture associated. New materials will be developed and optimized regarding anode, cathode, electrolyte and separator. Complete panels of specific tools and modelling associated will be developed from the unit cell to the batteries pack. Activities are focused on the elaboration of new materials and processes at TRL4. Demonstration of the lithium sulphur technology will be until batteries pack levels with validation onboard.
