Thus, users fail to access it efficiently and cannot exploit the underlying knowledge.<br/>The main objective of WeKnowIt is to develop novel techniques for exploiting multiple layers of intelligence from user-contributed content, which together constitute Collective Intelligence, a form of intelligence that emerges from the collaboration and competition among many individuals, and that seemingly has a mind of its own. To this end, input from various sources is analysed and combined: from digital content items and contextual information (Media Intelligence), massive user feedback (Mass Intelligence), and users social interaction (Social Intelligence) so as to benefit end-users (Personal Intelligence) and organizations (Organisational Intelligence).<br/>The automatic generation of Collective Intelligence constitutes a departure from traditional methods for information sharing, since for example, semantic analysis has to fuse information from both the content itself and the social context, while at the same time the social dynamics have to be taken into account. Such intelligence provides added-value to the available content and renders existing procedures and workflows more efficient.<br/>WeKnowIt will demonstrate the wide applicability of its achievements through the elaboration on two distinct case studies: an Emergency Response and a Consumers Social Group case study.

A significant reduction of emissions is expected by increasing efficiencies to \u014b > 50%. Currently, an efficiencies of 45% have been achieved in the last 30 years from subcritical 180 bar/540\u00baC to ultra-supercritical 300 bar/600-620\u00baC corresponding to a specific reduction of 20% of CO2 emissions.  Efficiencies of 50% and more can be achieved by further raising the temperature, but conventional ferritic steels are not sufficiently oxidation resistant, since the temperature designed for operation was 550\u00ba C. From the mechanical properties perspective, ferritic steels can be used at temperatures up to 650\u00ba C and for higher temperatures austenic steels and Ni base alloys are being considered. One of the main objectives of this project is therefore to develop advanced coatings for steam environments which can resist the chemical attack of steam and fireside corrosion at temperatures higher than 620\u00baC employing materials with the required high temperature mechanical properties  in particular creep strength. Ferritic\u2013martensitic steels will be considered as substrate materials for up to 650\u00ba C whereas, austenitic steels will be explored for higher temperatures.\nIn general higher temperatures mean higher oxidation rates, in particular when the oxidant is water vapour instead of oxygen.

Global competence includes acquiring the knowledge and awareness of global and intercultural issues, the ability to learn from and live with people from diverse backgrounds, the capacities for mutually respectful interaction and open and flexible attitudes. In recent patterns of cross-border migration into Europe, children have escaped poverty and war and now face the long struggle of adapting to life in a new country. Children in host countries also need adaptive skills to face the challenges and seize the opportunities that increased globalisation entails.\r\n\r\nFurther, in many European countries, attainment in mathematics is low, with many children reporting anxiety and lack of self-efficacy in the subject. Teaching strategies known to accelerate learning are less likely to be used with disadvantaged students and overall levels of attainment are negatively correlated with levels of disadvantage (OECD, Ten Questions for Mathematics Teachers\u2026 and How PISA Can Help Answer Them, 2016). There is a need to develop understanding of and skills in meaning-making, problem solving approaches to teaching mathematics in ways which promote confidence in and ownership of the subject, drawing on co-operative and collaborative approaches which children are known to enjoy. In addition, mathematical competence is needed in order to understand and interact as citizens in contemporary, complex societies. Research indicates that a key inhibitor to global learning is the need to focus on the core curriculum. PiCaM embeds critical global learning in the learning of mathematics, placing it at the heart of the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nPiCaM will provide pre- and in-service training in global learning and innovative, co-operative learning strategies in mathematics. It will provide materials to raise children's awareness of multiple perspectives and develop their critical thinking. Themes will include the global nature of mathematics; mathematics in history; ethno-mathematics; critical numeracy; and modelling contemporary social issues. For example, revealing the Hindu-Arabic roots of the number system; tiling in Islamic art; measures of well-being; using scale to understand migration. The processes used will emphasise learners working together to create a community of enquiry, one within which they experience rational and reasonable dialogue about things that matter to them and their teachers. Thus both the content and the pedagogy will support the knowledge, attitudes, dispositions and skills that are required for critical global learning within the teaching of mathematics. PiCaM will involve the use of eTwinning by children and teachers and the creation of children-led public exhibitions. It will result in nine intellectual outputs.\r\n\r\nTeachers (70) and children (2100) will use the materials and eTwinning activities. Children, parents and carers (500) and members of the local community (120) will attend the exhibitions with former acting as \"expert\" explainers. Pre-service students (150) will undertake training. Stake holders (30) will contribute through the advisory group and national start-up events; and families and children (5000) will learn about the project through visits to Mathematikum.\r\n\r\nPiCaM will promote\r\n\u2022 cultural inclusion and respect and the combatting of discrimination and racism through supporting teachers in promoting equity, inclusion and diversity\r\n\u2022 children's motivation, interest and self-efficacy (and thus their subsequent achievement) in mathematics.\r\nIt is expected to have a direct impact on the understanding, skills and practice of the pre-service students and their institutions and the practising teachers and their schools. It will impact on the learning experience of the children, increasing their motivation, interest and self-efficacy in mathematics through innovative, co-operative learning strategies, the introduction of multiple perspectives, P4C and critical thinking approaches.

Pulse Tidal, the holder of the IPR, has an improved technical approach and a refined strategy, which exploits the benefits of oscillating foils over wind turbine style axial flow rotors. Modelling has shown that high efficiencies can be achieved from a hydrofoil oscillating at certain frequencies. Scaled model testing by Pulse Tidal has confirmed that a phased pair of hydrofoils sweeping the same cross section of flow improves power capture efficiency to a level comparable with axial flow systems. The hydrofoil approach allows power to be captured with a wide, shallow swept area. In a given depth oscillating foil systems can be up to four times more powerful than single axial flow rotors. In reality almost all sites are too shallow for multi-megawatt axial flow rotors. By offering much larger unit capacities Pulse will have a unique strategic and economic advantage over other technologies.

Libraries have the choice between two ways of screening films: Either they set up an on-site library on the libraries\u2019 premises. For the on-site library AVA-Doc installs a local server and connect it physically local viewing stations. The librarys can also opt for a Video on Demand service which will be plugged into the libraries website. It allows library users to watch the films at home with their libraries\u2019 credentials. On-site and on-line libraries, are provided by the reelport GmbH. AVA is wining completely new audiences for European films. According to a 2013 EU-study, 97,3 mio citizens of the EU visited a library in the last 12 months. Many library users are socially weak (children, old people, immigrants) and not the typical audience of European films or even festivals. In AVA-Doc, libraries and festivals collaborate to gain these audiences for European film. AVA is a Win-Win-Win project: Festivals gain in visibility and audience \u2013 and they profit of their programming work even after the festival is over. Libraries might contribute to festival-financing throughout the year. Libraries are able to show films that they would never be able to show: Typically, European doc and short films have no DVD distribution nor are they available on commercial VoD services. Also, libraries profit of the competence in films build over the years by the festivals. The biggest benefactor is the audience: They can watch films that they have never been able to see before \u2013 and in mostly for free. AVA has begun as an Audience Development project for shorts in 2017 and continues with major doc festivals into 2018.", null, null, "creative_590757-CREA-1-2017-1-DE-MED-ONLINE3_3"], [1471219200000, 1502668800000, "MeetMarket and Alternate Realities Market", "INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENTARY FESTIVAL SHEFFIELD LTD", 111957.0, 1, 1, "Sheffield Doc/Fest\u2019s MeetMarket and Alternate Realities Market function together as a major funding, sales and distribution platform for match-made meetings designed to facilitate international business collaborations (ranging from development seed money, to commissions, co-pros and distribution) for the creation and exposure of non-fiction audio-visual works of both traditional (linear) as well as emerging digital formats.

The target group (over 55 years and not digitally literate) typically consists of individuals who have reached an advanced stage in their lives without learning to use any digital technology. Our approach will use touch-table games to introduce such individuals to digital interaction that provides confidence motivation and skills that can subsequently support exploratory-based learning of other digital technologies.  The approach will be to pilot and validate a new approach to learning digital skills that targets affective barriers to technology adoption as well as the cognitive and physical process of learning and skill acquisition.  Progression from initial exploration of a table-top application through the practical comprehension of system principles  to automatic competence and full literacy can be achieved through a combination of playful exploration and light guidance through engagement with games.   Players motivated to engage with games are effectively engaging in incremental learning about, for example, the behaviour of digital objects, the principles of object and area selection and the relationship between analogue metaphors and degrees of movement on digital space.  Helping and persuading participants to overcome reluctance is a priority as facilitating the cognitive progress of learning, and the playability, engagement and sociality of games is key to this strategy.    The use of the social dimension weakens resistance to educational activities that learners may be reluctant to engage in.  For older users this includes reversing a social stigma when contemplating digital technologies (where there is a sense of disenfranchisement, a sense that it is not \u2018their\u2019 technology).  The overlay of a sense of social activity through gaming is likely to produce behaviour change.  The mission of organisations such as The  UK and numerous regional online centres in the UK is to provide an environment that supports a positive approach to technology, as well as more instrumental help in overcoming difficulties.A threshold of 210 users and 35 individuals engaged in mentoring users in day centre environments will take part in two round of studies using touch-table games, followed by longitudinal monitoring of their progression to use of a wider range of digital utilities, principally using tablets. This will lead to the generation of a best-practice guide for promoting the approach to inspiring digital adoption for older users. This will disseminated in the three partner countries and trans-nationally through organizations concerned with promoting digital adoption for excluded citizens.The EU acknowledges the need for every citizen to have at least basic digital skills in order to participate in the modern society. Although the percentage of people online has increased rapidly in recent years we are now faced with the fact that there remains a percentage of people who for a combination of reasons are harder to reach and more difficult to provide with digital skills. Acquiring initial digital literacy involves learning basic manipulations, translating thoughts and intentions into specific input actions.  This is a skill that is learned through adoption, exploration and repeated practice.  The WIMP interfaces that are typical of the second generation of interactive systems have proved difficult to learn for many citizens.  Therefore our approach is to provide pathways to digital literacy that has playful and social interaction as a key first phase.  The gentle introduction gradually encourages exploratory learning of tools such as social network and communication, and more task-based applications such as e-mail, form filling and manipulating security features.  This may be by transferring learned and practiced competence not interaction with tablets (in order to exploit touch and manipulation skill acquired through game play).   This segmentation of the learning process allows the acquisition of key interaction and exploratory-learning skills based on ludic engagement. This will build up digital confidence and familiarity with touch interfaces, and removes the stigma associated with digital technology, using ludic engagement to positively reinforce familiarity and confidence the technology.  Furthermore it helps to redefine the role of those who are charged with mentoring and helping those individuals, by redefining the nature of learning.  It is anticipated that the work will disseminate best-practice through its relationships with practitioner organizations established at EU level and in three of the partner countries (UK, Austria, Slovenia) where organizations targeting wider digital participation already exist.

As a result of this motionless and being lazy, people don\u2019t even cook for themselves, but prefer unhealthy and easy food like fast food. The number of these young people is increasing day by day.

In addition, the most recent Eurostat figures, show there are more than 17 million citizens switched their country of birth within the EU. Conflicts in the Middle East and lack of safe places for living and working are forcing more refugees to seek safety in  EU.\r\nAccording to UNHCR stats, there are nearly 5 million Syrian refugees registered who are displaced or changed their location because of the Syrian crisis which started in March 2011.  Today, one of the most important problems faced by the refugees living in other countries is access to the education. In total, Human Rights Watch indicates in its report that there are 3 000 0000 Syrian children who cannot go to school. The current EU politics in practice are giving little consideration to their vulnerabilities and needs as children. Even the EU-Turkey Agreement clearly says that \u201cdue account must be paid to the situation of vulnerable groups, in particular, unaccompanied minors for whom all decisions must be in their best interests\u201d.

Instead, they face with big cultural shock and trauma caused by obstacles to accessing education, lack of acceptance, affection, participation, language understanding and etc. It\u2019s time for efforts to be invested in prevention before they get to the age that frustration booms and they decide to do extremist things. \r\nWe believe that this situation can be improved by developing non-formal learning methods and pedagogical approaches which will be put into practice by the youth workers who are working with young refugees on a daily basis in the refugee camps where the young refugees are mostly situated.  Because of their current situation, the best way for their integration is through the non-formal learning methods, where through interactive activities they will socialize with other people, will learn new things and will learn the language of the country. \r\nAlso, various researchers have shown that if people have positive and enriching experiences with other cultures than they are more likely to embrace diversity.

Commercial aviation can be protected from the threat of explosives by : 1. preventing explosives from reaching the aircraft  2. mitigating the effects of an explosive protecting the aircraft from an onboard explosion. The risk that a small quantity of an explosive, below the threshold of the detection instruments, could get undetected should be considered, and the introduction of contermeasures to reduce the effects of on-board explosions should be considered.  This is the idea behind FLY-BAG.  Hardened containers (HULD) have been developed for the latter scope, but have some disadvantages which prevent their wider utilisation: they are heavier and more costly than standard luggage containers and only applicable to wide-body aircrafts. The issue of containing explosions aboard narrow-body aircraft must be resolved.  Our concept is based on the development of flexible textile-based luggage containers able to resist a small to medium explosion by controlled expansion and containment of the shock waves whilst, at the same time, preventing hard luggage fragment projectiles (shrapnel) from striking the main structure of the aircraft at high speed.  A multi-layered 'soft-sandwich' structure is required to absorb the large dynamic loads of the explosion and the large deformation related to the gas expansion. Our idea is to use a multi-axial textile structures made of ballistic yarns as an internal high strength layer, coupled with an external 'foldable' layer which could deform in a controlled way during the explosion, in a way similar to air-bags in cars.

Global competence includes acquiring the knowledge and awareness of global and intercultural issues, the ability to learn from and live with people from diverse backgrounds, the capacities for mutually respectful interaction and open and flexible attitudes. In recent patterns of cross-border migration into Europe, children have escaped poverty and war and now face the long struggle of adapting to life in a new country. Children in host countries also need adaptive skills to face the challenges and seize the opportunities that increased globalisation entails.\r\n\r\nFurther, in many European countries, attainment in mathematics is low, with many children reporting anxiety and lack of self-efficacy in the subject. Teaching strategies known to accelerate learning are less likely to be used with disadvantaged students and overall levels of attainment are negatively correlated with levels of disadvantage (OECD, Ten Questions for Mathematics Teachers\u2026 and How PISA Can Help Answer Them, 2016). There is a need to develop understanding of and skills in meaning-making, problem solving approaches to teaching mathematics in ways which promote confidence in and ownership of the subject, drawing on co-operative and collaborative approaches which children are known to enjoy. In addition, mathematical competence is needed in order to understand and interact as citizens in contemporary, complex societies. Research indicates that a key inhibitor to global learning is the need to focus on the core curriculum. PiCaM embeds critical global learning in the learning of mathematics, placing it at the heart of the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nPiCaM will provide pre- and in-service training in global learning and innovative, co-operative learning strategies in mathematics. It will provide materials to raise children's awareness of multiple perspectives and develop their critical thinking. Themes will include the global nature of mathematics; mathematics in history; ethno-mathematics; critical numeracy; and modelling contemporary social issues. For example, revealing the Hindu-Arabic roots of the number system; tiling in Islamic art; measures of well-being; using scale to understand migration. The processes used will emphasise learners working together to create a community of enquiry, one within which they experience rational and reasonable dialogue about things that matter to them and their teachers. Thus both the content and the pedagogy will support the knowledge, attitudes, dispositions and skills that are required for critical global learning within the teaching of mathematics. PiCaM will involve the use of eTwinning by children and teachers and the creation of children-led public exhibitions. It will result in nine intellectual outputs.\r\n\r\nTeachers (70) and children (2100) will use the materials and eTwinning activities. Children, parents and carers (500) and members of the local community (120) will attend the exhibitions with former acting as \"expert\" explainers.

Stake holders (30) will contribute through the advisory group and national start-up events; and families and children (5000) will learn about the project through visits to Mathematikum.\r\n\r\nPiCaM will promote\r\n\u2022 cultural inclusion and respect and the combatting of discrimination and racism through supporting teachers in promoting equity, inclusion and diversity\r\n\u2022 children's motivation, interest and self-efficacy (and thus their subsequent achievement) in mathematics.\r\nIt is expected to have a direct impact on the understanding, skills and practice of the pre-service students and their institutions and the practising teachers and their schools. It will impact on the learning experience of the children, increasing their motivation, interest and self-efficacy in mathematics through innovative, co-operative learning strategies, the introduction of multiple perspectives, P4C and critical thinking approaches. It will also increase the knowledge and awareness of global learning of the children, their parents and carers and members of the local community.\r\n\r\nThe conceptual and methodological principles of PiCaM are likely to inform similar future work in a wider European context and to impact on pre-service  students in subsequent years at the institutions involved and more widely and teacher educators who find out about the project through multiplier events, conference papers and other research and professional publications. It is likely that the materials and approaches will be adopted by other institutions. It is anticipated that the curriculum materials will be widely used in all partner countries following the end of the project, supported by multiplier events, professional publications, the website, liaison with key stakeholders and internet circulation.", "http://www.decsy.org.uk", "SHEFFIELD HALLAM UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036675_1"]]}}}}
