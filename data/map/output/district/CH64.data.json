We combine intercultural activities with sail training activities. The Sail Training and the other activities are all directed towards that goal.  Sailing the Gulden Leeuw, means that we as participants will become responsible for sailing and operating the vessel. In all aspects we are discovering new things.\r\n\r\nBy living and working together in an international team will not only bring awareness of the cultural diversity on the ship, but also prove adaptability and tolerance for each participant.  Sea going vessels are a very particular environment that puts everything someone may know into a different perspective. Being away from usual surroundings and people, will force the participants to actively make new marks within the group as they would do in other \"known\" circumstances.\r\n\r\n58 participants will be joining the project from 8 European countries : the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, France, Finland, Malta, United Kingdom and Hungary. The young people will have to live and work together as a team in a confined area (the ship) with limited resources as they will have to adapt to different cultures, personalities and surroundings. In real life tasks, which is the strength of the program.\r\n\r\nThe participants are a mixed group, not only in nationalities, but also in backgrounds. We explicitly want to include youngsters with financial difficulties, from geographical isolated areas , with health problems and or handicaps. We believe that a democratic society should be about including all people, everybody can contribute to society in their own special way. The vessel with its great variety of tasks is a great environment to learn that we are all needed and all can contribute to our end goal; to sail the vessel and organize a great exchange program.  \r\n\r\nThe main activity (with many tasks and challenges) is learning to sail the Gulden Leeuw.  Facing challenges and solving issues will be a daily competence that participants will need on board. For some participants, embarking on a ship is a challenge itself. For other participants, the first challenge will be to face many unknown people from different countries. Communication can be a challenge when a manoeuvre has to be made and there are five different languages in the team. Climbing the rigging and steering the ship. Participants will have to face challenges every day and solve problems together in order to get to the end of the activity and destination.  The results from the past show that crossing so many (personal) boundaries have a very positive effect on perseverance and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nThe other cultural exchange activities are all chosen, because of their intensifying effect on the cultural learning process. They will foster the discussions,  address important topics the participants face in everyday life and or challenge the participants in developing new attitudes towards others and themselves.  \r\n\r\nThe program will have a huge impact on the participants; they will develop many new competences, like teamwork, leadership, taking up challenges. More important they will change their attitudes, not only towards themselves with a believe they can do much more them they thought, but also to others. They will have learned that the similarities are more important than the differences and there is always something in common with another person.  They will leave the vessel with new views and more self-confident. \r\n\r\nSo, in short: we would like to carry out this project for European youngsters to develop new competence and skills through an unique and active experience that will also help them develop their individual personality and the world they live in.", "http://www.mastcharity.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-DK01-KA105-004011_6"], [2015, "Sail Training Ireland Youth Development Project", "Merseyside Adventure Sailing Trust", 32278.0, 2, 2, "Context/BackgroundSail Training Ireland (STIRL) has been running Youth Exchange and other programmes using Sailing Voyages on Tall Ships as a platform for non-formal learning on an annual basis since 2012.

Our voyage brings from Gothenburg (Sweden) to Blyth (The United Kingdom) and back to Gothenburg.  On board we combine intercultural learning activities with sail training. These methods combined and the aid of several mentors (one from each country) will make this an intense and successful program.  The 36 participants from Sweden, Malta, Denmark and the United Kingdom are in for a life changing journey towards personal development, cultural awareness and international friendship. At least half of the group will consists of youngsters facing some sort of challenge in their daily lives, be that medical problems or being economically or geographically disadvantaged. As said we will combine sail training activities with intercultural learning. The combination of these two is the strength of this program. Our general working method, both in the sail training activities as well as the intercultural learning activities, is strongly based on the principles of experiential learning. The sail training requires participants to confront many demanding challenges, both physical and emotional. It inspires self-confidence and the acceptance of personal responsibility.  It promotes an acceptance of others whatever their social or cultural backgrounds, and develops a willingness to take controlled risks. Sail training includes instruction in all aspects of sailing but its purpose goes far, far beyond this. Sail training uses the experience of being at sea principally as a means to help people learn about themselves, discover hidden strengths and talents and understand the value of working as a team. Both the crew and the mentors are experienced with the Sail Training Program.The Sail Training and working/living together alone already works towards the main objectives of this project, namely given the participating youngsters the opportunity to develop themselves and learn about other cultures. To enhance this objectives even further, we will combine the Sail Training with daily intercultural learning activities, both during our time at sea and when we are in port. Example of these activities are Country Presentations, group discussions, teambuilding games  and creative assignments, all executed with our general theme of a Joint European Future kept in mind.These activities help structure the things the participants are already learning from merely working together, and thus strengthen their learning experience. They are not only being told about certain aspects of a country in for example the Country Presentations, but also experience the difference on a daily basis and when exploring the cities and cultures of Gothenburg and Blyth Combining the practical Sail Training with the exchange activities also makes for a wide range of challenges and possibilities for the participants to develop themselves. Climbing a mast might be no big deal for some, but may be for them giving a talk about their country is a very big challenge. This way, we cater for all and maximize everybody\u2019s learning outcome.Participants are expected to improve their team working skills and  become more aware of their abilities, strengths and weaknesses, both physically, mentally and linguistically, thus increasing their self-confidence and improving their social skills. Because of the culturally diverse environment of the exchange, participants will grow awareness for cultural differences and similarities, and understanding for differences in values and norms. For example, the contact and living with a person with some sort of physical disability or someone from a really remote area really changes the opinion of youngsters that have never met people with such backgrounds before.  When the participants return home after the exchange, their respective organizations and the others within that organization will see their progress. Their newly acquired competences will not only benefit themselves, but also the members of the partner organizations.  After similar previous exchanges, it turned out that many former participants stay active in organizing projects and programs for themselves and other young people, for example by becoming mentors.It is to be expected that the development of the participants will last for a long time, which is likely to inspire the participants to be more internationally active, seek for ways to inspire others or to be more involved in international organizations or communities.", "http://www.mastcharity.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-SE02-KA105-001413_3"], [2014, "Skagen Explorers; Challenging Ourselves to discover Cultural Identities in Europe", "Merseyside Adventure Sailing Trust", 19370.0, 5, 5, "Skagen Explorers: Challenging Ourselves to Discover Cultural Identities and Ourselves in Europe.\r\n\r\nThis inter-cultural project at sea will bring together 38 youths from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom to discover the Skagen waters and harbours through the eyes of seamen and coastal communities living in the North of Denmark and surrounding areas.
