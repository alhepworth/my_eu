EU exports have expanded by 4.7% p.a. over 2000-2008 and in some sectors the EU has increased its share of world exports between 1996 and 2006, notably in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and motor vehicles. SMEs represent 99% of the EU manufacturing sector equating to over 2.5 million companies. As manufacturing is resource intensive both in terms of raw materials and energy consumption, despite rising costs (energy and raw materials) SMEs are under increasing threat to remain competitive against non-EU based companies.\n\nThe aim of the ICARUS project is to create an absorption power generation technology for low temperature (60-120oC) heat. This will enable us to create a waste-heat power generation system for industrial (chemical, cement etc.) applications that can achieve an efficiency of up to 20% for electricity to be generated from industrial waste heat (<120oC) without affecting industrial processes. By doing this, the absorption power generation system created will offer greatly improved environmental performance due to improved efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions at a cost that is affordable to the end-user. This will lead to significant economic and societal benefits to manufacturers.

If they are unable to achieve targets, then this may have a significant negative impact on manufacturers. Cars also produce emissions such as Nitrogen oxides, Hydrocarbons, Carbon monoxide and particulate matter which are subject to tight controls. For marine application, existing and forthcoming legislation is aiming at reducing the emissions of Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbons and particulate matter. In addition, concerns about rising fuel costs are driving the need for greater fuel efficiencies. As a result, a disruptive technology step is required that will enable the manufactures or cars and marine engines to meet the forthcoming legislative standards. One very attractive way of achieving this is to generate power from the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) waste heat.\nA prototype system created by BMW can generate up to 250W of electricity under normal driving conditions that can cut fuel consumption by up to 2%. However, the thermo-electric materials used for these applications to date have a number of clear limitations as they can be easily thermally damaged, are expensive and only achieve low efficiencies.\nThe POWER DRIVER project aims to overcome the limitations relating to the production of an automotive and marine power generation system by integrating cutting-edge nano-structured silicide and functionally graded telluride thermo-electric materials into a heat exchanger assembly that will enable electrical power to be generated from the exhaust system without affecting back-pressure or engine balance. By doing this, the exhaust system created will offer greatly improved environmental performance due to improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions (CO2, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulates) at a cost that is affordable to the end-user.
