They acquire and convey knowledge of European history and presence, in particular on the violent felonies of the 20th century and their preconditions - and of the core values on which we build and continue to form our present and future Europe. They very practically campaign against exclusion and discrimination in our time and reflect on options for action that contribute to a pluralistic, participative and solidaric society. Through their service the volunteers in a practical and very concrete way support people who themselves have had to experience violence or discrimination. Furthermore the volunteers contribute knowledge and experiences from their home countries to their partners involved and also in that respect support them to gain a more differenciated knowledge on existing narratives and on the social reality in the societies of their respective origin.", "http://www.asf-ev.de", null, "erasmus_2016-2-DE04-KA105-014375_10"]]}}}}
