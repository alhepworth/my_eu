It is thought that the UK\u2019s dune area has been reduced to 30 % of that present in 1900, and in England the losses are closer to 50 %. Natural England manages nine National Nature Reserves (covering 954 ha) that have sand dune habitats of European importance. The project takes place across eight Natura 2000 network sites (SACs), which contain a total of 3 412 ha of all seven Habitats Directive Annex 1 sand dune habitat types present in England. The latest UK Article 17 report on the implementation of the Directive states that these habitats are in an overall \u2018unfavourable-bad\u2019 conservation status and that this has reached a critical point. The approaches outlined in the IPENS (LIFE11 NAT/UK/000384) project provide a basis for future work.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=6812", null, "life_62"]]}}}}
