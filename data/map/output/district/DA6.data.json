The close link of College education and training at work places in the local area and at European partner places will improve the quality of training of Ritterplan College trainees. Moreover, it will strengthen the cooperation and exchange of knowledge of education in Early Childhood, Health and Social Care and Youth Work among its staff.\r\nExcept for one workplace (The Concord Hotel) all partner institutions deal with the care and education of children, young people and adults with and without learning disabilities. Here the participants will learn about different care work methods and their underlying concepts and get the opportunity to pracise them in every day routines. The staff from G\u00f6ttingen Youth Service will cooperate with European partners and promote the process of non-formal learning and enhance quality improvements in youth work in Europe. All learning project participants will be instructed and monitored by skilled host mentors at each of the European partner workplaces and additionally by link tutors of Ritterplan College by regular visits and email contact.\r\nPartnership agreements and the description of learning outcomes for Early Years trainees in their 1st year of training, EQF 6,  have already been made. Learning outcomes for Health and Social Care trainees and employees for the Hotel and Restaurant Service will be described within this project. Ritterplan College aims to promote the transparency and recognition of skills and qualifications to support the free movement of workers for job purposes or further learning in Europe. Moreover, due to the increasing internationalization of the labour market Ritterplan College hopes that all of the project participants will be able to foster international skills  and improve their professional, linguistic, intercultural and personal competences. \r\n\r\nAfter the participants\u00b4 return their results will be evaluated and disseminated on special events, conferences and governors\u00b4  meetings in the G\u00f6ttingen area and on the homepage of Ritterplan College. The project results will trigger discussions and help to develop reforms in the vocational education and training in the field of Early Childhood, Health and Social Care, Youth Work and the Hotel and Restaurant Business.\r\nAll participants will develop a better understanding for the linguistic and cultural diversity in Europe and increase their motivation to initiate innovative projects and to open themselves to new ideas and contribute to growth and productivity. During their stay abroad they will get to know different political systems, put them in relation with each other, evaluate them and learn to play an active role in enhancing social inclusion in Europe.", "http://www.bexley.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-001821_2"]]}}, "8LQ": {"nhs": {"data": [["RPG", "Upton Day Hospital", "nhs_RPGDJ"]]}}}}
