We recognise that our pupils require a new skill set as they enter an ever-evolving, ever-demanding global job market; but more than that, they need the transversal skills that will enable them to act as entrepreneurs, who will provide the innovative spark to create new jobs & bring new wealth to their communities.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, we recognise the need to 'upskill' our teachers in the delivery of  a more open-ended, activity-based, experiential approach to learning, to enable our children to develop these skills.

We want to develop a nursery with children's play at its heart. A vibrant nursery, bubbling over with daily adventures, imagination, creativity, curiosity, ingenuity, exploration, challenge and fun. A secure home, away from home, where children 'Play to Learn'. \r\n\r\nWe believe that children learn best through open-ended play, and place great value on their acquisition of the so called, 'soft skills' of collaboration, concentrating, resilience, using one's own initiative, questioning, testing, risk taking, taking responsibility for one's own actions, empathy etc. These 'soft skills' are the foundations, upon which, all future learning will be built.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a new provider, we are aware of our relative inexperience and the need to develop our professional skills and competences as early years practitioners. We need to learn when and how to intervene and interact with the children to enrich their learning experiences.  We also need to develop and enhance our skills and competences in the organisation, management and day-to-day running of our nursery unit.\r\n\r\nTo that end, we have applied for an Erasmus+ KA1 grant to enable us to achieve our objectives for our pupils' learning, for our staff's professional development and the effective operation of our nursery unit. Our partners in Greece and Estonia are applying simultaneously for a similar KA1 grant. \r\n\r\nWe propose to send six members of staff, chosen from our Senior Management and Early Years' Teams to International Conferences in Iceland and Spain, around the theme of Play-based Learning. It is hoped that the training and knowledge our staff receive will inspire and empower them to take forward this innovative play-based approach to the curriculum.\r\n\r\nThey will further investigate a play-based, experiential approach to learning, by travelling to pre-schools in Greece and Estonia, to observe best practice; to shadow colleagues; to team teach with them; to learn together in workshops around pre-agreed themes; and to enter into a professional dialogue with their staff. \r\n\r\nWe believe that, our participation in this international learning community will help us develop as early years practitioners and will provide a creative force in our pre-school, transforming and enriching our children's learning experiences, empowering them, developing their self-esteem and promoting positive attitudes as they \u2018Play to Learn\u2019. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we believe that our more experienced partners from Greece and Estonia, will benefit from reciprocal visits to Northern Ireland, and that together we will enhance the International profile of our schools.

On one hand, it launches a series of actions directed to teaching staff, so that through the realization of job shadows (three mobilities at homologous centers in Ireland and France), they can learn the strategies and methodologies of other educational systems and incorporate them into the teaching practice in the JC1. The other aspect is that of carrying out 10 students' mobilities in two modalities: short stays (FCT) and ErasmusPro, which will allow them to carry out work placements to improve their professional skills in companies of the respective fields in Italy, Holland and Portugal.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the project will allow the educational community of our center to:\r\n\r\n- Increase the quality of Vocational Training Education by comparing educational systems in different countries and applying new techniques that improve professional profiles, fostering the optimal development of professional skills.\r\n\r\n- Develop the professional, personal and social skills of students in the international arena. Undoubtedly teamwork and coordination with European partners will be key to achieving the objectives, enhancing professional profiles and giving them meaning.\r\n\r\n- Offer opportunities to eliminate social inequalities for socially disadvantaged students who, thanks to the project, can reorient their future to find the necessary support for it.\r\n\r\n- Enhance the personal and social growth of the participants through cultural and linguistic immersion in other European societies, while at the same time developing respect, tolerance and equality.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this project on our institution will be the updating and innovation of methods, which will increase the quality of the teaching. It will also increase the motivation of students, which will improve their professionalism and allow them to be more competitive in the workplace. Thus, the JC1 will have a differentiating element from other institutions: it will incorporate new European-level methodologies into Vocational Training Education.\r\n\r\nAt the regional level, the results of the project will have an impact on companies in the professional fields of Chemistry and People in Need of Care, since promotion of our center and the participants through the project will result in developing interest in the hiring of our students and, in general, of collaborating with our educational center.\r\n\r\nAt the national level, the project promotes the development of the personal and social resources of our students in the search for employment. The diffusion of the impact of this project will reinforce the image of IES JC1 in the Murcia region, as well as on a national scope.\r\n\r\nAt the European level, the increase in contacts with companies will be important for future collaborations and exchange of experiences, as well as learning mobilities. The achievement of collaborations with educational centers as project partners will directly affect our teaching practice, giving it a European dimension.
