The project responds to these needs through the fusion of STEM, Entrepreneurship and gender-sensitive Education and the development of a state-of-the-art professional development training programme targeting pre-service, in-service teachers and students of teacher education. To do this, it implements the innovative pedagogy of STEMitUP at European level and builds on the cooperation between universities, science museums, NGOs, SMEs and European networks.\r\n\r\n\u201cSTEMitUP\u201d refers to the idiom \u201cSpice it up\u201d that means \u201cmake something more interesting or exciting\u201d. STEMitUP aims at filling STEM teachers\u2019 quiver with innovative and fun pedagogical tools and adding an entrepreneurial layer to STEM education will help youth apply STEM to solve real-world problems, to think creatively and to benefit their communities. STEMitUP activities will give emphasis to innovation and meeting society\u2019s future needs, while stimulating the entrepreneurial mindsets of boys and girls equally so that they start thinking seriously about choosing STEM entrepreneurship as the best possible career.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to:\r\n\u25aaImprove teacher training in the area of STEM entrepreneurship;\r\n\u25aaDevelop students\u2019 skills related to STEM entrepreneurship subjects;\r\n\u25aaPromote the increased participation of girls and other groups of learners at special risk of exclusion from scientific and entrepreneurial studies and careers by adopting an inclusive STEM entrepreneurship education model;\r\n\u25aaEncourage sharing of experiences from all partners across Europe to identify best practices for the incorporation of ideas related to science, technology and entrepreneurship in STEM classrooms and in teacher education;\r\n\u25aaFoster a mutually beneficial relationship between research communities in STEM entrepreneurship subjects, teacher networks and local education systems for the on-going advancement of the disciplines;\r\n\u25aaFacilitate the widespread dissemination and sustainability of resources and innovative pedagogical approaches to the wider EU community and internationally.\r\n\r\nThe main activities of the project are:\r\n\u25aaMapping of best practices at national, European and international level;\r\n\u25aaDevelopment of STEMitUP activities for teachers and students;\r\n\u25aaDevelopment of pedagogical material related to the STEMitUP activities;\r\n\u25aaDefinition of a methodological framework for \u201cfun\u201d as a founding element of work;\r\n\u25aaOrganisation of training events for teachers to create the conditions for the implementation of STEMitUP pedagogy and activities;\r\n\u25aaOrganisation of multiplier events to widely disseminate the activities;\r\n\u25aaCoordination, management and monitoring of project activities and budget.\r\n\r\nPartners will work on the basis of a detailed plan of activities, tasks, objectives and deadlines monitored by the project coordinator, the project\u2019s \u201ccritical friend\u201d and specific output and task leaders.

Partners wish to develop and enhance learners' views of themselves as contributing European citizens and to enable them to share their lives, languages, education and communities via a range of mediums in an enjoyable, productive and meaningful manner whilst collaborating and sharing experiences with their peers in other countries.For staffs the aim is to promote good teaching practice within Partner Schools and the University and the dissemination of this practice to a wider audience. Opportunities for staff mobilities will be maximized in order to enhance the relationships between staffs and develop the wider European perspective in their operational curricular.

These practices will be taken into account in the ECVET process.\r\nThe students will do some cultural and heritage visits outside working hours.  Non formal learning outcomes will be developped on their different places of accomodation (for example alongside their host families). These situations will enable them to be more autonomous and responsible, and to get them more interested in learning languages. The participants will then be able to open up to different cultures, realities and customs\u2026\r\nIn order to run this project, we set up a consortium. Eighteen VET schools work together and share their practices. The Federation of Maisons Familiales Rurales of Bourgogne and Franche-Comt\u00e9, in partnership with the DAREIC, coordinate the project. Several coordination meetings are held all along the project. Different tasks have been established in order to enable the sending organisations (VET schools) to focus on the students who will carry out a work placement with Erasmus +.\r\n The project will have an impact on various levels : an individual impact on the sending organisations, but also at a regional and national level. A promotion of the project is planned in all VET schools in order to allow everyone to share their results and experiences. To promote the project, public events take place most of the time, leading the largest number of people to know more about the impact of this project. An ambitious dissemination plan has been set up to widely communicate on the project, and to value the young people, as well as their activities.\r\n Several meetings will be held regionally, such as awarding ceremonies that will have an impact at a regional level. The Regional Federation is part of a working group at a national level. It is currently working on other projects that are more strategic. This in order to get a long-term impact, and to provide other projects to all the members of the consortium.", "http://auditechnik.net", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046130_29"]]}}}}
