All participants attend or have just finished (from no more than one year) a vocational  and training path in the field of tourism services and who will carry out the relevant professional work experience abroad.\r\nRENADRION intends, therefore, offer young people experience in companies of their field of study that includes the ability to deal with the language skills possessed and the acquisition of specific job competencies. It aims, in particular, to align the learning outcomes achieved in the education and training path with the needs of the labor market in the field of promotion and management of tourism and enhance the knowledge of the development strategies adopted in other contexts in the field of interest, using the internship experience as a fundamental part of the training.\r\nAmong the general objectives of the project:\r\n- Promote lifelong learning as a right of the persons to increase and update their skills, abilities and knowledge in formal, non formal and informal learning contexts;\r\n- Promote the transparency of learning and compliance training to the needs of businesses and professions in order to facilitate the meeting between demand and supply of labor and increase the productivity and competitiveness of the production system;\r\n- Enlarge the marketability of qualifications at national and EU level in order to facilitate geographical and occupational mobility also in terms of the internationalization of businesses and professions.\r\nMobility experiences will increase also the soft skills of the participants, such as the spirit of initiative, adaptability and the ability to relate and interact with cultural backgrounds different from their own.\r\nThe transparency of learning in the tourism sector will be guaranteed, finally, through ECVET and the establishment of a partnership able to work on mutual understanding on units of learning outcomes and method of evaluation, validation and recognition of knowledge, skills and competencies achieved by participants in mobility.\r\nThese, therefore, the expected impacts:\r\n- The development of specialized skills of the target groups involved (210 young students and recent graduates);\r\n- Set up of training models and tools of innovative value;\r\n- Diffusion of results and training models between stakeholders in the macro sector concerned and in the VET systems;\r\n- Make available the results and training models for institutions and professionals of local/regional level.\r\nThe project can therefore be considered exemplary, being integrated into the strategic development of each partner in the consortium, as well as transferable outside of it, for different reasons:\r\n- It represents the effective realization of a model of WORK BASED LEARNING with a system of actions aimed at specific training, but also at the global growth of the person.

It is, in fact, over 10% of EU GDP (including the linked industries) and employs 9.7 million people and 1.8 million companies. In our country, the industry has, as a whole, about 191.000 businesses and, on 31st  December 2015, 886.000 employees, while in the two regions covered by the project (Sicily and Calabria), between 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, employment in the tourism sector has recorded an average increase compared to 2013-2014, by 3.8% in Sicily and 2.7% in Calabria. The data and projections show, however, on the one hand, the expansion of the sector and the tourist attractiveness of the two regions and, on the other hand, emphasize the need to provide trained young staff, highly qualified and able to respond positively to new and high competence requested by the local labor market.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy and ET 2020, WORK AWAY offers young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies: professionalism in the specific sector of TOURISM, soft skills, cultural knowledge and language skills. These general objectives are pursued through a mobility experience which consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 STUDENTS attending CLASSES IV and of 3 months for 80 newly graduated of the 8 participating VET Schools (Technical Institutes for Tourism and Hotel and Catering Schools). The project also promotes the exchange and transfer of good practices in VET by relating our VET system with the training and employment system to other European countries and contributes to the consolidation of the ECVET System.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY\r\n1. Transversal Activities: management and coordination; Dissemination and exploitation of results; Follow up;\r\n2. Mobility Preparation: Plan of communication and cooperation; Recruitment and selection of participants; preparation of participants; Learning plan definition;\r\n3. Mobility Realization: Internship in the company; Monitoring and tutoring; Project feedback and experience of mobility; Assessment, certification and validation of skills acquired.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY in 4 PHASES\r\n1. MANAGEMENT PLAN AND MONITORING: the project is coordinated by IIS \"Moncada\" in close collaboration with other 16 partners of the Consortium. The Plan is based on the EQAVET quality system and includes specification on: financial arrangements, timing, names of managers / representatives of each organization, responsibilities, roles and tasks, project phases with related milestones, risk management procedures.\r\n2. PLAN OF LEARNING AND EVALUATION: the learning and evaluation plan contains specific references and commitments on transparency and recognition of competences in an ECVET-compatible framework. The documents are: Learning Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The quality of the experience of mobility is controlled through regular evaluation questionnaires filled out by participants, mentors and tutors.\r\n3. PLAN OF COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION: it provides for the involvement of all participants in the partnership with effective tools and rules to maintain a high level of interest on the project.\r\n4. STRATEGIC PLAN FOR DISSEMINATION AND EXPLOITATION: includes phases and methods to be adopted by all partners to disseminate and exploit the project and its results all over the duration and behond.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS\r\na. The development of highly specific and innovative skills in the tourism and catering sector;\r\nb. More competitive and greater employment opportunities in the labor market for the participants;\r\nc. The development and innovation of VET systems.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nThe project includes a significant impact on the VET Systems through: learning outcomes achievement of participants to mobility; skills acquired from the staff involved in the project; recognition of skills in an ECVET-compatible framework. It represents also an added value and development opportunity for the participating organizations, which will consolidate a new training segment to complete the technical and vocational education and answer the demand of enterprises of high professional skills.\r\n\r\nLONG-TERM BENEFITS\r\nIn the long term, thanks to the dissemination tools developed and to the size and importance of the consortium, it is expected to have a multiplier effect both regionally, and at national and EU level and the orientation of public policies on the base of the results of the project, using in addition, as a standard model, all procedures and best practices developed within the Project.", "http://www.crownspahotel.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005725_8"], [2016, "LEO quali-TC ECVET ENLARGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY", "Crown Spa Hotel", 472814.0, 7, 39, "Due to the economic crisis, the problem of integrating young people into the labor market has taken on a character of emergency - as the unemployment rate for the aged 15-24 reached more than 44% - and it is, therefore, widely believed that it is necessary to foster experiences of integration into the production system since the years of education and training.Recent economic developments have shown, moreover, the need, in a global context, of a highly skilled workforce. As the labor market becomes increasingly international, Europe, and thus also our country, needs education and training paths that fully respond to these challenges. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of education and vocational training. This would help learners to reach high level qualifications, fundamental for a first successful inclusion in the labor market or to the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programs are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU Member States have recently set a target of allowing at least 6% of all learners in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through \"LEO quali-TC STRATEGY\", IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" and the other seven VET Schools involved, look at improving the quality of education and vocational training giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills and curriculum: professionalism in the specific areas of Tourism and Catering, cultural knowledge and language training. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 students in initial vocational training and of 3 months for 64 recently graduated learners. The project intends to combine, also, the training period required by the new national legislation related the \u201cAlternanza Scuola-Lavoro\u201d (for a minimum of 400 hours in the last three years of school) to an internship abroad.On the base of the idea to continue to exploit the results of the LLP-LdV TOI Project \u201cLEO quali-TC\u201d (promoted by IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" in 2013 and recently completed), but also promoting the sustainability and enlargement Strategy of ECVET in the field of Tourism and Catering at national and European level, LEO-TC STRATEGY aims also to meet the needs of participating schools, trainers in the tourism and catering industry, companies and stakeholders of the Consortium, supporting and guiding them through the process of ECVET implementation, strengthening synergies and transitions between areas of formal and non formal learning, employment and entrepreneurship and ensuring better recognition of the skills and competencies acquired during periods of learning abroad.From the methodological point of view the project includes:- The continuous and active involvement of all the figures of the project staff and the supervision carried out by trainers and mentors; tutoring and mentoring activities; training methods based on the involvement, participation, the high integration between theory and practice, the development of practical skills immediately spendable, the validation of acquired skills;- A system of midterm and final means to monitor progress in terms of learning achieved by the participants, as well as to evaluate, certify, validate and transfer them within the ECVET framework;- The development of a final report focused on the identification of the effective functioning of the activities and elements that can be reproduced, transferred and integrated within the consortium and in other contexts.The following, therefore, the expected impacts:- Development of specialized skills of the target groups involved (160 young students and recent graduates);- Creation of models and training tools of innovative value;- Diffusion of results and training models among the subjects of the macro sectors concerned and vocational training - Availability of results and training models for institutions and professionals of the local / regional territories involved- Orientation of the public policies of the partners involved on the basis of the results of the project;- Use of procedures such as a standard model.", "http://www.crownspahotel.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-004985_34"], [2016, "EUBET", "Crown Spa Hotel", 402452.0, 8, 39, "Bromangymnasiet in Hudiksvall is situated in a region of very high unemployment, among the young it is the highest percentage in the country (25 %).

This is why the twin towns Scarborough and Ostroda and the twin schools of the current Leonardo da Vinci Mobility Project play an important part in putting the trainees in contact with companies abroad.The mobilities take place in the Easter, summer and autumn holidays. First the applicants have to hand in a motivational letter and a Europass CV. After intense interviews we implement an intercultural training block course individually matched to the participants in order to prepare the mobility. Before the departure there is a meeting where the learning contract and the Europass mobility are set up. While being abroad the trainees are required to send short status reports to the project managers via email. The quality management is effected by means of reflection and evaluation sheets. Additionally the realised internships are assessed by a presentation at school and a report published on our homepage. Non-satisfactory aspects of the internship are examined and improved in the next travel period.Moreover we enable our trainees to adapt their professional and social skills so as to attune them to Europe as a potential workplace. Concerning their academic performance the participants are predominantly good or very good students. We therefore expect them, above all, to act independently regarding the acquisition of the internship as well as the organization of accommodation, departure and arrival. The local companies support their trainees very well. What is more, there is a regular coordination with the project managers Ms V\u00f6lkel-Wipke and Ms van der Velde. This was the basis for the development of a network between our school, the local companies and the partner companies within the European Union. Last but not least there will be long-term synergy effects for the cooperation with our twin towns Scarborough and Ostroda and for the consolidation of the relationship with our European twin schools.", "http://www.scarborough.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-003016_1"]]}}, "2JW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Technology for the young generation", "Scarborough UTC", 33977.0, 3, 4, "The HTL Ferlach provides technical education for Weapon Technologists as well as for Managers of Production Processes and Industrial Designers. Ferlach is famous for the craft of gunsmithing, which is a member of the world's cultural heritage. The combination of craft and modern technologies is a main part of the curriculum, which has been established to offer a good education to the youth. Students from all over the world come to Ferlach to improve their technological knowledge.\r\nThe project \"Technology for the young generation\" aims at the expansion of the learning space to the European dimension. The institute in Uhersky Brod and the Technical College in Scarborough offer different approaches to technical problems. These different approaches are owed to the historical, cultural, social and political circumstances of the countries. The Czech Republic looks back to a long tradition of weapon technology, Scarborough UTC has many industrial companies as a background who act as supporters of the school in financial and material matters.\r\nWithin two exchange periods in 2018/19 twenty students of the department of weapon technology/gunsmith will be sent to Uhersky Brod and twenty students will travel to Scarborough and participate in the education at the local institutions. They will have to fulfill practical tasks, treat theoretical questions, visit companies and mostly discuss with their colleagues technical and social topics. A main idea of our co-operation is establishing a student-exchange  on both sides. Students from Uhersky Brod and Scarborough will stay for two weeks in Ferlach and continue with their working tasks they started in their home country. The students will co-operate for four weeks, in this time they should learn from each other, the local students should act as tutors for the guest, they will form a community and at least this could lead into life-long friendships.", "http://www.scarborough.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA102-039020_1"]]}}, "3TU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "EU - grenzenlos sozial", "Carewatch Care Services Limited", 29236.0, 5, 8, "With this project we want to give our students the possibility to fulfill their obligatory internships within the EU.

Austria in general and especially Carinthia live from the interdependence with the European and international economic and cultural areas. Accordingly qualified young people are urgently required here. At the same time we want to continue to internationalize our education that already conveys a strong international component. We also believe that in this way we can counter tendencies towards stronger national differentiations with positive experiences with international exchanges. Aims:The emphasis lays on the development of occupational competences of the trainees, which we define as language, commercial, intercultural and social competences. The interns are challenged to use and extend their knowledge and skills as they are deployed in enterprises of great interest and quality. Consequently their chances on the Austrian and international labour market are rising (\u201eemployability\u201c). Moreover, their qualifications are increased to take an active part in European life and to accept the challenges of a more and more multifaceted society in a positive way. The participating institutions (school, companies) should also share their experiences and benefit from them.Participants and activities:In the first year of the project probably 6 students from the third to the fifth grade will take part as \u201cpioneers\u201c in this special project. They will carry out economic activities, for example in a hotel, a welfare institution and a language school (office, marketing, event management, customer service, reception, \u2026) in the United Kingdom for six to nine weeks. In special workshops they will be prepared for their jobs regarding language acquisition, job relevant activities and organization management accompanied and assisted by the project team, teachers of diverse subjects and our language assistant-teacher. Later on the experiences will be passed on to a larger target group in different formats (peer-to-peer activities, reports, presentations,\u2026). In the second year of the project the number of internships will definitely will be raised. There is a tangible interest of students and relevant traineeships so that we expect that the internships for 2017 can be fixed in time.Implementation:The Absolventenvereinigung der Handelsakademien Klagenfurt (Association of graduates of the business college Klagenfurt) as the applicant body is responsible for the processing of the project and cooperates intensively with the business college in Klagenfurt. For this reason a separate account was opened. An optimal coordination is guaranteed through close personal interrelations. Our English assistant teacher Lewis Hamilton is intensively involved in our project and he strongly supported us in finding adequate companies and suitable accommodation facilities and he will also coach and assist our trainees on site. Further stakeholders, such as parents, will regularly be implicated.The application of instruments on the Europass and ECVET-basis will also assure the quality of the execution and the internships.Expected results and consequences:Mainly the learners will profit from the projects directly, as their professional, social, language and cultural skills will certainly be advanced. With a highly regarded internship abroad they will obviously have great advantages on the labour market that looks for motivated, open-minded and well-educated applicants.Also the participating institutions will have the opportunity to share the experiences of the trainees (respectively the involved partners) who will improve their competences in international project organizations. The teachers will benefit from this projects by expanding their experiences through post-proceeding activities and by passing them on to their other students.Moreover, the region will profit from higher qualified young people in economic and social respects.Long-term benefit:Our project is just at the beginning. We want to extend it in the course of the next years and we would like to create a sustainable culture of internationality in education. We hope that we will be able to inspire motivated young people for this opportunity and to make contributions that our region will also be able to unfold its potential in Europe in a better way.", "http://www.carewatchcareserviceslimited", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016446_6"]]}}, "3UZ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1346457600000, 1419984000000, "Detection of Oil in Compressed Air (DOCA)", "Castle Group Limited", "The project aims to solve a major problem plaguing the industry regarding the detection of oil contaminants in high purity compressed air. It aims to develop an online sensor that will detect oil contaminants in all its forms (liquid, aerosol and vapor) with an extremely high sensitivity in accordance with ISO-8573 Class 1 standards. The lack of any reliable, highly sensitive, online sensor system has forced critical industries to rely on manual sampling and laboratory analysis which is labour intensive, inefficient, and cannot guarantee the conformance of the compressed air system to mandatory or industry adopted regulatory norms.  The sensor system will benefit a large category of industries that require high purity compressed air including, hospitals, pharmaceutical, automotive, chemical, textiles, electronics, clean rooms and other related industries. The ability to detect contaminants online, will significantly enhance the capabilities of these companies to guarantee the quality of their products and eliminate a number of risks and civil liabilities that are associated with non-conformance.\n\nTo achieve the project results, a consortium of 3 competent SMEs with an interest in the area of sensor development partnered with 3 leading research partners for the development of this project proposal. The major requirement for the sensor element is extremely high sensitivity, repeatability, robustness to interference, and stable calibration. It was decided after much deliberation that optical spectroscopy is the most promising technology for the development of such a sensor. We have dedicated 3 work packages (WP4, 5, and 6) for the development of 3 key components that are vital for the development of the sensor - namely development of the sampling system, development of the optical spectroscopy unit and development of electronics and software.
