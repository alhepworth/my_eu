The City of Edinburgh Council in implementing the model has developed a framework to introduce a second language from nursery upwards in all primary schools. In order to meet the requirements of this new national policy we have identified that there is a need for staff training, both in language skills and methodology,  in order to embed the target language into our school. Three members of staff, two class teachers, one working at early/first level and the other at second level, and one specialist PE teacher working across all classes, will engage in the immersion course training to improve both their own skills and confidence in French and also to develop skills in methodology  and teaching which they can then disseminate throughout our school on their return. Undertaking an immersion course in France will have added benefit in that it will give the participant an awareness of contemporary French culture and life style and will encourage them to consider developing the European dimension in our school by engaging in partnerships with schools in France. \r\nIt is anticipated that the impact of this project will far reaching. At a personal level participants will benefit from increase fluency and confidence in their spoken French and also an increased ability to teach French to young learners. These new skills can then be shared with staff across all stages in school to increase the capacity throughout school and thus improve the learning experiences of our pupils. We envisage that by improving the skills of some members of staff we can then cascade their new skills throughout and thus upskill less confident members of staff by offering shadowing opportunities and sharing new resources. \r\nImproving our methodology in teaching French will have longer term benefits in that when we introduce language 3 - probably in 2016-17 - we will be able to use a similar methodology and also adapt ideas used in French for the 3rd language.\r\nAt Colinton Primary our vision is to provide the best possible learning experiences for our pupils, and we believe that by enabling 3 teachers to participate in this training and then sharing that learning, we will improve the learning experiences which we provide in modern languages and thus better prepare the children to reach their full potential in the future", "https://colintonprimaryschool.wordpress.com", "Colinton Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013307_coordinator"]]}}, "0PU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Language Training", "Merchiston Castle School", 3255.0, 1, 1, "2 teachers training in language and methodology to embed the target language into SchoolHelp school follow new national curriculumFind partners abroadGet pupils to use ICT to communicate with other schools in UK and abroadWe hope to increase cultural awareness and language teaching methodology in order to develop a vibrant modern languages department where pupils are encouraged to communicate in the target language,  and use ICT skills to develop meaningful relationships with other language learners in Europe.  Two teachers from the department with a particular interest in the communicative approach and ways in which ICT can support language learning will attend the course and develop their skills in this area.  They will also find partners who they can explore the possibility of eTwinning with, as well as other forms of exchange.
