According to the PISA (2012) results, the proportion of low achievers is dramatically high in CY (32,8%), RO (37,3%), IT (19,5%), PT (18,8%). Students also show a general de-motivation towards reading. Lack of interest in childhood continues in adulthood.  The proportion of non-readers is very high in Portugal (60%), Cyprus and Italy (44%), and Romania (48%) - source: EB 2013 on cultural participation.Children from disadvantaged households and with migrant backgrounds are less likely to be able to read well at school and to be motivated to reading than their classmates \u2013 and this has the potential to be devastating for their future lives.Reading is the key to unlocking every child\u2019s full potential and opens up a world of possibilities.\u201cThe Living Book \u2013 Augmenting Reading for Life\u201d aims to address these urgent needs by developing and testing an innovative approach whose main aim is to motivate 9-15 year old students to read more (at school, at home and in their communities) and enjoy more the experience of reading. Student motivation is, in fact, a key factor in successful reading.To engage the most unmotivated and underperforming students, The Living Book combines customised reading path with digital creativity. We will explore various solutions to \u201cdigitally augment\u201d the experience of students while reading a book. We wish to turn the physical book into a \u201cLiving Book\u201d: an intense-lived experience for young readers who can participate, transform and augment what they are reading, thus applying digital competences, collaborating with peers, developing reading skills and, ultimately, being more engaged in reading. This approach will be supported at school, as well as at home through the engagement of parents.The multi-stakeholders strategic partnership will:- Author \u201cThe Living Book Guidelines\u201d, e-publication providing teachers and other relevant stakeholders with methodological guidelines to implement The Living Book- Develop the OER - The Living Library Platform (www.thelivinglibrary.eu) and toolkits with the aim of offering students and teachers online \u201cready-to-use\u201d tools to augment the reading experience with rich media content. The books in the Living Library will be brought to life with contents curated and created by students and teachers from across Europe.- Develop a set of 8 practical lessons plans. The plans provide teachers with examples on how to integrate the living book approach into their classroom activities and practically define the competences of the Augmented Reader- Launch of 2 Blended training courses for Augmented teacher and Parental engagement. Both courses foresee the self-assessment of learning outcomes and the recognition of competence acquired by teachers through a certificateThe resources will be launched, pilot tested and widely disseminated across Europe.The dissemination strategy is oriented to reach the school sector, at first, as well as relevant stakeholders active in other sectors, such as public libraries, e-book and digital publishers, local organisations, \u201cGLAM\u201d actors, technologists and digital makers, citizens. Sectorial and cross-sectorial strategy will rely on 12 multiplier events organised in 6 countries and further activities, such as the circulation of 2 recognizable brands (Augmented reader and Augmented teacher), press-conferences, e-newsletters, mass-use of social networks.Structurally embedded in the logic of the project are:-          1 Joint Staff training Event held in Cyprus to deepen The Living Book approach and ICT-enhanced reading-          4 short term exchanges of groups of pupils in RO, PT, CT and EE. A unique occasion for 24 students from vulnerable groups to take part in an international experience and collaborate with EU peers in reading activities and experiences of augmentation.Main impacts on teachers will be: increased competence in cultivating young students\u2019 motivation and reading abilities; a greater responsiveness to the needs of disadvantaged groups by developing, amongst others, competences in involving parents to support pro-reading strategies. In the medium/long term, these impacts will be sustained by: the availability of multilingual OER; the creation of communities of Augmented Teachers, that favour networking, and stimulate continuing professional development in this field.Main impacts on students will be: Fostered a positive attitude towards reading and greater motivation thanks to the attractiveness of the blended approach proposed, the social dynamics created, and the support of parents. We expect this impact to be amplified in the medium-long term: dissemination activities, carried out even after the end of the project promoting the Living Library, will generate a higher number of users, thus increasing the community and fostering an even higher engagement on the side of participants that have participated in its testing and creation", "http://www.gryd.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-CY01-KA201-017315_7"], [2016, "Grandma's Story - Engaging migrant youth in their local communities", "GRYD LTD", 230345.0, 6, 9, "The project \"Grandma's Story\" - Engaging migrant youth in the local community\r\n\r\naims to produce\r\n\r\n1.

The objective is to develop a comprehensive training material for the target group youth workers working with refugees and their children, intercultural learning environments, often in their second language about their history in a setting of migration, tolerance and diversity. The secondary target group is educators working museums and galleries, heritage and community associations especially those within areas of larger ethnic minority populations.\r\n\r\nDocumenting Patterns of Migration and Integration as a resource for training in Youth work. the project will begin by recognising and recording the stories of the \u201cGrandmothers\u201d. The older generation of women whose stories are seldom collected or retold. The stories upon which the project is based are found all over Europe. Young women left their homes and migrated to another country or region. Through hard work they established themselves and to varying degrees integrated into their new homeland.  The narrative is similar even if every story is unique:\r\n\r\nI had to move because it was even impossible to survive cultivating the ground\u2026\r\nI had to move because of the war\u2026\u2026.\r\nI just deserved a better life\u2026\u2026\r\nWe were exchanged.......\r\nI came because my husband came to work.......\r\n\r\nThe aim is not specifically to look at why people left but to record the migrant women\u2019s story of migration and integration. We wish to learn from Grandma\u2019s experience. We will specifically look at stories from the West Midlands UK in the 1970's and 80's, Russian speaking women in Estoina, newly arrived refugees from the Middle East to Italy, Roma and other minorities in Sweden in the 1970,s and 80's and the exchange of population between Turkey and Greece in the 1950's. The objetive is to develop this core information into a methodology that can be repeated in any EU country.\r\n\r\nSince the end of the Second Word War, migration flows have increased in all EU Member States, either through immigration or emigration. Today migrants from third countries account for around four percent of the total EU population. Europe is confronted with an ageing population and a shrinking workforce \u2013 leading to labour and skills shortages that will challenge economic growth prospects. Increased migration is seen by many economists as a positive factor to growth. Consequently countries that make the best use of their migrant population have the best prospects to develop. The current context/crisis concerning migrants, refugees and asylum seekers fleeing conflict from the Middle East and North Africa is part of an ongoing narrative. This narrative will seemingly continue and managing migration flows will continue to be a challenge for all EU society. Youth work has a key role in forming a society in which citizens have equal rights and opportunities in health, employment, personal growth and development and unhindered access to public goods and services with a view to ensuring social cohesion, social inclusion, multicultural coexistence and economic development of the EU.", "http://www.gryd.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA205-035162_5"], [2014, "Robotics for Schools", "GRYD LTD", 194169.0, 4, 7, "The gap between teaching five year olds the basics of coding and the skills and knowledge needed for basic entry level VET is too large. In order to begin bridging the gap this project aims to establish an educational policy document, progressive series of curricular developments, course plans and teacher training courses for mathematics, science and technology teachers at Primary, Lower Secondary and Upper Secondary level within the are of Robotics in Schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gap between industry needs and an available skilled work-force is getting larger. Several studies throughout Europe point out that the engineering fields are not the first choice of young people, however the engineering skills and ICT field itself are defined as one of the key knowledge of economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe area of robotics, informatics and mechatronics is quickly moving from a specialized within engineering and science to a situation where it is fully integrated within society. The situation could be compared with the area of ICT and Internet approximately 10 to 15 years ago.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEstonia is a good example:\r\n\r\n\"Given the country\u2019s tiny domestic market, start-ups have been forced to think global, says Taavet Hinrikus, Skype\u2019s first employee and co-founder of TransferWise, a peer-to-peer money-transfer service. Over 14,000 new companies registered in Estonia in 2011 (World Bank), 40% more than in 2008. High-tech industries account for about 15% of GDP. Education is important, too: in 2012, a programme called ProgeTiiger (\u201cProgramming Tiger\u201d) was announced, to teach five-year-olds the basics of coding. \u201cIn the 80s every boy in high-school wanted to be a rock star,\u201d says Mr Hinrikus. \u201cNow everybody in high-school wants to be an entrepreneur.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMistakes made in general education throughout the EU over the last decade within ICT should not be repeated. Many studies have shown that throughout the \u201cinternet era\u201d the focus on ICT has moved from \u201chow things work\u201d almost exclusively to \u201chow to use\u201d technology. The latter \u201chow to use\u201d is now recognized as a redundant educational concept as all students simply learn and use ICT as a part of everyday life. The call from many governments is for education to move back to an understanding of how things work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCost is not the barrier that it would be if, for example, trying to introduce computers to all students, as cheaper hardware solutions become available. Some examples of this are the Raspberry Pi,Arduino platform, Makey Makey and Ushahidi that can be purchased quite cheaply and used to control many external devices, and adapted for different ages and abilities \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Robotics moves into general everyday use in society the need for a more general understanding of its component parts increases at all levels of Education: 'The internet of everything' - Essentially the idea that soon all items will be connected to the internet is on our thresholds.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn order to bridge the gap between learner, teacher and curriculum planners the projects objectives are to create:\r\n\r\n1. A policy document on requirements at local/regional school authorities, teacher training institutions etc. for Robotics in Education.  A policy document for transfer implementation and innovation will be developed to allow authorities to make the relevant changes needed in order to implement the proposed methodologies and practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Research report to identify how teaching \u201cbasic programming, how computers work and robotics\u201d has/will influence the school curriculum taught at different levels from primary to upper secondary. Initial desk research will be followed by scenarios being tested in primary to secondary schools. The outcome of this research is to propose a) training framework and b) further advances in the relevant educational theories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Research report on Good Practices into successful pedagogies teaching robotics as part of a blended learning approach for training \r\n\r\n4. Cross-sector cooperation between schools and other organisations leading to i.e. curriculum development, reinforcing basic skills, (in our case defining basic ICT skills for teacher and learners).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. An ongoing/rolling curriculum or course plan for school/institutional level from primary to upper secondary with specific exercises for teacher / pupils including: 1. A series of practical lesson plans using robotics in schools as part of blended learning activities..  2.

While our staff has great expertise in special needs, ICT has been identified as an area which is fast developing and in order to support our pupils with special needs we need to learn new skills in the area of technology to facilitate the progress and development of pupils with special needs in all subject areas and  in particular literacy and numeracy. Our staff wish to enhance their range of skills and teaching methodologies in this area and that this in turn will impact on the teaching of learning in our school . It will also support us in developing resources which may be of help to the wider European Community though the e-twinning website.By asking our staff (all qualified teachers and Classroom Assistants) to attend these courses, we are ensuring the development of high quality effective digital resources, which can be utilized by others. The description of the activities, methodologies that will be utilized in the 7 courses are outlined in detail in the links provided:-Digital Extra Programme which can be found on http://www.eucourses.eu/digital-extra/what-is-digital-extra.-Sharing Landscapes Programme which can be found on http://www.eucourses.eu/sharing-landscapes/what-is-sharing-landscapes,There will be 31 staff from St. Ita's and St. Joseph's  attending 7  courses  and one preliminary visit to the UK (to plan the the initiative) over 24 months.In the short term we hope to improve the use of ICT to support our pupils in teaching and learning. We also hope to improve standardized scores in literacy and numeracy. We will develop digital materials which will enhance the teaching and learning of our pupils in all subject areas. The skills learned will then be utilized collectively to ensure and development of digital resources which can be used in other schools  in the long term. My vision for this initiative and those that participate in it is that it will continue the necessity of adopting a life long learning attitude amongst staff in relation to ICT and the ever progressing educational arena of technology. The long term effects will be on staff learning in ICT, on pupil learning in literacy, numeracy and ICT and on the learning of the wider and global community through the publication of our results and resources on line.", "http://www.eucourses.eu", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IE01-KA101-008609_1"], [2018, "We Open Wide the School and the Minds", "Elderberry Gryd Limited (Trading as EUcourses.eu)", 34680.0, 8, 12, "THE PROJECT WOW AT THE INSTITUTION SAINTE MARIE RIBEAUVILLE\r\nThe KA1 project  WOW (We Open Wide the school and the Minds) takes place in the Institution Sainte Marie in Ribeauvill\u00e9 in Alsace, France member of la Fondation Providence de Ribeauvill\u00e9. The school is composed of a primary school, a lower secondary school and a boarding school for girls and boys. We have 320 pupils. 12 members of staff of which 8 secondary school teachers, 2 primary teachers and 2 members of the administrative staff have decided to get involved in the project.\r\nRESPECT OF EACH PERSON AND OPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD\r\nTwo priorities have been identified. First, the staff of our school (teachers, educational staff, administrative staff, the Principal) has noticed that our students  coming from very heteregoneous backgrounds don't necessarily show respect to their classmates, the staff members, the material or the premises. \r\nWe welcome in our boarding schools at any time during the year new students due to social, educational, financial or other motives   Some students also leave us during the year for the same reasons. It is our duty to welcome them in our institution as best we can, to enable them to trust us, to help them like school, the place where they can get the best preparation for their future professional life.  Respect towards each person  must be shown so that our students feel good at school. A renovated, active and personalized policy of welcoming everybody, trying to understand everyone, whether be it when they first arrive or during their stay with us is vital.  The project WOW aims at welcoming everyone in our school in the respect of his/her past taking his/her weaknesses and strenghts into account.  A positive and tolerant atmosphere will enable our students to concentrate on school. Our second priority is to open the school towards the outside world: the town, the charities in our region and the parents. We want to open the doors of our school and work with them for a better understanding of each other. Finally we think that it is vital to widen our intercultural approach so that our students can fit in tomorrow's world at best. Through E-Twinning or other exchange projects they should become aware of the necessity to understand another language and work with citizens from the European Union. Focus on foreign language is then essential.\r\nTRAINING SESSIONS FOR A PERSONALIZED APPROACH AND OPPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD\r\nA group of 12 staff members have volunteered to attend training sessions about various topics all through Europe. The courses dealing with Multiple Intelligences, preventing bullying, Hidden Talent in your classroom or Inclusive teaching were chosen to help us understand how we can better work wih our students.  Partnership with the outside world will be achieved through a training session about the way to discover the city and observation in a finnish school. Other training sessions concern languages (English, German and italian) to show that interculturality is really important to us.  Finally a training session about the European citizenship and multiculturality in the European projects is also planned. These training sessions will enable us to achieve our goals of accepting everyone in a respectful atmosphere, reducing the school dropout and widening our cultural horizon. \r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe first training sessions focus on languages (English, Spanish, German and Italian) so that the following courses are attended without linguistic apprehension. Follow the courses about inclusive education, hidden talent in the classroom, anti-bullying or multiple intelligences. The other partners in the project (parents, students, teachers) will be asked their opinion through surveys so we can adjust our project. The whole staff will be informed through meetings. (for the teachers every 6 week and for the rest of the staff twice a year). \r\nIMPACT\r\nFor our students, the impact will be seen through a renewed involvement in school, a better self-esteem and  trust towards other but also with better relational, intercultural and academic skills. The teachers will manage their classes in a different way for a better teaching and learning. For our school the impact will be a new positive and committed image in the large communities of parents, mayor, members of our Foundation and  the academic authorities of Alsace.\r\nBENEFIT\r\nThe benefits can be from a personal point of view for our students, staff members  but are also institutional. Our institution hopes to keep its students and to attract new ones thanks to this policy of respect and individualization.\r\n\r\n\r\n.", "http://www.eucourses.eu", null,

The project takes into account the need of developing an antidiscriminatory, fair and inclusive European learning system. Actions should be taken to raise awareness on discrimination issues and their legal and ethical frameworks.  Specific competences due to disabilities, as for example unusual mathematical talents in the field of autism (Savant Syndrome), should be recognized as a teaching potential. MULTI-sided contributes to enable trainers or developers of adult education programs to develop an inclusive scheme for their training courses and apply it to their institutions.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of the training offers, the learning content derives from the theory of \u201cMultiple Intelligences\u201d (MI Theory), developed by the American psychologist Howard Earl Gardner. The trainings will offer didactic and practical exercises to adult trainers and will allow the implementation of innovative approaches adapted to various types of learners and talents. The predominance of linguistic and logical / mathematical intelligence in the European learning system, sometimes leading to discrimination against other talents such as musicality, kinesthetic or interpersonal talents, should be put into question. Through MULTI-sided, adult trainers will gain more competence to recognize and foster the potentials and talents of learners. The objective is to create an integrated teaching approach, which addresses the potential of learners in a more versatile and thus inclusive way. \r\n\r\nMULTI-sided is open to both members and non-members of the EU-Fundraising Association.

Teachers\u2019 further training and field observation in a school of another European country are also of utmost importance, in order to collect experience and to make ourselves acquainted with good practices, which will be a part of the new policy of our High School. All of the eight teachers who will take part into these actions have a very good or excellent command of the English language (and several of them of the German, Italian and French language as well). One of them is very familiar with European programmes being the eTwinning Ambassador for the Ionian Islands and all of them are willing to train themselves and others and share the knowledge they will gather during these actions. The teachers will participate in two actions:\u03911. Participation in a training programme about innovative technologies and educational software Web 2.0, through which the participants will acquire skills for the distance learning courses and the use of electronic tools for the strength of educational activities. \u03912. Aims of the planning of field observations are the reinforcement of our High School strategic planning and policy in a number of fields by using good examples of the school we are going to visit. We aim to focus on a number of topics such as dealing with school violence / bullying, early school dropout, setting rules about the right use of mobile phones and devices in general, the field observation and registration of teaching methods and infrastructure used both in conventional classrooms and laboratories. Through this observation we aim to change our own way of thinking and behaviour, in order to accomplish the targets of our plan for right and extrovert policy.  One of the first expected results is the activation of the other teachers in European programmes / actions, with the motivation of the interaction with European colleagues and the accomplishment of several common actions, by bringing a European dimension to their school and making it into an educational institution which provides everyone with training opportunities and co-working with other European educational institutions. As far as students are concerned, they will gain self-confidence in the use of foreign languages and they will improve their educational level through their constant contact with pupils from all over Europe.  In addition to this, it will strengthen their European profile and even enable them to search (in future) for a work position in an European country outside Greece. To sum up, we would like to mention that the expected results include the acquaintance of knowledge on new technologies which will be incorporated in the educational process but also on distance learning programmes which will be very helpful for us not only for our lesson planning but also while dealing with innovative programmes, such as environmental programmes, eTwinning programmes etc. Through interaction with our European colleagues we are looking forward to cooperating with others and to creating a net of teachers, schools and countries for future multilateral school partnerships (KA2).  Through field observation, we are looking forward to gaining knowledge and good practices regarding dealing with school violence and regulations about using mobile phones and regulations about technology issues in general.

The educators involved into this programme have been very active and committed in promoting and discussing various elements of incorporating ICT in the learning process. Since last year a need of improving their digital presence rise. Using web platforms, web tools and web spaces to design and manage digital learning material  has been demanding. So our project aims to equip and enable the participants to evolve their skills in designing and managing digital learning material meaningfully and productively. For this, the 8 participants will visit schools abroad that already implement 1:1 and have powerful web platforms where job shadowing will reveal good practices .They will also participate in  structured courses concerning web designing and management, so as to feel confident to use the web tools provided by the school VLEs. Peer observation reports and set of questions and answers  (eg ' the most significant change method' ) are the methods with which all the necessary information is going to be gathered and, after discussion with all participating members, a summary of good practises will be available online. In the long term (since our school is the only public primary school on the island so far that implements 1:1 programme with tablets to all students in the school) all these skills gained by the participants will enable them to mentor other educators that will need to incorporate ICT in the learning process  locally and internationally.", "http://www.eucourses.eu", null, "erasmus_2016-1-CY01-KA101-017243_2"], [2015, "Improving Leadership, Teaching Methods and Learning Opportunities for our Children", "Elderberry Gryd Limited (Trading as EUcourses.eu)", 2834.0, 4, 5, "The program \"Improving Leadership, Teaching Methods and Learning Opportunities for our Children\" aims at the professional development of staff in two key areas:\r\n\r\n* Development, training and strengthening school leadership for effective implementation of reforms .\r\n* Professional staff development in alternative learning practices and new teaching methods.\r\n\r\nThe  teachers of our school will be visit selected school in country with best results in international surveys.
