To adapt teaching and learning techniques to be accessible by all regardless of prior qualifications,.\r\n2. To influence the design of Sustainable Communities across Europe - Sustainability in all its senses, environmental, social, economic and practical with specific emphasis on Sustainable Construction.\r\nBackground:\r\nAcross Europe rural areas are in decline. Young people move away from remote areas to be educated, then to find work. This decline has significant impact on local services & on the environment. Keeping communities diverse and inclusive is a challenge that must essentially be met to maintain equality of opportunity for those people continuing to live and work in rural areas. Rural buildings are often difficult to maintain as traditional skills die. Thus alters the face of our villages which threatens our cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nThis project builds a Model for Sustainable Communities. There is a bespoke training programme incorporating flexible, participative vocational training in traditional construction techniques alongside the essential ingredients of personal and professional development and empowerment. The resulting ECCE Build Certificate is recognised in both VET & HE. sectors.\r\n\r\nThe Objectives include:\r\n1. Discovering old & new techniques of Sustainable Construction. Learning together with partners to design & deliver the ECCE Build Certificate with recognition of qualifications so that vocational training is measured to be equal to that of academic study.\r\n2. Understanding how better use of natural materials brings community benefits and can influence future design of buildings.\r\n3. Creating a series of exhibition example community buildings as a legacy to the project activity and as a focus for further work.\r\n4. Establish a Network for Sustainable Communities across Europe.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nUsing the expertise of University of Jaime 1, Castellon Spain and their experience of the e-Brick House, alongside the traditional construction industry vocational training experts of Concept Training, Ashford, UK, the partners design and deliver the new training course using the ECCE Methodology developed in an earlier Erasmus+ programme. Each partner contributes specific expertise & develops the innovation further.\r\n\r\nThe new course consists of 6 Learning Modules with each partner leading on their specialist area and the focus is on sustainability in all its forms throughout the project. This includes Sustainable Communities.  The project examines constraints in the town-planning processes in each country as well as environmental issues relating to social housing and alternative construction methods. \r\nBut the project is not just about buildings and construction, the partners show that in designing Sustainable Communities the keys lie within techniques of empowerment, communication, open informal learning and pride of place.\r\n\r\nThe project trains 24 trainers who then cascade their learning to train local participants. Practical sessions are endorsed by distance-learning. One new environmentally sustainable building is created by each partner. Using different local building materials the training Modules include ancient skills and traditional construction methods alongside environmentally friendly technologies for the conservation of energy and efficient use of natural resources. Trainee participants are previously unqualified in construction and in most cases will be drawn from disadvantaged groups. \r\n\r\nThe Partners:\r\nLed by La Colporteuse, a Community Association and Popular Education Centre in rural France, the project leaves a legacy of environmentally-friendly community buildings created by joint training workshops. Ongoing local action groups continue the work.  The University of Jaime 1, Castellon, S.E.Spain works alongside Concept Training, Ashford, Kent UK to oversee the training and to work towards parallel recognition of vocational and higher qualifications. The Lammas Eco-village in Wales UK, ProVita a Social Enterprise Community in rural Romania and the Living Museum of Fundacion Uxio Novoneyra in Galicia, N.W.Spain completes the partnerships. Each building uses local expertise and traditional skills, augmented by partner experience and contributes towards the Model of Sustainable Communities.\r\n\r\nThe Results:\r\nOne new training course - ECCE Build Certificate recognised as a vocational qualification with recognised credit transfer value for European use.

High rates of youth unemployment and young school leavers show the need for implementing projects which launch reflection and experimentation actions designed to improve quality and innovation in youth workers\u2019 approaches to unemployment. At the same time the project will support the social inclusion of young people through employability - in line of objectives and fields of action of the renewed framework for European cooperation in the youth field (2010-2018)\r\nDATA\r\nDropouts: EU28 average (12.7% in 2012).

Italy (35.3%); Spain (53.2%); UK (21%) (Eurostat).\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES \r\nThe project aims to promote a strategic partnership between 4 European organisations in order to foster the inclusion and employability of young people, ( aged between 17 and 24 years), with fewer opportunities (NEETs and young people with disadvantage backgrounds). We will achieve this through a comprehensive social intervention at personal, family and social level in their path to a job.\r\nSpecific objectives:\r\n1. To share innovative good practices in youth workers\u2019 approaches to unemployment, especially for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.\r\n- Activity: Development of a database. \r\n2. To develop a comprehensive approach (methodology) to support young people with fewer opportunities in their path to a job by involving young people, youth workers, families, companies and other stakeholders.\r\n- Local working groups, methodological guide. \r\n3. To improve the skills and competences of youth workers, especially digital competences, so that they will be able to offer a high quality support to disadvantaged young people in their job seeking. \r\nActivities: Training activitiesin ICT for youth workers  and the development of ICT-based resources for cooperation and communication (portal web). \r\n4. To empower disadvantaged young people in their path to a job as well as promoting meetings and reflection spaces with stakeholders (companies, public administrations and policy-makers) and other European young people (virtual mobility).\r\n- Activities: local events and virtual mobility. \r\n5. To improve the international capacity of participating organisations by adding European value to their experiences,  guidance and job placement programmes  for young people with fewer opportunities.
