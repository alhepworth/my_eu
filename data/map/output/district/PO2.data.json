To a large part this is necessary for keeping up performance and function, often for health reasons, although sometimes this is for purely aesthetic effects. Thus, easy-to-clean, soil release and antimicrobial properties are linked aspects that are of great importance such: health and avoidance of cross-contamination in medical textiles; improvement in comfort and freshness in consumer apparel; reduction of spoilage or wastage during storage and transport; increase useful lifetime of articles. These benefits further contribute to the overall goal of sustainable product development, to save energy and to protect our water resources. As alternative to commonly used biocidal chemicals, we propose a new surface modification concept that can control surface microbial contamination, particularly the development of bacterial colonies and biofilms.  Taking into account the needs of customers and environmental protection, the NanoBond Project aims to develop a new antimicrobial \u201csoft nanotechnology\u201d that comprises:  \u2022Adaptability to a wide range of consumer and industrial applications.  \u2022A responsive technology that adapts to the particular requirement for anti-microbial effect without \u201cswamping\u201d the environment with the un-restrained release of chemical antimicrobial agents, which is typical of other antimicrobial technologies.  \u2022Highly-tailored solutions by altering the characteristics of the polymeric nano-film. The NanoBond Project will exploit the \u201csoft nanotechnology\u201d to create nano-structured and functional surfaces that can impart multiple beneficial properties, or can act as a scaffold for the further incorporation of other performance finishes.  \u2022Durability and effectiveness for the life of the goods. \u2022Easy application and low application levels.", 110552.0, 1900330.0, 7, 9, "NANOBOND", "http://www.nanobond.org", "http://www.dcsdesigns.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2013-03/54701.jpg", "fp7_93699_996536679"]]}}}}
