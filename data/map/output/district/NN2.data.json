The Partners comprise schools and school networks, NGOs, and University research centers. It aims to address the challenge of early school leaving (ESL) by focusing on an approach aimed at the prevention, through new pedagogical strategies for co - operation and strategic planning between actors of formal and informal education, between school and local community. Taking as term of reference the statistical data for 2013, stating that 12 % of young people aged 18 - 24 in the EU are Early School Leavers, the title of our project recall the objective of \"Europe 2020\": reducing such rate below the 10%. ESL is a tragic phenomenon for young people because it can lead to social and economic exclusion, low employability, low self - confidence and often deviance. ESL is a tragedy from both the social point of view since in a modern democracy, responsible and active citizenship requires high levels of education ; and it is also a problem for  economic development because it depletes the \"human capital\" necessary for the \"Knowledge Economy\". The international scientific community agrees that ESL has  a systemic nature. Starting from this concept, our project aims at developing transversal and multi - disciplinary solutions and methods so as to develop the skills which both schools and informal education actors need to work together;  and to introduce didactic methods oriented to re - motivating  all students, included those more disadvantaged; and to develop local strategic medium and long term plans to prevent and counteract ESL.  Notably our project intends to achieve the above mentioned objectives through the realisation of two Intellectual Outputs:1. a social qualitative research of drop - out aspects and causes  in the Partners' countries that can be  considered paradigmatic of the generality of European contexts;2. a model of training and participative co - project planning based on an Action / Research approach to problem-solving and which allows and enables the local actors to study ESL in their territory, to innovate learning systems and to elaborate together a local integrated plans of action. Such plans will be developed through:- an initial phase of  local workshops for joined training of \"first level stakeholders\" (teachers, professional educators, volunteers and social workers);- a second phase of practical work, i. e. implementation of what has been learnt and projected during the workshops: so pilot - experiences developed by the participants to the workshop with young people, inside and outside the schools (not only with young drop - out, but also those that can be a positive example for peers de-motivated or border - line);- a conclusive phase during which the \"second level stakeholders\" come back for further training to reflect on the lessons learnt by working with young people, and propose to \"first level stakeholders\" (principles, headmasters, local institutions representatives, CSOs manager) local and multi-annual integrated plans to prevent and reduce ESL. As for expected results, our project purposes are:to update the frame of knowledge on ESL and drop-out causes, in order to reach  more effective policies and practices;to create or enhance local networks among schools, local institutions and associations involved in the work with and for young people;to elaborate Local Integrated Plans against ESL;to spread  innovative methods both in formal and informal education;to empower and  increase school success for disadvantaged young people involved in the pilot - experiences.   The long - term expected results and impact are:- to enhance the capacity of formal and informal education systems to work together by planning objectives, methods and action tools. - to optimize the use of financial resources, towards a new \"education community welfare system\"- to contribute at the definition of more effective policies against ESL - at national and European level - in order to meet the objective of \"below 10%\" as more as possible in all the EU countries.", "http://www.northampton.ac.uk  ", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA201-024125_8"], [2015, "Equity and Social Inclusion through Positive Parenting", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHAMPTON", 314105.0, 5, 9, "Equity and Social Inclusion through Positive Parenting (ESIPP).\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\nAutism is a lifelong condition which affects about 1% of the population (or approximately 7.5m European citizens) as well as those who live with them and care for them. \r\nThe presence of autism can be extremely challenging to parents and other family members, and autism has been identified as causing greater family and parental stress than any other disability. The condition can challenge traditional parenting styles and cause parents to feel deskilled and disempowered.  The presence of autism within the family can negatively affect the educational achievement, employment opportunities and social inclusion of mothers, fathers, siblings and the individuals with autism themselves.\r\nTeaching parents to understand the condition, and to work effectively with schools and other professionals, has been shown to be effective in improving outcomes for individuals with autism and their families. However, though such parent education programmes have been developed in e.g. Western Europe and the USA, there is little or no availability of such programmes or materials in many areas within Europe, for example in the Balkan/Eastern Mediterranean region.  \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn order to address this inequity, a strategic partnership has been developed involving universities, non-governmental organisations and the parents of children  with autism to:\r\n-develop an evidence-based model for delivering parent education in autism that can be used across Europe\r\n- develop a core curriculum and ecologically valid parent education training materials\r\n- use these materials to provide parent education to families living with autism in areas where it has been previously unavailable\r\n- evaluate the effectiveness of the materials and the impact of the training using quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis\r\n- share the model curriculum, tools and materials with stakeholders and make recommendations to policy- and decision-makers.\r\n\r\nPARTNERS\r\nThere are nine partners in the strategic partnership.

It will also witness the Partners making a ground-breaking attempt to change the current paradigm of teaching entrepreneurship at HEIs. \r\n  \r\nCurrently, there are 816 master and 198 bachelor degree programmes in social sciences offered by European Universities and the demand for courses in social sciences is growing (UNESCO: World Social Science Report 2010, www.masterstudies.com). The role of social sciences, however, is progressing from social engineering to a wider set of contributions to society. Therefore, there is a need for more fundamental and \u201cjoined-up\u201d reflection upon the needs of societies coping with ICT, welfare, migration, climate change and ageing population. \r\n \r\nHEIs have an essential role in forming the next generation of social entrepreneurs, prepared and positioned to solve these problems. However, they are faced with numerous obstacles \u2013 most notably by a lack of cohesive campus-wide vision for social innovations and a lack of staff. \r\nOur studies show that students overwhelmingly prefer professions in the social sector; however, they are more interested in \u201cexperiencing\u201d rather than studying social innovation by becoming involved in its implementation (CC survey, n=36, 20.03.2015). Therefore, HEIs that wish to implement a culture of social innovation must be ready to increase the flexibility of teaching pathways, incorporate student-driven activities into their curricula and use Massive Open Online Courses. \r\n \r\nThe Project has THREE ESSENTIAL AIMS: \r\n1. Fostering the implementation of social innovation at European universities (mainly in Centr. Europe) by developing and mainstreaming useful instruments addressing the demands of HEIs: model curricula, step-by-step guidebooks, explanatory videos and sourcebooks,\r\n2. Changing the paradigm of entrepreneurship education by making it more practical and student-oriented through developing, testing and implementing flexible and project-oriented learning pathways,\r\n3. Increase the accessibility of Centr. European universities by mainstreaming the MOOCs (as an example we will use designing social innovations).\r\n \r\nThe Project is BASED ON FOLLOWING PILLARS: \r\n1. A far-reaching and socially important idea translated into a comprehensive and coherent implementation concept that includes a \u201cdesign and test\u201d formula, deep involvement of Partners and networks (\u201cThe envoys of Social Innovation\u201d) and empowerment of stakeholders to shape the project in a manner that guarantees its relevance to the current demand of the target group,\r\n2. An innovative approach, which consists in the combination of: student-led learning activities (new to the world innovation), a mentoring programme for incubation, using open learning communities in formal learning and exploiting elements of massive online teaching in Social Innovation,\r\n3. A strong partnership. The Partners specialise in various fields and thus complement each other. Together, they will constitute a complete environment for the development of academic entrepreneurship: HEIs, business incubators, entrepreneurs and social organisations.\r\n \r\nThe project will IMPACT the following groups:\r\n\r\nDIRECTLY: \r\nEUROPEAN HEIs.

The strategic project consortium will be made up of eight partners from England, Finland, the Czech Republic and Germany, and will include one institution of higher education from each participating country, in conjunction with one national partner of differing organisational structures including VET/HE institutions, NGOs and disability organisations. \r\nThe key objective of this two-year Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership project is to support an effective transition process for students with SEND from VET into employment, by collaboratively producing and evaluating three unique communicative and informative tools. There will be a SENEL website dedicated to disseminating the project and making the tools available to the widest possible global audience for long term sustainable impact. \r\nProject activities will include administration and quality assurance, implementing a dissemination and valorisation plan, writing piloting and evaluating the three outcomes described in the following paragraphs, and running three multi national and two multinational dissemination/presentation events.\r\nThe first project outcome will include a portable exhibition of documentary photographs and videos of best practices on partner countries, available with accompanying text in four languages. This is based on an analysis of shared good practice across the partners and supporting access to the workplace and continuing VET and links to the workplace.  \r\nAfter investigating current approaches, best practices and assessing needs involved in the process of transition from VET/FE, the second outcome will be a tool for employers entitled \u201cA Mini-Guide for Employers of Young People with Special Educational Needs and Disability\u201d. This will be developed, piloted and evaluated by the SENEL in collaboration with a range of stakeholders including young people with SEN and employers. The Mini-guide will provide essential information and guidelines for employers and other stakeholders to facilitate and encourage accessible employment for young people with SEND. \r\nThis will be followed by the development and evaluation of the third outcome: a tool for young people with SEND entitled \u201cThe Passport to Employment for Young People with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities\u201d. This will provide both guidance and a self-advocacy tool for VET/FE students with SEN transitioning from VET/FE to work. It can be downloaded from the website and printed, or used as an interactive online tool, as required. \r\nDuring 2011-2013 this consortium previously successfully completed a joint project: Towards Inclusive Learning Environments (TILE) targeted at developing inclusive environments in VET/FE institutions. This project will build on this success and will see the development of these tools as a continuation of the collaborative process with all partners. Project meetings to inform the development of the tools and the sharing of best practice will be held in each participating country.

Reason: lack of a non-vocational training offer suited to their needs and interests, and lack of motivation due to insufficient awareness of people aged 50+ about the benefits from lifelong learning (LLL).\r\n - low level of digital competencies- ICT, and lack of motivation to use them resulting in social and digital exclusion of people aged 50+,\r\n - missing know-how at many higher education institutions related to the use of the potential they have: educational, organizational and infrastructural to drive and conduct non-vocational lifelong learning for people aged 50+ \r\n - lack of competencies among academics to prepare and conduct non-vocational courses adapted to the needs and learning capabilities of people aged 50+.\r\nTo help counteract and address the presented problems the following actions were planned in the project which shall translate into results and outcomes.\r\n1. Creation of a survey to research interests of people aged 50+ (split by females and males) as well as their motivation to undertake personal development activities, with research held at partner universities as a follow-up.\r\n2. Survey data to be used to select 40 topics for courses and workshops for people aged 50+ as well as the development of curricula. At least 50% shall address the needs of males, since they make up just under 20% of people 50+ who are active.\r\n3. Insights shall be used to prepare an effective marketing campaign dedicated to the group aged 50+ and to create promotional materials that will be used in focus group research. \r\n4. To prevent digital exclusion of people aged 50+ a Moodle50+ platform shall be developed for remote learning and communication, suited to the capabilities and needs of people aged 50+ and five 18-hour long blended learning courses shall be prepared on ICT, adapted to the pace of learning of people aged 50+.\r\n5. In order to improve the skills of partnership universities\u2019 staff in teaching people aged 50+ they will be trained on the methodology of preparing and conducting classes for people aged 50+ using Moodle50+. For dissemination purposes they will run similar workshops for their universities\u2019 staff.  In addition, a manual shall be prepared on how to teach people aged 50+.\r\n6. The presented project outcomes will be regularly disseminated on the project website and will serve as input to develop an innovative tool dubbed AU3A Guidebook (Academic University of the Third Age Guidebook), which will be a compendium of know-how, tools and best practice for universities in EU, to commence and conduct non-vocational education of people aged 50+.  \r\n\r\nIn order to test the manual, offer and for promotional purposes Dumpupinar will start a Third Age University pilot in which 50 people aged 50+ will take part.

There is  the clue that transition from school or apprenticeship to work is not always successful and therefore the requirements for young people with disadvantages or disabilities are not availabe. The reason is not a lack of competences in the academics and other professional skills but in the soft skills as selfconfidence and social- emotional competences that are necessary to cope with the challenges of labour market. Employers report that because of this reason a sucessful integration of young people with disadvantages/disabilities into the labour market  fails. In this project the vocational institution for Heilp\u00e4dagogik  want to inform themselves how selected European partners work to prepare young people with disadvantages/disabilities to the labour market to ensure a sucessful transition into work life.

It is planned, to visit vocational training institutions to learn about the services and arrangements to strengthen  the selfconfidence and other social-emotional competences from young people with disadvantages/disablities. On the other hand we want to talk with institutions which have services and arrangements to  coach and monitor young people with disadvantages/disablities when they have difficulties to cope with the challenges in their work life. \r\nIn the center of discussions with the responsible teachers and trainers as well as the heads of institutions of vocational training institutions  there are the counselling and coaching competences, the condititions of the material and personal ressources that is necessary for sucessful integration of young people with disadvantages/disablities.
