The Veneto Region since 2006 launched ad hoc initiatives to encourage the spread of this new concept of entrepreneurship. Companies more careful to the challenges of the future have already recognised the validity of the 'triple bottom line'model\u2019 (which notes the impact of corporate behavior on the economic, social and environmental level). The school in its process of opening up to Europe and the world cannot help but  wonder about the relationship between CSR and globalization, making itself interpreter of a sustainable  internationalization.\r\nThe beneficiaries of the  biennial mobility project are: a) 120 VET students of economic, commercial and marketing area; 10 staff members.\r\nThe learners mobility will last five weeks, and wants to develop a moment of pedagogical training which increase personal capacity and skills, such as language civic and social competences, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, digital competence, cultural awareness and expression. IRES will promote the increase of organizational, managerial and operational skills/competences, starting from the assumption that SMEs are placed in an increasingly competitive global scenario. The internship will be placed within the educational curriculum, on the basis of a training agreement. The experience will use the methodologies ECVET. The selected host countries are: Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Ireland.\r\nThey have been carefully chosen not only considering the foreign languages studied in the schools, but taking into account the different economic history of each one and then the different  way of implementation of CSR. The foreign partners are established reality in the field of training, expert about design, management, implementation of European projects in relation to staff and learners training,  and to vocational training in the company of students and graduates.\r\nAs for staff mobility, emphasis was placed to seek partners already active in the ErasmusPlus  field and particularly reliable. They are able not only to strengthen the language skills but offer job shadowing experiences that allow a) the transfer of best practices in use in partner countries schools; b) the strengthening of cooperation with local and transnational bodies involved in the partnership network.\r\nThe impact on learners will be the development of professional, personal and international skills and competences as tools to facilitate integration into the labor market and the reading enterprises\u2019 needs.

Companies find less and less qualified aspiring people to whom the management of the business can be passed over faithfully. Experience shows that the smaller the company, the bigger this problem is. This means, that the most affected are micro and family businesses, which in fact account for 60% of all European companies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sector most hit by this problem is tourism, where 95% of companies employ fewer than 10 people. At the same time, the tourism industry is crucially relevant to our society, as it is the third largest economic activity and the sector continues to grow. However, there are almost no concepts available for how to support these companies in their business succession process, especially not in developing appropriate profiles for qualification and in selecting those aspirants who are best qualified for taking the business forward. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur project will contribute to developing solutions to the problem through the following three main activities: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome this situation, the project group has developed three main intellectual outputs: \r\n\r\nA) Implementation of a European survey to obtain a clear picture of the situation in Europe and to define which knowledge, skills and competence are generally valid in Europe for taking over businesses successfully.

Results and outcomes of this work will be evaluated, analysed and published in a survey and competence description report.\r\n\r\nB) Based on these outcomes the BEST BOSS assessment procedure will be developed, tailor-made to the needs and demands of the main target group. For this, the partnership will define 10 to 15 assessment areas, against which potential business successors will be evaluated. The assessment procedure contains several assessment steps and applies different methods and (partly) online-based instruments (tool box). The assessment procedure and tool box will be piloted in four partner countries before all the instruments and a guideline of usage are published in all partner languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC) Finally, we will publish the BEST BOSS policy paper, which will summarise experiences and outcomes from the project activities, and provide deductions for Europe\u2019s labour market, HRD strategies as well as its regional, economic and ecological development.

Although tourism has a broadly positive impact on economic growth and employment, it is also a resource-intensive industry that leaves a large footprint on the environment and it can also threaten cultural heritage and local food production.\r\n\r\nTherefore, sustainable tourism and CSR in the tourism industry are intensively promoted by political decision makers as well as by an increasing number of customers and guests. In this context, sustainability and CSR have become standard elements of all good quality training at the VET and HE level within the last 10 years. Also large tourism chains and global operating service provides usually apply CSR standards.\r\n\r\nHowever, one target group has had so far very little contact with the concepts, philosophy, methods and instruments of sustainability and CSR in tourism: micro and small to medium enterprises. Their managers usually have no access to information about CSR and, in any case, CSR concepts have to date not been tailor-made for micro and small enterprises. The trouble is that 95% of companies in the tourism sector employ fewer than 10 people. This brings us to the situation that the vast majority of tourism providers in Europe have not even heard of CSR let alone applied it.\r\nIn order to overcome this situation, the project group has developed three main intellectual outputs: \r\nA) Implementation of a European survey to obtain a clear picture of the extent to which CSR is known in the tourism industry, especially within micro and small sized enterprises.

PARTNERSHIPThrough this project, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA envisage to resume the partnership established in 2014 as part of the successful Mobility bid in the area of Vocational Education and Training (VET), having as target group students undergoing vocational education and training in various vocational qualification. The first activities and experiences gathered in conjunction with the implementation of the mobility bid selected for funding in 2014, project title \" TYPISCH BRITISCH\", together with the implementation of a UK successful bid, with mobility flows being sent from the UK to AKKL, have motivated the project management team of both institutions, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA, to resume the successfully started cooperation and also include another UK-based college in this project.Due to the increased interest in mobility work-based learning placements in the UK, as expressed by the German students, following AKKL\u00b4s project application funded in 2014, AKKL commenced searching for an additional potential project partner. Given the already existing work contacts with COLEG CAMBRIA, based in Wrexham/Wales/UK, AKKL had the opportunity to learn about GRWP.LLANDRILLO MENAI, also based in North Wales, in the UK. GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is the result of the merger between 3 colleges, as follows: Coleg Llandrillo (Llandrillo), Coleg Meirion on Wyfor and Coleg Menai. GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI\u00b4s educational offer, as well as COLEG CAMBRIA\u00b4s, matches well the German vocational qualifications provided by AKKL, as the experiences gathered in conjunction with the bid funded in 2015 proved. Hence, GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is a good match as the second hosting partner.2. NEEDS Based upon the increased interest and needs of AKKL\u00b4s German IVT students to participate in European vocational mobility placements, AKKL has planned a total of 8 flows spanning 2 years, from 2016 until 2018, for 120 IVT vocational students undertaking the apprenticeship scheme in Germany, with 2 UK-based hosting institutions, COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLOWithout the opportunity offered by the ERASMUS+ programme, AKKL\u00b4s apprentices, throughout their vocational training, would never have the chance to undertake work-based learning activities in another European country and thus gather both practical, work-related experiences, as well as personal, intercultural experiences. The linguistic competences of the target group are rather poor and can be improved by participating in such work-based learning mobility activities.3. OBJECTIVESFor the vocational courses provided by AKKL spanning 2016 until 2087, the internationalisation strategy of the institution shall be resumed by implementing a new mobility project, targeting the  vocational qualifications preferred by the institution, by offering work-based learning placements in the UK, financially backed up by EU funding.Hence, five two-week mobility placements have been planned, financially supported by ERASMUS+ and hosted by COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - COLEG LLANDRILLO, both based in Wales, in the UK. On the other hand, COLEG CAMBRIA, beginning with autumn 2015, is planning to send out a comparable number of 8 IVT student flows to AKKL, as included in their 2016 KA1 VET Mobility bid in the UK, shall their project application be selected for funding in this bidding round. The same is also planned by GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI for the 2016 bidding session.4. OUTCOMESThrough these mobility placements, the German apprentices shall gather hands-on, intercultural and linguistic competences by taking part in work placements with two different UK-based Vocational Colleges. This should enable the participants of this mobility project to move more easily and flexibly in the German, as well as European labour market.5.

PARTNERSHIP\r\nThrough this project, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA envisage to resume the partnership established in 2014 as part of the successful Mobility bid in the area of Vocational Education and Training (VET), having as target group students undergoing vocational education and training in various vocational qualification. \r\nThe first activities and experiences gathered in conjunction with the implementation of the mobility bid selected for funding in 2014, project title \" TYPISCH BRITISCH\", together with the implementation of a UK successful bid, with mobility flows being sent from the UK to AKKL, have motivated the project management team of both institutions, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA, to resume the successfully started cooperation and also include another UK-based college in this new project. \r\nDue to the increased interest in mobility work-based learning placements in the UK, as expressed by the German students, following AKKL\u00b4s project application funded in 2014, AKKL commenced searching for an additional potential project partner. Given the already existing work contacts with COLEG CAMBRIA, based in Wrexham/Wales/UK, AKKL had the opportunity to learn about GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI, also based in North Wales, in the UK. GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is the result of the merger between 3 colleges, as follows: Coleg Llandrillo (Llandrillo), Coleg Meirion on Wyfor and Coleg Menai. \r\nGRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI\u00b4s educational offer, as well as COLEG CAMBRIA\u00b4s, matches well the German vocational qualifications provided by AKKL, as the experiences gathered in conjunction with the bid funded in 2014 proved. Hence, GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is a good match as the second hosting partner. \r\n2. NEEDS \r\nBased upon the increased interest and needs of AKKL\u00b4s German IVT students to participate in European vocational mobility placements, AKKL has planned a total of 10 flows spanning 2 years, from 2015 until 2017, for 150 IVT vocational students undertaking the apprenticeship scheme in Germany, with 2 UK-based hosting institutions, COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - COLEG LLANDRILLO. \r\nWithout the opportunity offered by the ERASMUS+ programme, AKKL\u00b4s apprentices, throughout their vocational training, would never have the chance to undertake work-based learning activities in another European country and thus gather both practical, work-related experiences, as well as personal, intercultural experiences. \r\nThe linguistic competences of the target group are rather poor and can be improved by participating in such work-based learning mobility activities. \r\n3. OBJECTIVES \r\nFor the vocational courses provided by AKKL spanning 2015 until 2017, the internationalisation strategy of the institution shall be resumed by implementing a new mobility project, targeting the vocational qualifications preferred by the institution, by offering work-based learning placements in the UK, financially backed up by EU funding. \r\nHence, five two-week mobility placements have been planned, financially supported by ERASMUS+ and hosted by COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - COLEG LLANDRILLO, both based in Wales, in the UK. \r\nOn the other hand, COLEG CAMBRIA, beginning with autumn 2015, is planning to send out a comparable number of 10 IVT student flows to AKKL, as included in their 2015 KA1 VET Mobility bid in the UK, shall their project application be selected for funding in this bidding round. The same is also planned by GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI for the 2015 bidding session. \r\n4. OUTCOMES\r\nThrough these mobility placements, the German apprentices shall gather hands-on, intercultural and linguistic competences by taking part in work placements with two different UK-based Vocational Colleges. This should enable the participants of this mobility project to move more easily and flexibly in the German, as well as European labour market. \r\n5. COMPOSITION AND TIMESPANS OF FLOWS \r\nAn overall number of 150 vocational students/apprentices (see qualifications below) are planned to be sent out to COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - LLANDRILLO COLLEGE, grouped in 5 separate flows each.

In the field of economics, the students will be instructed to fulfill the duties of a sales assistant, bookkeeping and accounting.  In the field of tourism, the students will be instructed to fulfill the technical procedures characteristic to travel agencies: following the competition, booking tickets, putting together and selling holiday packages and developing a relationship with service providers.  \r\nThis project is designed to improve the professional development offered to students focusing on the practical side of this training.  Elaborate research points to the fact that it is needed to strengthen professional training at both high school and vocational school levels.  The proposed mobility project will specifically contribute to this endeavor.\r\nWe will develop a set of key competences and a set of specific competences for each program, but in addition to these, the students from each field will develop skills and abilities such as: entrepreneurial competencies, negotiation skills, leadership skills, assuming responsibility, creative thinking, perseverance, and managerial skills at the workplace.\r\nThe main objectives of these internships are the successful integration of the students at the workplace, the experience of transitioning from school to the workplace, and the usage of linguistic competences in order to become familiar with different cultures and customs.\r\nThe partners were carefully chosen taking into consideration their offer, their former experience and the recommendations we received.

The Welsh government has funded these posts and have developed policies and strategies across a number of sectors (including education) in order to increase the number of fluent Welsh speakers in Wales. The Basque country has faced similar problems to Wales in that they have seen a significant decrease in the number of people who can speak Basque, over recent centuries, and have successfully increased the number of fluent speakers to 32% (in 2011), compared to previous years (29.5% in 2001, 27.7% in 1996 and 24.1% in 1991). The most recent census in Wales saw a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers (down from 21% in 2001 to 19% in 2011), there is an opportunity here (in terms of added value) to share practices, methods, policies, strategies and for two countries with similar linguistic backgrounds to be able to support each other to develop within the Further Education sector.

In 2017 is a central international information point is set up, the website GO Abroad! is made operational, a digital guideline is developed, an expertgroep and workinggroup (including all sectors) are operational and several workshops and promotional activities are carried out. This has led to a growing enthusiasm for international activities in the organisation. \r\n \r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nInternationalisation fits in the overall policy of Gilde that everybody should be able to graduate as being \"internationally competent\".  Internships abroad are not the only way to realize this. It is also about integrating internationalisation in the study programs. For example via minors, language courses, guest speakers from abroad, excursions etc. (internationalisation @ home). For Gilde, it is an opportunity  to provide for students an added value on the labour market and to provide them more insight in other cultures and languages.\r\n\r\nFor the next coming year, Gilde Opleidingen has the objective to improve both the quality as the quantity of internships abroad. Both for students as for staff, at European level and at Euregional level. \r\nIn concrete terms, the following points of attention are defined:\r\n- strengthening the sectors in the proposal and collaboration;\r\n- further implementing internationalisation in the policy of Gilde;\r\n- attention for intercultural and language skills in the educational programs;\r\n- strengthening and optimizing the central information point of Gilde;\r\n- strengthening the communication and collaboration structure internally;\r\n- promoting internships abroad as an option for professionalisation for staff and teachers;\r\n- promoting working and learning across the borders with the Euregio (Germany, Belgium).  \r\n\r\nThe activities that are defined to realize the objectives are already put in place in 2017 and they will be continued in 2018.  Keywords are: SENSIBILISATION, COMMUNICATION  and SUPPORT. Collaboration will take place both at internal as external level. \r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS:\r\nIn the call 2018, the following numbers of students and staff are included:\r\nstudents short term: 96\r\nstudents ErasmusPro: 85\r\nteachers and staff: 39 \r\n\r\nThe total number of participants is increased significantly compared to the previous years. One of the reasons is a growing enthousiasm of students and staff, due to promotional activities, active collaboration and a workshop for staff. It seems that there is a growing motivation for mobility and an improved trust in the coordination, the organisation and the realisation of mobility activities. \r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT:\r\nBased on experiences of previous years, it is proven that an experience abroad is an added value for both students as for teachers and other staff. Not only in a professional way, but also in a personal way. By executing a part of the education in a context abroad, the complexity of the learning process increases considerably. This is something that we can never achieve within the safe environment of an educational institute. The students are better prepared for the labour market and are also less vulnerable on the labour market. For Gilde this is important towards the companies in the EUregio. Companies just across the border have a growing need for well trained and skilled people and Gilde can foresee in this need. \r\n\r\nThe experiences in this project will be evaluated (also via the particpant reports) and on the basis of the results of the students. This provides input for the preparation and the evaluation and for the improvement of the working processes. \r\n\r\nLONG TERM VISION:\r\nIn some of the VET programs it is almost a \"must\" to have international experiences. This is esepcially the case in the hospitality sector (tourism).\r\nHowever, as described earlier, an international experience offers more than only professional experiences. Therefore, an international experiences is relevant for everybody should be part of more VET programs at Gilde, so that everybody can leave the educational institute internationally competent. Eventually, the aim is to included internationalisation as a standard part of a large part of the VET programs at Gilde.", "http://www.leonardcheshire.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL01-KA102-038692_4"], [2017, "Aanscherping Internationalisering Gilde Opleidingen", "Eithinog Cheshire Home", 206556.0, 7, 16, "In response to a sound selfreflection on internationalisation Gilde Opleidingen set to work with a reassessment of the policy for internationalisation  and the implementation structure. The actions aimed at improvement result from the system check of February 2016 and are effective as from June 2016. The outcome of the reassessment plays a distinct role in ascertaining the new policy for internationalisation.\r\nBy now a steering group is operational to direct and monitor the implementation and embedding process to a greater extent. The Platform Internationalisation with representatives of the educational sectors, will simultaneously be an important body while tuning the policy for internationalisation and its implementation.\r\nThe revised organisational structure with respect to internationalisation is to contribute towards the realisation of the internationalisation agenda of Gilde Opleidingen. A clear roadmap with a flanking quality assurance programme are essential in the process in order to achieve our main objective.\r\nThe main objective of this project is to prepare learners and staff for a future setting in which each individual needs to be internationally competent and therefore better or more easily employable on the (international) labour market. With reference to staff mobility a prime consideration is what partners have to offer as to learning opportunities. The ensuing learning outcomes are taken back into the staff members\u2019 own organisation as a result of which internationalisation is widely safeguarded within the organisation.", "http://www.leonardcheshire.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA102-035120_15"]]}}}}
