What competencies does each person need to develop to enable them to apply practically their natural brilliance and genius in a world that has many challenges and which is rapidly changing?  What part can they share with others in the tomorrow society?  What are the standards and principles they can hold, develop and cherish?\r\n\r\nWe want to conduct this Y \u2013 Top EVS project in the context of the host country Wales and the strengths, character and qualities that exist in Wales.  We want to offer a range of volunteer work experiences in Wales where competence and skills can be developed that are relevant for each young life and which each young life finds propositional for their future.  Wales offers great strengths in theatre, the expressive arts, communication, community life and social innovation, which are part of its own natural brilliance and genius.  We want to create a circumstance where young people can find the best of themselves whilst volunteering in Wales.  We believe that this will lead to accelerated skills and competence development and we want to do this in an experimental 2 month program, the experience from which we will use to develop the program further with our partners. The setting for this Y \u2013 Top EVS project is Waunifor, a historic Teifi side house and estate, which is a community project.\r\n\r\nThis Y \u2013 Top EVS project is for young people who are passionate about creating a better future for themselves, their country and also a better future for the world.
