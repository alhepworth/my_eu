The rationale of our project is to intensify the opportunities of all young people including those with special educational needs and those who are disadvantaged through their social circumstances, by ensuring they have the transferable skills and qualities to guide them through further education and into employment as employees, employers and as entrepreneurs. Pupils with special educational needs and disabilities, need to be given the opportunity to be involved and active with their peers in a safe and secure environment. This project both assists those with Special Educational Needs to access opportunities, but also, to encourage others to welcome children with disability to their activities. Basic skills in numeracy, literacy, ICT and science are essential in preparing students for the world of work and rightfully have their place on the compulsory curriculum. However we feel enterprise, embraces skills including communication, cooperation, problem solving, responsibility, creativity and initiative, which are equally as important and are often delivered but not recognised or assessed. \r\nThrough this collaborative partnership we aim to make the delivery of enterprise activities easier and more relevant by creating resources which can help generate ideas, give genuine examples of tried and tested activities and provide an enterprise tracker tool which will help teachers and organisations, assess and record enterprise skills through different levels of ability. \r\nThe project will directly involve 112 students, 52 of which have special educations needs, difficulties and/or behaviour, emotional and social difficulties, who will take part in mobilities. In addition, the project  will also involve over 240 additional students who will be involved in activities and challenges shared over the internet in inter-school challenges. The project will also support professional development opportunities for 15 key member of staff and others incorporated into teams as information and good practice is disseminated throughout each organisation.\r\nTypical activities will involve challenges incorporating national and mixed international teams and will focus on enterprise, entrepreneurial and cultural experiences. Enterprise skills will be shared, developed and tested at all levels. Qualitative assessments will be made by all organisations leading to the final publications of resources representing mutually agreed definition of the skills which will be differentiated to represent different levels of ability. \r\nThrough the collaborative experiences and exchanges of information, methodologies and pedagogy, we aim to achieve an innovative resource of enterprise activities and assessment tools which can be shared with other educational providers locally, regionally, nationally and at international levels.    \r\nPotential longer term aspirations would be for education providers to appreciate the value that enterprise and an entrepreneurial attitude can add to an individual and a society, by preparing them for the future. We would like to see enterprise placed on the curriculum so all students can have the opportunity to take part in enterprise and show their creativity while gaining vital, transferable skills. We would also like enterprise to be supported by accreditation to recognise and reward the effort, skills and entrepreneurial qualities of the next generation of employee, employers and entrepreneurs.", "http://www.catcoteschool.co.uk", "Hartlepool Aspire Trust", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013622_coordinator"], [2017, "Einer f\u00fcr alle-alle f\u00fcr einen.

The title refers to being in a rope team: you will only succeed in the project if you support each other.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nThe German coordinating school has ten year\u2019s experience in organising outdoor camps focused on rock climbing  for special needs students. In 2016 the German teachers thought about transferring their skills to other natural environments like outdoor learning on the sea; outdoor learning in high mountains; and outdoor learning with severely handicapped autistic students. At the same time more and more students from other countries came to learn at the German school; these foreigners have been looked at as strangers and the beginnings of xenophobia were seen. Therefore, teachers decided to develop a European project focused on learning and moving in nature to show the social, communicative and motor skills that students gain through outdoor learning to other SEN schools.\r\nSEN teachers wanted to develop specifications of methods for outdoor learning activities for SEN students. These had been the initial ideas to create the project One4all-All4one.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n-students will no longer only be seen as handicapped but as capable, by gaining self confidence through succeeding in outdoor learning activities;\r\n-students will take part in society by participating  outdoor sports in public areas;\r\n-students will experience that, by working together in nature with others, they will gain new academic, social and communication skills;\r\n-students will develop motor, physical, thinking and problem solving skills by participating in outdoor sports like rock climbing, walking, orienteering, caving, sailing, canoeing and skiing; \r\n-students will become more aware of other cultures through a European learning perspective\r\n-staff will widen their skills, knowledge and experiecing outdoor learning projects in a wide range of European environments\r\n-staff will develop a list of methods for outdoor learning with SEN students using ICT and discussing and experiencing  nature sports with peers in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfile of participants\r\nProject participants are four special educational needs schools from Germany, (GE), Lithuania(LT), Slovakia (SK) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain (GB). The Slovakian school is a special needs school only for severely handicapped autistic students. All other participating students have got a large spectrum of special needs from learning disabilities, mentally retarded like e.g. Down Syndrome, additional physical handicaps, social competence and emotional needs and severely physically and mentally retarded students. Autistic students are at about 20% of the school students. Some of them are not able to speak and use augmentative and alternative communication methods(AAC).\r\n\r\nProjects objectives\r\nAll schools have a certain amount of experience and special excellence to add to the project. Every SEN school has learning areas in out-of-school environments and in sport or outdoor activities.  There is shared knowledge and interest in delivering this kind of learning which provides an opportunity for the schools to develop new skills by learning from each other, as well as comparing the pedagogical systems in the different countries. There is a common agreement on specialist discussions. \r\n\r\n\r\nActivities\r\nWe will have four transnational Learning, Teaching and Training Acitivities (LTTA) with students in each country with different focuses:\r\n\u2022 GE: rock climbing on low mountains range\r\n\u2022 GB: Forest School in north-east England\r\n\u2022 SK: skiing in the High Tatra \r\n\u2022 LT: activities on and near the Baltic Sea.\r\n\r\nDue to participating students having special needs, transnational planning meetings (TPM) have to be organized before the LTTA in each country. During the TPM special methods for the students to access the activities will be developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nTraditional special educational methods will be combined with informal methods of outdoor learning with  a focus on \u2018hands-on-learning\u2019  and using AAC communication skills.\r\n\r\n\r\nResults and impact \r\nA database of methods for outdoor learning with SEN students will be developed as a result of the project. Students and staff at each school will benefit from the project and will be able to access the database, which will be provided in electronic and paper formats.\r\n\r\nUsing dissemination strategies, like publicising the database in SEN and outdoor professional journals will ensure that there will be a long term impact in the years after the project has finished. The project website will be open for at least five years after the project has ended.\r\n\r\nThis project has an innovative character due to the combination of SEN and outdoor learning pedagogies being brought together by four European countries.", "http://www.catcoteschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035538_3"], [2015, "My work is my future", "Hartlepool Aspire Trust", 69219.0, 6, 6, "The project \"My work is my future\" aims to improve pre-vocational and vocational education of learners with mental disabilities in order to  facilitate transition from education to the world of work. Students with special educational needs are in danger of segregation and their chances to succeed at the labor market are very limited. As the study Vocational Education and Training \u2013 Policy and Practice in the field of Special Needs Education, issued by European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education in 2012 claims: \"individuals with special educational needs are, in relation to the labour market, usually categorised as marginalised or at risk of social exclusion.\" Therefore it is important, that pre-vocational and vocational education is of a high standard and tailored to learners\u2019 individual needs, with particular attention being paid to the integration of specific groups including people with disabilities. \r\nIn a team of 5 European countries and Turkey, examples of best practices, methods, approaches and study programs with specific  focus on pre-vocational and vocational skills will be shared in order to provide higher quality of education, enhance the competencies of students with special educational needs and facilitate their transition to work. \r\nThe participating schools provide education for nearly 900 students and employ over 300 professionals who will directly benefit from the project results, with a perspective to address other professionals, students and their families via project website. \r\nThe partnership of the project will create, with support of digital technologies, a bank of resources and tools - open educational resource (OER) website to support education of pre-vocational and vocational skills of children, students and adults with mental disabilities, based on the fact that preparation for future employment starts from early age by supporting self-care skills, through building a positive attitude toward work during following years of education at primary and secondary school, continuing through vocational training and finishing at successful work placement.\r\n\r\nProjekt \"Moja pr\u00e1ca je moja bud\u00facnos\u0165\" je zameran\u00fd na zlep\u0161enie pred-profesijnej a profesijnej pr\u00edpravy u\u010diacich sa s ment\u00e1lnym postihnut\u00edm s cie\u013eom u\u013eah\u010di\u0165 prechod zo \u0161kolsk\u00e9ho vzdel\u00e1vania do sveta pr\u00e1ce. \u017diaci a \u0161tudenti so \u0161peci\u00e1lnymi potrebami \u010delia hrozbe segreg\u00e1cie a ich \u0161ance uspie\u0165 na trhu pr\u00e1ce s\u00fa obmedzen\u00e9.
