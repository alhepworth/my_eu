The initiative responds to a call from the European Union (EU White Paper, 2007) for the improvement and innovation in the way food literacy and nutrition is taught and learned in European schools. In this sense, L4H seeks to bridge the gap between teaching/learning in the classroom and the food/health environment of school age children, through project-based curricular activities that use the daily food and eating practices of those students as curricular context. This is a three years strategic partnership of six (6) countries: Denmark, Slovenia, Lithuania, Spain, England and the Netherlands. The initiative uses existing and emerging collaborations between different groups in each of these countries to collect, synthesize, test and deploy \"best practices\" of health and nutrition. The project aims to promote healthy and sustainable eating among schoolchildren through the development of a model for changing the practices and pedagogies around food and health that can be used in most European countries.At a general level, L4H is based on 1) a focus on the \"open school\u201d approach, linking students and teachers to aspects of production and consumption of food, and 2) the development of basic and interdisciplinary skills such as digital, entrepreneurial competence, and language development, using the context of the food, health and nutrition as a teaching/learning substrate. Each country brings forth to the collective a theme or particular area of specialization offering new and innovative approaches to changing health and food culture of school age children. In this sense, L4H uses the everyday food practices of students not only as a resource for curriculum integration, but also as a tool of social inclusion. The project is guided by scientific evidence for the generation of knowledge so its interventions are implemented and evaluated with validated methods. At a\u00a0specific level, L4H focuses on professional development and mobility of school teachers and university researchers: teachers, with the assistance of researchers, will develop project-based curricular activities on both, the health and eating practices of their own students, and the local food system. To accomplish that, teachers will work closely with other teachers in partner countries to strengthen educational and linguistic capabilities thereof. These teachers will participate in systematic virtual and mobility sessions and sporadic physical mobility events within the collective to share, compare and contrast their own development with others. Such professional development will use the food and health practices of students as part of project-based curricular activities that address current problems in their communities and/or local resources. The process and product of this work will be used by university researchers to design a model for a wider implementation of procedures and technologies that support changes in the food culture and health of school aged European children.L4H integrates Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) on student learning (e.g., students and teachers share with peer their activities; comparing the dietary practices of schools in different countries, etc.) and the development of teachers, thus strengthening the role these technologies play in mediating teaching and learning in primary and secondary schools. L4H work will be conducted in three (3) phases. During the first phase, the entire collective, through a series of meetings, will generate a list of 12 hands-on activities on food and health based on their own experiences and best practices. This list will be subjected to consultation between countries to add, modify and /or shorten it. Researchers will begin working closely with schools and teachers during this phase to integrate the resulting activities in the academic calendar of the next school year. During this second phase, project members will empirically examine the impact of the selected instruments on eating patterns, critical knowledge of health, academic performance and viability of the proposed activities in the various contexts in order to further reduce the list to 5-6 instruments, which will then be tested in a wide range of cultural and national contexts. These activities include workshops in the participating countries organized by the national teams of researchers and teachers in the second and third phases of the project. In the final phase, dissemination will increase in intensity and short duration training courses will be offered to researchers and teachers in existing university-based programs, which will affect and impact of higher education beyond the partners involved in the project.", "http://haworth.schooljotter2.com/", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA203-022361_11"]]}}}}
