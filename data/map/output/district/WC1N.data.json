European citizens need improved access to state-of-the-art medical care especially in oncology and cardiology, while keeping expenditures on healthcare affordable. New therapeutic options such as externally triggered local drug release at the diseased area hold promise to solve urgent medical needs: improved treatment with reduced side effects, fewer burdens to the patient and faster recovery after intervention. Nanomedicine, the application of nanomaterials and nanotechnology to healthcare, will enable breakthroughs in clinical practice.   SONODRUGS addresses clinical needs by developing novel drug delivery technologies for localised treatment of cardiovascular disease and cancer. SONODRUGS develops drug delivery concepts where drug release can be triggered by focused ultrasound induced pressure or temperature stimuli within the diseased tissue. New drug loaded nanocarriers will be designed for tailored drug delivery systems that respond to either of the two stimuli. Medical imaging, i.e. magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound imaging, will be used to guide, follow and quantify the drug delivery process. Therapy efficacy using different drug delivery systems will be assessed in vitro and subsequently in preclinical studies. Starting form research on a broad range of materials and drugs, two nanocarriers will be finally selected, optimized and produced on a pilot scale in combination with image-guided delivery tools and methods.

CONTAMED aims to explore the hypothesis that combined exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals in fetal life may lead to adverse delayed impacts on human reproductive health. To achieve this goal, CONTAMED will combine epidemiological approaches with laboratory science. The work plan for CONTAMED is organised in three major strands focusing on human studies, animal models and in vitro assays including metabolomics. The project will deliver new epidemiological insights into associations between cumulative exposure and reproductive health, improved toxicological risk assessment for the anticipation of reproductive effects of chemicals, validated biomarkers for cumulative exposures and new mechanistic information about the ways in which chemicals may disrupt sexual differentiation during development. CONTAMED will provide the knowledge necessary to set the scene for Europe-wide human health impact studies of cumulative exposures to endocrine active chemicals and their possible role in the deterioration of reproductive health in Europe.

The recommended treatment consists in regular blood transfusions combined with chelating therapy to remove harmful iron accumulation in the body. The use of deferoxamine, the first chelating agent only available for subcutaneous administration  is limited due to toxicity and the lack of compliance, despite its satisfactory therapeutic effects. An oral iron chelating agent, deferiprone, was authorised in Europe in August 1999 and recommended for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassaemia major when deferoxamine is contraindicated or inadequate. Despite a wide experience of the administration of deferiprone for thalassaemic patients, limited data are available on its use in children below 10 years and the need for additional data in this age subset was clearly indicated  in the 2009 priority list approved by the Paediatric Committee at the European Medicines Agency (PDCO). In addition, according to the recent scientific advancements and in consideration of the anticipated benefit of this chelator in controlling cardiac iron overload, studies  evaluating the effects of the deferiprone in all the paediatric ages and in all transfusion-dependent chronic congenital anaemia (including Sickle Cell Diseases)  were also considered a critical therapeutic need.\nThe DEEP project, in line with these premises, has been funded with the specific aim to produce a new oral liquid formulation of deferiprone suitable for the paediatric use and to provide evidences for the use of this chelator as first line therapy in the whole paediatric population  (from 1 month to 18 years) affected by transfusion-dependent chronic anaemia.\nThe condition under study  in the DEEP project is rare.

It will include: integration activities, simulation activities, presentations of the participants about the use of street art in the cities and countries, workshops on making graffiti organized by graffiti artists, workshops on social activism, forum theater, creating message, cultural nights, city quest, etc. \r\nAs the result of the youth exchange the participant will create the graffiti art work on the walls of our youth house at \u00dajpest and perform a street play in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s at the end of the project.", "http://identiconarts.com", null, "erasmus_2014-2-HU02-KA105-000377_1"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "KENDRA FOUNDATION", 560857.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_13991"], [2017, "ALPHA CONSULTANTS (UK) LTD", 160276.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_13952"]]}}, "3BG": {"nhs": {"data": [["RRV", "National Hospital For Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square", "nhs_RRVNQ"]]}}, "3HR": {"nhs": {"data": [["RRV", "The Royal London Hospital For Integrated Medicine", "nhs_RRV60"]]}}, "3JH": {"cordis": {"data": [[1451606400000, 1609372800000, "Boost Brittle Bones Before Birth", "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service Trust", "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is, in its severe forms, a devastating inherited disorder characterised by brittle bones.
