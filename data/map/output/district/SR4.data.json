In each region it brings together 2 secondary and 4 primary schools to work with the local authority and an additional expert partner. Half of the pilot schools in each region have been involved in previous transnational education activity, while half are inexperienced.The 16 project partners are collaborating to achieve the following objectives:\u2022 8 sustainable bilateral partnerships which include regular communication between staff and learners using a variety of media (including virtual methods, letters, phone calls and visits) and which strengthen the longstanding partnership between the two regions.\u2022 Transnational project management experience and capacity within all 16 organisations\u2022 Sharing of best practice on delivering education on Health, Sport, Nutrition and Wellbeing, as well as Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) and Information Communications Technology (ICT)\u2022 Sharing of resources among schools, local authorities and expert partners, particularly on topics surrounding health education, global citizenship, ICT and MFL.\u2022 Healthier participating organisations which are delivering more concrete activities related to the project topic and improved academic attainment of young people.\u2022 Provision of meaningful contexts for work on MFL (exchange work with counterparts in target language) and ICT (eTwinning, video-conferencing, blog, social media) which should motivate learning in these disciplines.\u2022 Widened perspectives of staff and learners through transnational work.\u2022 Understanding of own and others\u2019 identities, shared history and present, and place in Europe and the wider world.\u2022 Empowering of learners to lead activities and take responsibility for project delivery.\u2022 Increased confidence of staff and learners in a range of areas, particularly MFL, leadership, communication, teamwork, and international working.\u2022 Production of resources for use by schools more widely including digital content and a project DVD. This toolkit should support practitioners in all Sunderland/Saint-Nazaire schools to deliver transnational school projects (particularly with focus on MFL, Global Citizenship, Social inclusion and School achievement through healthy living styles).\u2022 Delivery of dissemination events to share project results and transnational project management experience and to support other organisations to consider future applications for transnational projects.\u2022 Promotion and publicity for European transnational project work.All partners bring significant experience to the project in different areas, and will be responsible for delivering content, as outlined in project partnership agreements.

The Valletta Local Council and Riverside Consulting CIC in the United Kingdom will be working together to create a project for their youths revolving around the topic of sports, culture and climate. It is the norm that certain countries excel in certain sports on account of the fact that the climate conditions are on their side. This project will therefore aim to shine light on the different cultures of the two partner countries.

Our vocational college educates students in the fields of electronics, IT, structural and civil engineering, timber construction and integrated building technologies. The Erasmus exchange allows students to complete an internship with an international company, in a foreign country. This takes place, as part of their vocational education, at some point between July 2018 and June 2019. The name of the project is \u201cHTL Rankweil 2018 Internship Abroad and Internationalisation\u201d. \r\n\r\nOur school is known outside of Austria and is situated in Vorarlberg, which lies in the heart of a prosperous and highly technical area of the Rhein valley (\u201cRheintal\u201d), where there are many international companies. Our graduates are sought after as skilled workers by these firms and as such, it is important that our students receive a high standard of education which not only provides a contemporary approach, but also considers elements which will be important in the years to come. Through our school\u2019s cooperation with with international companies, our students can complete a professional internship, as well as gaining professional experience in a foreign country. The project allows students to gain new knowledge and skills in their field, as well as giving them an important insight into the professional world. \r\n\r\nSix students from the Electronics and IT pathway have the opportunity to undertake their internship in the UK with international companies like Zumtobel Group, Liebherr and Neutrik AG. These internships last 4-6 weeks. From the construction pathway, four students can gather professional experiences with the construction company S+B Group in Prague or Warsaw. The aim of the project is to allow students to learn new, discipline-specific skills from a company in a foreign country and further develop what they have already learnt at school. In addition to this, it is a chance to improve their foreign language skills, as they are required to use English in the workplace. Furthermore, they receive international experience and develop valuable connections for later in their careers. The project strengthens cooperation with foreign companies and is an important stimulus for the school\u2019s international outlook. The school\u2019s network is further developed by the project because the students also get to know other firms and institutes whilst in their host countries. Through their residency, the students also get new socio-cultural awareness of another country and experience more of the European Union. This exchange also imparts social competences onto the students through working in a team and promotes independence, far away from home. The students develop greatly in terms of character. The experience of an internship abroad can then be put to use back in school, with the students applying their new skills to their lessons.", "http://www.liebherr.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA102-039111_3"], [2014, "HTL.Rankweil.JobsAbroad.14", "Liebherr Sunderland Works Ltd.", 12543.0, 3, 6, "During their time at HTL Rankweil, our students receive their education and training both in theory and practice.
