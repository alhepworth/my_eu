Business and society need young people with adequatge qualifications. With the project \u201cExperience European Business\u201c we also want to further internationalise the education at our school. Beyond that, we believe that positive experiences from international exchange may counter tendencies towards sharper national differentiation.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe emphasis is on the development of professional competences of the trainees, which we define as language, commercial, intercultural and social competences. Interns shall be placed in interesting companies. In this way they are challenged to use and extend their knowledge and skills. Thus, their chances on the Austrian and international labour market are rising (\u201eemployability\u201c). Moreover, they shall be increasingly able to take an active part in European life and to accept the challenges of a more and more diverse society and of digitalisation in a positive way. The participating institutions (school, companies) should also share their experiences and benefit from them.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nIn the first year of the project we assume that 16 to 20 students from the third to the fifth grade will take part in this specific project. They will be active for 4 to 8 weeks, to the biggest part in UK, and also in Italy. We hope to arrange internships in other countries, too. Hosting organisations will be various businesses (accountancy, trade, services, municipality, etc.), which will offer varied professional experiences. In the second year of the project we expect about the same number of participants. We want to encourage learners from our evening school to also participate; so far we have not succeeded.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nLearners will be prepared in special workshops for their jobs regarding language acquisition, job relevant activities and organization management. The project team and teachers of diverse subjects will participate here. Practical and logistical preparations are done on an individual basis with each participant, also in cooperation with partners in the host country (e.g. Go English). After the internships the experiences will be passed on to a various target groups in different formats (peer-to-peer activities, reports, presentations,\u2026).\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nThe Absolventenvereinigung der Handelsakademien Klagenfurt (Association of graduates of the business college Klagenfurt) as the applicant body is responsible for the processing of the project and cooperates intensively with the business college (HAK) in Klagenfurt.

For UK internships our partner Go English is intensively involved in finding adequate companies and suitable accommodation, and in supporting our trainees on site. Further stakeholders, such as parents, will regularly be implicated.\r\nThe application of instruments on the Europass and ECVET-basis will also assure the quality of the execution and the internships.\r\n\r\nExpected results and impact:\r\nMainly the learners will profit from the projects directly, as their professional, social, language and cultural skills will certainly be advanced. With a highly regarded internship abroad they will obviously have great advantages on the labour market that looks for motivated, open-minded and well-educated applicants.\r\nAlso the sending institutions will have the opportunity to share the experiences of the trainees. They (respectively the involved persons) will improve their competences in international project organisation. The teachers will benefit from this projects by expanding their experiences through post-proceeding activities and by passing them on to their other students.\r\nMoreover, the region will profit from higher qualified young people in economic and social respects.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefit:\r\n2018 will be the third year of our mobility project.

We believe that by introducing professional mobility through the Erasmus+ programme (that is to say by creating the opportunity to study health and youth studies in a foreign country) it  will make the subject and vocational training more attractive and increase the quality of our vocational program and ensure that students complete their training. In addition, we strongly believe that this kind of programme will result in a greater demand and uptake from students interested in vocational training. \r\n\r\nThe students will develop richer knowledge and skills and an entirely different perspective on health and youth studies. The programme will allow students to see both similarities and differences in their vocational training programs and to reflect on new practical approaches within their respective vocations.\r\n\r\nOutplacement incorporates many elements of a young person\u2019s socialization process and allows them to build a core set of social skills such as empathy, respect and tolerance. These are key social skills that are included as part of the school\u2019s existing outplacement training. Outplacement is also about cooperation, group processes and conflict management.

Moreover, e-learning so far has not received much attention within quality assessment procedures. The understanding of concrete learning behaviour and uses of electronic courseware and online resources is an important prerequisite to assess the quality of autonomous, lifelong learning. \r\nAnother challenge are the high dropout rates associated with e-learning, not in the least where MOOCs are concerned. Among numerous other variables, an important factor is the lack of engagement and motivation, since students don\u2019t know how they are progressing and what their peers\u2019 achievements over time are. Students involved in e-learning often have a limited knowledge of their own learning habits and which rate of studying with the online material is required. To succeed in (semi-)autonomous learning, however, a higher level of self-regulation is needed.\r\n\r\nThis project proposal addresses the Erasmus + challenge of raising the quality of education through the use of learning analytics. Learning analytics is a new and promising research field which can be defined as \u201cthe measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners in their context, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environment in which it occurs\u201d (Siemens et.

The recent evolution of web-based learning and the possibility of tracking students\u2019 online behaviour offers promising new ways of measuring actual self-study activities. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to establish a clear image of how higher education students in different European countries learn online. The goal is to map existing learning patterns in 4 different types of online language learning and teaching and maths courses and to feed back this new knowledge to the most important educational actors themselves, being the students and their lecturers. We want to use a bottom-up learning analytics approach taking the perspective of the learning process, focusing on the courses used and the students\u2019 learning trails through these courses, and intend to use process mining techniques for the analysis of the data. Therefore, a complimentary and cross-disciplinary consortium of teams from three universities and a private open source company was set up.\r\nTogether, they will first implement tracking of learning data based on the new Experience API standard for interoperability with other learning environments (e.g. mobile apps, games) and reporting tools. After a piloting phase, the learning behavior of several student groups enrolled in distance learning or university programmes with an important self-study component will be tracked during one semester. The data will be collected in a central repository (Learning Record store). An important point of concern in the project will be the privacy of the students who will be monitored. Participants will be asked to give their consent to collect and use their data for the aims that will be clearly described. The data will be kept anonymous and the EU data protection directive will be taken into account.\r\nIn a fourth phase we aim to analyse the processes of autonomous learning comparing them to the intended pedagogic objectives of the tools. Patterns of learning behaviour will be detected, based on which different user profiles can be identified and feedback about used learning resources can be obtained.\r\nFinally, data visualisation tools will be developed and implemented in order to create a learning dashboard application for students and for teachers. Special care will be given to ease of use of the dashboards for non-specialist users. These applications will allow both the teachers and the students to understand how they learn online but also to compare their profile to user patterns of their peers. Educators get dynamic and real-time overviews of how their students are progressing, which students might be at risk of dropping out or of failing for the course and which parts of the courses cause difficulties/require more feedback.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at the development of a generic model for implementing learning analytics in interactive e-learning tools, which can be reused in different educational settings, countries, courses.

The students undergo an initial training/schooting with advanced professional knowledge in the following branches: Social & Health System, Nutrition & Home, Medien & Communication (Design Technical Assistant-GTA), the technical school of social work - social education.\r\nActivities: The students will complete a four-week intenship with project partners. Health/social/education branch:e.g. childrengarden, special scholls or facilities for disabled people in Finland/Sweden/Denmark. Facilities in Northern Europe especially  practise innovative approaches in the areas of early intervestion, education and inclusion.

The GTAs get to know the future-oriented and innovative practises and new techniques through the project partners. They get introduced to the independent project management. The project partners define the project work in advance.\r\nProject implementation: The project group of the vocational colleges is responsible for organising the stays abroad. Appropriate project partners in European countries are build up, contractual frameworks (fixed contact, learning agreement/project agreement, support, language course, valuation) are defined. The information seesions for students/parents is followed by the application. The students are selected through an application process. Then preparation seminars follow. During their stay abroad they are accompanied by the project group/person of trust and their local contact (supervision, own facebook group). Following the stay abroad the students prepare completion reports and an assessment/evaluation is done.

By teaming up with leading European researchers in the field of genome wide association studies this project will perform validation of all methods on extremely well characterized set of samples resulting from the FP6 EuroSpan project.

Between 1-2% of total healthcare expenditure can be associated with this condition, of which 50% is due to hospitalisation. Digital health is widely recognised as one of the most promising solutions to this societal challenge: in the field of cardio vascular diseases, current eHealth tools are primarily focused on rehabilitation and monitoring after hospitalisation. Today, there is a transition taking place from dedicated hospital care to the home setting, with a combination of eHealth applications and miniaturised diagnostic and therapeutic devices. This is where the NWE-Chance project comes into play.\nTHE PROJECT'S APPROACH\nNWE-Chance is all about bringing stakeholders together to co-create the knowledge needed to get innovation in home care to happen in North-west Europe. The project will contribute to develop SMEs\u2019 capabilities and to increase their involvement in cooperative projects in the NWE Interreg region. During the project, two SMEs and one larger company will collaborate with three hospitals and two universities to develop and test a prototype of a platform for home hospitalisation in which supportive (miniaturised) diagnostic and therapeutic devices are integrated. The prototype will integrate a real-time monitoring system with a nano-based test for measuring potassium and creatine, and a wearable patch to monitor vital functions.\nPilots will run in three different hospitals to test:\n\nthe technical feasibility of the developed technologies;\nthe organisational feasibility of home hospitalisation for heart failure patients.\n\nThen, an Innovation-Hub will be launched to:\n\nsupport the collaboration and knowledge exchange between SMEs and hospitals in the process of developing and implementing new digital health technologies;\nensure continuity and growth of the collaboration between industry and hospitals, leading to the development of eHealth products to support hospitalisation at home.\n\nAdditionally, the project will deliver an Implementation Roadmap to multiply the innovations in other regions and initiate similar projects.", 1514764800000, 1640908800000, 366095.0, "nweurope_35_8"]]}}, "4SD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1427846400000, 1443571200000, "Real time analysis of tablet and capsule dosage during pharmaceutical manufacturing", "Cobalt Light Systems Limited", "The objective of the overall innovation project is to develop a novel instrument to measure and control pharmaceutical drug potency during manufacture at sub-second analysis speeds.
