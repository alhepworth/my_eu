This in turn will allow our teachers to help train primary colleagues in our cluster schools and across our authority to develop courses and teach Spanish in primary schools, thus fully embedding Spanish as L3.\r\nTeachers from the Modern Languages department in Renfrew High School are already training primary teachers from across the authority in implementing L2 and L3 (French and Spanish) into the primary classroom; however more of our teachers are required to meet the GTCS standard for full registration in Spanish in order for this to progress. This entails gaining the requisite 80 credits in Spanish which both participants have already done via the CCEd course at the University of Strathclyde as well as completing the required period of residency in Spain. Janet and Pascal's participation in the LFEE 3 week immersion course will fulfill the residency requirement and allow them both to be fully GTCS registered in Spanish. It will also help to improve their fluency, increase their cultural awareness and provide them with new and innovative teaching methodologies. It is therefore crucial to plans to introduce Spanish to pupils across the school and cluster. \r\n\r\nOur vision, is to make French and Spanish accessible to all pupils in our school and indeed our cluster primary schools. The LFEE immersion course will allow our Modern Languages department to work together on creating and developing courses to introduce Spanish as part of the Broad General Education phase for pupils from first to third year and will enable Janet and Pascal to teach SQA certificated courses. With the enhancement of Spanish provision within the school, the profile of the languages department will be raised and pupils' cultural awareness increased. The participants and their Modern Languages colleagues will liaise with their primary counterparts, developing the course which sees Spanish introduced from Primary 5 onwards.\r\n\r\nMoreover, once Spanish is more comprehensively embedded  in Renfrew High School and our cluster primaries, we would look to replicate our existing French eTwinning link with a Spanish-speaking school. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, Pascal and Janet's attendance on the course will offer pupils in Renfrew High School the opportunity for increased personalisation and choice in terms of their own language learning. It will allow pupils to use their transferable language skills and to develop a deeper and more profound understanding of both English and Modern Foreign Languages.", null, "Renfrew High School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035578_coordinator"]]}}, "0DA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "LFEE Language Training", "Newmains Primary School", 1888.0, 1, 1, "The LFEE follow-up French immersion course has been selected by Newmains Primary School as a means of meeting the expectations of the national curriculum and policy. The 1-week course is based in the South of France and brings together objectives of language learning, language teaching and French culture in order to improve the achievement of primary learners in the French language. The course structure includes full-time French immersion classes led by French primary teachers each day as well as focussed cultural activities in the evenings. In sending one teaching staff member from Newmains Primary we aim to raise the confidence and competence of all of our staff in delivering  the modern languages curricular area. In doing so, we aim to ultimately  increase the overall pupil satisfaction and achievement in the French language at Newmains Primary School. \r\n\r\nThe Scottish Goverment 1+2 approach to modern language strongly promotes the teaching of foreign languages from a young age. Newmains Primary School will use resources and teaching methodologies developed on the LFEE course to meet this expectation by raising our standards of language teaching from Primary 1-7. The Curriculum for Excellence also promotes  at its core aspects such as diversity, skills for life, global citizenship and internationalism. We will use the French cultural knowledge developed by the LFEE course to help create European dimension at Newmains Primary School, thus meeting the skills promoted by Curriculum for Excellence. \r\n\r\nFollowing the course, we expect that the overall ability of staff to teach the French languages will increase at Newmains Primary. We therefore expect to see this permeating down to our pupils; improving their achievements in the French language. We later hope to share our achievements with pupils, staff, parents and our cluster primary schools through a variety of means such as organising assemblies as well as displaying results on our blog.

However, this cell transplantation approach has given inconsistent results, with some patients doing extremely well and coming off anti-PD medication for years, whilst others have shown no or only modest clinical improvements, and in some cases also developed severe, off-state graft-induced dyskinesias (GIDs). The reasons behind this heterogeneity of outcomes, and the emergence of GIDs in particular, need to be better understood, not least in the perspective of the rapid advances that are now being made in the development of stem-cell based therapies. There is therefore an urgent need to revisit the trials that have already been done with fetal VM tissue in PD patients, with the expectation that a critical reassessment can form the basis for an optimised and more standardised procedure that will translate into more consistently efficacious transplants with minimal side-effects. Over the last two years a group of international experts, including the key investigators of the previous European and North American trials, has been re-examining the outcome of these trials as well as reviewing the results obtained from recent and ongoing animal experimental studies, and identified a number of weaknesses that may explain the inconsistent outcome in previous trials. As a result of these discussions, the group has agreed to join forces in a new round of experimental work and cell therapy trials in PD, based on a new jointly developed protocol where all these factors are taken into account. In the first instance fetal VM tissue containing mesencephalic DA neuroblasts will be used, with the expectation that this will pave the way for bigger trials using dopaminergic neurons derived from stem cells.", 141835.0, 13189031.0, 5, 15, "TRANSEURO", "http://www.transeuro.org.uk/", null, "/docs/results/images/2012-10/52712.jpg", "fp7_94248_991280055"]]}}, "9RG": {"cordis": {"data": [[1204329600000, 1314748800000, "Photonic sensing of hydrocarbons based on innovative mid infrared lasers", "Gas Measurement Instruments Limited", "The SensHy proposal focuses on novel photonic gas sensors for the detection of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons can be detected most sensitively in the 3.0 to 3.6 \u00b5m wavelength range. Two particular challenging applications with significant market potential are investigated within the project. Unfortunately there are no application grade semiconductor lasers in this wavelength range yet: On the short-wavelength side of this range interband lasers are available (RT cw operation for emission up to about 3.0 \u00b5m), while intraband quantum cascade lasers were demonstrated on the long-wavelength side (RT cw operation for emission above about 3.8 \u00b5m). An additional complication for applications in gas detection is given by the maximum available tuning range for suitable mono mode laser diodes, which is currently limited to a few nanometers. Concepts for an increased tuning range have so far been predominantly investigated at wavelengths around 1.55 \u00b5m for telecom applications. The aim of the SensHy proposal is to overcome these limitations and to achieve the following goals:<br/>- realize GaSb based laser material enabling RT cw operation in the wavelength range from 3.0 to 3.6 \u00b5m- develop multi-section DFB/DBR Lasers with increased electrical tuning capability- demonstrate highly sensitive hydrocarbon detection making use of widely tuneable lasers and novel digital-signal-processing schemes to identify various gas constituents within a multi-component hydrocarbon gas mixture<br/>In order to reach these goals significant challenges have to be overcome in various fields ranging from epitaxial semiconductor growth via laser design and processing to mid infrared sensor development of the project.
