In an increasingly mobile Europe, these qualifications and the elements within them need to be portable. The ultimate aim is to have the qualification established in schools across Europe so that an exchange student can attend a school abroad and study, for example, a Physics module, there and return home with the credits for that module intact to add to their portfolio. This will give real mobility opportunities and a sense of educational community across borders.\r\n\r\nThose students whose learning styles do not sit well with formal learning and summative exam assessments are at greater risk of becoming disillusioned, disengaged, stressed and even disruptive. Similarly, those who manage well within a formal learning environment in their teenage years are also not best served in an exam driven environment, in that it places undue stress upon finite fact regurgitation rather than creative understanding and engagement with principles as continually developing concepts.\r\n\r\nWe want to facilitate creative thinking and maximise potential in all students through a holistic approach to curriculum development and implementation combining the highly-focused, analytic thinking and memory training involved in formal education with the softer focus, non-verbal, experience of interconnections and context that is often found in non-formal and informal learning. We recognise that in order to enable the successful embedding of this approach in schools, a parallel activity developing suitable CPD and assessor training will be needed. It is in this context that development of Level 2 and 3 qualifications can be realised. \r\n\r\nThe methodology for this three year project will be collaborative and involve:\r\n4 Project Management meetings to plan and disseminate results relating to:\r\n\r\n4 Curriculum Development Transnational Activities facilitated by the Crossfields Institute. These will develop an innovative integration of formal, non-formal and informal learning within school provision to reduce the number of early school leavers, and raise the attainment of all including low and high achievers, by enhancing creative thinking skills. Layers of creative thinking will be studied across the entire curriculum. Qualification meetings will write up the diploma priorities with subject specialists and in a cross curricular context, also in consultation with learning support specialists. The participants will all be experienced teachers, teacher trainers and educationalists. \r\n\r\n3 Assessor Trainer Transnational Activities lead by Crossfields will train experts to cascade down the necessary assessment training to teachers in the schools.

In 2011 it was a new, exciting, large scale, and truly innovative proposal that proved ground breaking in what it offered. It was the first project of its kind and required an open mindedness and flexibility from all partners and the national funding agency.\r\nAASE is an advanced level 3 national apprenticeship programme funded by the national apprenticeship service, established by the sector skills council for sport and owned by national governing bodies (NGB's) SGS manage the quality and delivery of the apprenticeship for the NGB's and currently work with 6 sports, and 600 AASE learners based all around England.\r\nAASE is the only apprenticeship that has been given a government exemption of the 30 hours a week work based placement requirement. This was given in recognition of the time elite athletes need to dedicate to sport training. The exemption is necessary for sporting success, however it does mean young people with exceptional sporting talent hoping to represent their country do not have the opportunity to experience a realistic work environment and learn the life skills required to succeed in the work place. This is essential for any young person to enhance future employment opportunities and career longevity. Traditionally talented young sports people have ignored their education to focus on their sporting goal. AASE has been designed to prepare athletes for sporting success but also for employment outside of their sport. \r\nThe main objectives of the mobility project are to give 150 AASE participants a year the opportunity to learn from European experts in their field, gain valuable life skills, train in a different environment at altitude and on different terrain, experience a different culture, learn a new language, build European relationships, share good practice with European peers, and collect valuable evidence towards units of the AASE qualification that will accelerate learning and improve success rates. The ultimate aim is to prepare the apprentices for the world of work. \r\nThe participants are from a variety of ethnic, cultural, social and economic backgrounds. Many will not have travelled outside of the UK or experienced flying, however their elite level of sporting success may require them to move away from home to Europe and further afield for extended periods of time at the end of their course!\r\nThe main work based activity for AASE participants is coaching local Spanish children in schools, camps and club environments. Participants are required to plan, manage, deliver and evaluate engaging, inclusive, fun and informative coaching sessions for all ages and abilities ensuring aims and objectives of each session are met. This helps local participation in sport, introduces new sports to the limited Spanish curriculum and allows sharing of high level expertise and techniques with those local children who are already participating but wish to further their skills.  \r\nCoaching young children of different ages, gender, backgrounds, cultures, learning needs, interests and communication levels hits a tremendous amount of the learning outcomes for AASE coaching and communication units. Learning is accelerated in this environment beyond anything that could be offered in the UK or within a simulated environment. It is life changing for our AASE participants in the experience, confidence and joy it gives them. Accompanying AASE staff observe and assess participant\u2019s performance against the specific AASE qualification criteria so no learning or assessment opportunities are missed. This is included in the Learning agreement.\r\nA meticulously detailed timetable includes; An AASE specific education programme delivered by the FU, Spanish lessons, local cultural activities, sport training, altitude training and some free time. It has to be structured to ensure high level sport training with coaches and AASE study continue throughout. The timetable is planned in consultation with participants, coaches, parents, NGB's, placement providers, the FU and SGS to ensure all activities are directly relevant to achieving the project objectives and the AASE units. Each project is continually evaluated.\r\nThe main impact is to enhance participant\u2019s education and giving them a European placement which will empower them to actively participate in society, teach important life and social skills to open their eyes to a life outside of sport and the UK, strengthen their employability and help facilitate their transition to the labour market.", "http://www.sgscol.ac.uk", "South Gloucestershire and Stroud College", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA102-012222_coordinator"], [2017, "Elite sport Apprenticeships  (preparing for the work)", "South Gloucestershire and Stroud College", 179929.0, 2, 2, "Back ground - The Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (AASE) as is a unique Level 3 qualification that prepares athletes who have a realistic potential of achieving excellence by either becoming a professional athlete or for a role in sport and health. It is  The Sporting National Governing Bodies (NGB's)  \"own\" AASE and select appropriate athletes from their England talent pathway  and select the delivery coaches to assess the programme. NGB's  chose an educational institution to manage AASE for them. This is the only apprenticeship in the UK where apprentices are given an exemption from the 30 hours a week in the work place (such as a plumbing apprentice) to concentrate on excellence in their sport. This is essential to become an elite athlete. As an education institution that enrolls over 300 AASE apprentices a year and runs AASE  for 7 different sports  nationally, SGS also recognises the importance for any young person to experience the world of work to learn the skills required to enhance employability and career opportunities and feels that AASE apprentices are disadvantaged by not having this experience. An overseas work placement  is specifically relevant to these apprentices as any successful athlete will be required to travel, live, train and work abroad. This experience will prepare them for this life change and make the transition easier, more effective, enjoyable and successful. \r\nObjectives  - In addition to employability skills, apprentices will also benefit from improving other essential skills such as communication, linguistic acquisition, improving cultural awareness, values and respect for others and enhancing social and soft skills, increasing motivation and keeping young people engaged in the sport industry and a healthy lifestyle, enhancing retention, achievement and ultimate success on AASE, accelerating the depth of learning and knowledge on AASE and preventing withdrawals from education running the risk of being unqualified and potentially unemployable. All are detailed in section E.\r\nParticipants - We aim to send  80 apprentices to Tenerife, over 18 months, in 6 flows lasting from 2 weeks to 4 weeks.  It is difficult to be exact with numbers, timings and flows at application stage. We have planned around the known essentials such academic holidays, major sporting events and specific sporting seasons however there could be minor circumstantial changes. Golf apprentices attend for 4 weeks  at the request of the golf clubs that we have worked with on mobility projects for the last 7 years. They like apprentices to work in each club and each department on a rotation to get a realistic experience of the industry and different management styles. The rest of the sports go for 2 weeks and coach local children in schools or summer camps, this is sufficient time to gain a depth of knowledge and understanding.\r\nActivities and Methodology - The whole mobility project has been meticulously designed  with daily activities to capture evidence required to competently complete units of AASE. This is evidenced through practical observations, written statements, witness testimonies, Q&A, video analysis and by completing daily AASE workbooks that are marked every evening. Assessment is carried out by  22 accompanying staff who are qualified and experienced AASE deliverers/coaches/assessors and attend work placement and all other activities with the apprentices to ensure there are no missed assessment opportunities. This allows  \"on the job\" experience and training where evidence can be captured immediately by assessors.\r\nAn examples of an assessment:  Apprentices prepare, manage, deliver and evaluate coaching sessions for young local children in schools often introducing them to new sports not readily available on the island such as boxing, fencing and female rugby or improving their skills in popular sports such as basketball. The children are delighted to be coached by some of the UK's most elite young athletes and learning something new. We now have awaiting list of new schools requesting us to work with them. In the golf clubs accompanying golf PGA assessors attend daily to assess the golfers \"on the job\" such as observing them managing the pro shop or golf lessons. This is not always possible in the UK as much of the evidence is \"off the job\" and simulated through classroom or practical sessions. Athletes also attend salsa and flamenco lessons where they are expected to communicate with locals in Spanish and complete a run up Mount Teide with a local altitude specialist which they must analyse the technical, tactical, physical and mental effects.\r\nResults and impact are easily evaluated through AASE unit completion during the project but also through apprentice evaluation interviews on completion and a video that each flow are expected to produce as a team to play to other College and NGB staff on return to the UK and is used to promote mobility projects to future AASE students.\r\n.", "http://www.sgscol.ac.uk", "South Gloucestershire and Stroud College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036361_coordinator"], [2015, "Travel & Tourism for SGS Learners", "South Gloucestershire and Stroud College", 48637.0, 2, 6, "South Gloucestershire & Stroud College's (SGS) main objective for this mobility is to offer experiential learning opportunities to young people who are studying and would like to pursue a career within the vocational area of travel & tourism.

Increasing customer expectations are driving the need for improved customer service skills and a capable, confident and experienced workforce must be developed to respond to this demand. The learners will work in tourist businesses undertaking activities which will correspond to the mandatory units of their NVQ, so that they can continue to gain course credits whilst on placement.Participants will be based in a tourist businesses, in a range of customer facing roles. They will be involved in activities such as working on reception, arranging excursions and marketing tourist activities in established businesses including a tour company, 5* hotel and a museum. Through structured overseas work placements in a range of established tourist businesses, participants will gain a vital insight into international work in the sector. They will have the opportunity to develop their practical skills, increase their vocational knowledge and acquire industry specific competencies. They will be supported to develop soft skills, such as communication, team work, cultural awareness and customer service ethic. In addition to their professional and personal development, the project will offer language training to increase participants' competency in Spanish. We will work with host organisations to identify suitable Learning Outcomes that are realistic and attainable for the participants and relevant to both the host partner and the NVQ that participants are studying. \r\n\r\nWe plan to target participants who have not previously had opportunities to work or study abroad.

Through a systematic partnership development process we will work collaboratively to ensure that the placement provides a structured and supportive setting, and that we able to confidently offer the mobility opportunity to those who are less self assured and lacking experience of overseas travel. This is a unique opportunity for these individuals to gain a broader perspective of work in the sector and a strengthened sense of international identity and an understanding of their position in the EU labour market. We hope that this will ultimately raise the aspirations and ambitions of our the participants, equipping them with a keen understanding of the realities of work in the sector and the confidence and competence to pursue employment opportunities in the sector in the future.

It is sufficient time for the participants to adjust to work and life in a foreign country, meaningfully gain from the experience and achieve a set of individual learning objectives in a structured and supportive environment. It also fits in to the existing timeframes of their NVQ. We will ensure that the placement is framed by a supportive pre, during and post placement structure, with group training and individual support offered in order to fully prepare participants for the placement, and to offer them a full debrief and careers guidance on how to maximise their learning on their return. \r\n\r\nWe hope that the mobility will lead to improved motivation and workplace readiness for participants.

As a team of committed internationalists we are excited about dissemination and bringing more individuals and schools on board through sharing our experience and identifying best practice.\u2022 Our objectives and horizontal priorities will have been addressed and the evaluations and reflective opportunities built in will make sure and then demonstrate that they are achievedo the project develops pathways away from conflict towards cooperation in a number of contexts starting with the personal and working through interpersonal, regional national to international;o students learn about the causes of conflict/disharmony covering 6 topic areas (religion, natural resources, mass migration, social inequality, prejudice against minorities and political boundaries) and within both a historical and modern context o students develop skills of negotiation/tolerance and personal well-being/balance through series of practical learning experienceso employability will be enhanced through knowledge, skills, leadership and confidence to engage with others having co-habited/worked in collaboration\u2022 CO2CO promotes the pan European project as having brought peace and stability to the region after centuries of conflict, and as an institution with mechanisms for overcoming ever-evolving problems\u2022 Staff/leadership teams learn to give the lead to students, guide from behind the scenes; develop cross-curricular links as well as between institutions; share best practice with each other and wider teaching community\u2022 The sustainable relationship between partners and ongoing longterm impact on schools and classroom practice are invaluable and great emphasis is placed on the meeting of head teachers and directors during the project so that they can pledge their commitment to ongoing relationships between the schools; what\u2019s more significant is that the schools' curricula will have developed along new lines to include these vital topics and classroom tools will have been developed for future use across the departments and within the pastoral system. The launch of the partnership schools as KA1 host schools will further disseminate good practice, develop new links and further the mutual learning experience between participants.", "http://www.stroudhigh.gloucs.sch.uk", "Stroud High School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024323_coordinator"]]}}, "4SA": {"nhs": {"data": [["RTQ", "Berkeley House", "nhs_RTQ54"]]}}, "4SX": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Sustaining Teachers and Learners With the Arts: Relational Health in European Schools", "Novalis Trust", 164985.0, 5, 10, "The project name STALWARTS stands for \u2018Sustaining Teachers And Learners With the Arts\u2019.  The subtitle of the project is \u2018Relational Health in European Schools\u2019.  The STALWARTS project will operate in 5 European countries: Estonia, Italy, Norway, Portugal, and the UK.  It is a cross- sectoral project that involves a University and a school working in partnership together in each country. The group of schools comprises one residential special school, two 'second chance' schools and two mainstream schools that \u2018prioritise inclusive practice\u2019. The diversity of classrooms, educational settings and European regions represented will enrich the experiences of and learning from this inter-professional development project. \r\n\r\nThe STALWARTS project aims to promote relational health in schools.  It builds upon the achievements of the current complementary LINK project (Learning in a New Key) through facilitating collaboration and learning between teachers and music and other creative arts therapists to support vulnerable young people in their transitions into learning. The STALWARTS methodology is based on UNCRC principles that encourage teachers and therapists to investigate the impact of sensory and relational aspects of music and arts experiences on the executive functions of the brain and to explore creative activities that support the development of positive attachments to which vulnerable young people have a right.   \r\n\r\nThrough the STALWARTS training programme teachers engage themselves in collaborative music making with the young people while conducting classroom enquiries that draw on observable physiological phenomena.  It is through the development of such evidence bases that the promotion of young people\u2019s relational health in the school context becomes recognised as a concern that teachers can address. In this emerging field of interest, practice-based evidence from the STALWARTS project will support shared reflections between teachers and therapists in a way that helps both groups to find synergies between their different professional ways of working.  Through discussions like these the LINK project teachers have been developing new knowledge, understandings, skills and ways of being that support them to become music/arts-based therapeutic teaching practitioners.  During the STALWARTS project these methodologies and classroom enquiries will be incorporated into new accredited university study programmes.  \r\n\r\nThus the first STALWARTS objective will be to transform these professional learning experiences into learning outcomes for new Masters level modules in therapeutic teaching practice so as to accredit teachers\u2019 enhanced competences in this field.  A common Post Graduate Certificate in \u2018Relational Health in European Schools through Music and the Arts\u2019 will be accredited in each of the 5 participating Universities and will recruit teachers and other professionals working in the 5 partner schools during the second year of the programme.   The new accredited training programme will be supported by 2 significant resources that will be developed as part of the STALWARTS project.  The first, a set of guidelines called \u2018A Framework for Impact Studies\u2019 includes guidance on how to conduct small scale classroom enquiries in this new field.  It also reports on a significant number of new classroom enquiries emerging from the STALWARTS project relevant to the theme of relational health in European schools.  The second document \u2018Relational Health in Schools in Context\u2019 provides a European-wide policy context for these initiatives.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that the main beneficiaries will be vulnerable young people within the classes of the teachers who will engage in the university-based study programmes.  Some will have had adverse childhood experiences that will have resulted in developmental trauma that is not restored or repaired through the prevalent behaviourist approaches of many schools. It is intended that the teachers of such vulnerable children who comprise up to 15% of general school populations in Europe, will have accredited professional recognition for the enhanced competences that underpin their therapeutic teaching practices and be respected for their capacities to incorporate dimensions of relational health into their new educational rationales. It is anticipated that these measures will enhance the learning experience of this vulnerable group of young people and be recognised as contributing to the wider European project 'reducing early leaving from education and training'.", "http://www.novalis-trust.org.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF ENGLAND, BRISTOL", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA203-036723_3"], [2015, "Learning in a New Key.   Engaging Vulnerable Young People in School Education.", "Novalis Trust", 146576.0, 4, 9, "This strategic partnership takes cogniscance of the power of therapeutic music and arts centred experiences to alter emotional states and engender the positive engagement of self with the world. Through the planned activities and experiences of the project, we will apply this  observation to support teachers in extending their professional capacities as classroom-based\r\ntherapeutic practitioners who can create safe, enriched, aesthetic and transformative learning environments for vulnerable young people who risk becoming early school leavers because of their poor emotional and mental health. Young people in this category continue to face  exclusion from social and educational opportunities due to personal conditions that result from their trauma\r\nhistories, including abuse and neglect within the family, experience of warfare and human trafficking.   High levels of such psychological distress exist within school populations in each of the partner countries in this application.   We have called the project 'Learning in a New Key' to emphasise our realisation that this group of vulnerable young people need to experience newly attuned ways of learning in classrooms and educational institutions.  \r\n\r\nThe multi-professional partnership comprises 4 schools and 5 supporting institutions from 4 different European regions with a spread of proven expertise in teaching, social care, therapeutic intervention, music therapy training, educational intervention, education management and educational research. The partnership has developed a participatory 2 year project strategy to create relevant and usable products that can engage and sustain teachers as active agents of change in educational settings on behalf of vulnerable young people that they are supporting. The products comprise 4 inter-related entities: a school-based teacher training programme, a first step toolkit of therapeutic practice for use in the classroom, a competence framework and narrative impact studies. These products will resonate with the realities of the classrooms where participating teachers are exploring how to frame learning within a relational process that draws deeply on cultural and psychological resources.  \r\n\r\nA main project activity is to use resources that have been developed to pilot and implement a school-based training programme for teachers in class-based therapeutic teaching practice. This will run concurrently in the 4 participating schools. The teachers will have opportunity to trial materials that provide therapeutic music-centred and arts-based experiences as preludes to lessons and as interludes to support transitions. The teachers will be supported in introducing these innovative routines through reflective supervisions with practising therapists, including music therapists.  \r\n\r\nThe activities in this multi-local project are given coherence through the even sharing of responsibilities between the partners for shaping the professional products. The various management, implementation, writing, research and review teams all include members from each region represented. The communications are supported through a dedicated website and significant resources that are created are translated into the languages spoken in the regions and schools represented.  Opportunities for mutual learning between the project participants are enhanced through an annual short joint staff training event. Opportunities for the wider dissemination of the products and findings are considerable because of the wide local, national and international networks that the partner organisations contribute to. These networks represent the interests of both the teaching and therapy professions and a longer term aim is exploit this diversity through bringing them into closer proximity to develop accredited professional development programmes in the participating HEIs based on the experience of this project.  Thus the aim of the project is to promote awareness of the wider remit of the teaching profession with respect to preventing the early school leaving of the vulnerable young people identified. The findings from the work with the competence framework will inform discussions about how  competence statements for experienced teachers in the EU region may be widened to include recognition of their classroom-based therapeutic teaching practices that can make the 'big difference' for  a vulnerable young person\u2019s learning trajectory. Findings from the impact studies, including an innovative application of flow experience within evaluations of young people\u2019s wellbeing, will substantiate the rationales for introducing therapeutic classroom practices for this vulnerable group of young people. The new training programme itself will provide a substantial base to support the further development of relevant and replicable school-based training.  All these strategies are significant to actions arising from the UN Sustainable Development Goal of promoting mental health worldwide.", "http://www.novalis-trust.org.uk", "Novalis Trust", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013752_coordinator"]]}}}}
