One of our aims is to improve the linguistic, social and cultural competence of our students and to facilitate access to essential tools of knowledge and communication in an interconnected, multi-lingual and multi-cultural world.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind our centre is trying to start up two projects that give an academic character to our European orientation:\r\n\r\n1. Implementation of International Baccalaureate (IB)\r\n\r\n2. Incorporation of the centre in a bilingual teaching method in the framework developed by the Community of Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe present project is directed at teachers and coordinators of both programmes with the aim of improving their personal and professional qualifications by participating in courses and observing activity in a formative centre that offers these teachings in the UK with an elevated level of recognized educative quality. Thanks to the mobility included in this project, our centre will improve organizational capacity and linguistic competence, will renovate its methodologies and teaching strategies and will consolidate ties with professional and European educative institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nThe participants are teachers or members of  teams of didactic coordination. In all cases they have \u201cLicenciatura\u201d qualifications in various areas of knowledge. Their ages differ between 30 and 60 years old and teaching experience between 5 and 30 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 We propose 10 mobilities for teachers  (2 - English, 4 - Other subjects in the IB, 4 - Programme Coordinators) focused towards doing Job Shadowing in Barton Court  Grammar School, Canterbury, UK. The teachers need to update their teaching methods, to observe the organization and the school functioning in a centre specialized in languages and that offers the IB. The mobility will be organized in two streams and the stays will last 5 days:\r\n\r\n - 1st stream: September- October 2014\r\n\r\n - 2nd stream: September \u2013 October 2015\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 9 mobilities for structured courses related with the teaching and learning of the English language and its culture. 4 -English teachers  and 5 - other subjects.

The crisis constitutes an urgent call to the member countries of the European Union to work together and develop efficient strategies for coping with the challenges that arise. European countries need to collaborate on solutions to integrate refugees and migrants into their societies. In this context, labour market integration plays an essential role as it supports all crucial interests by addressing social and economic goals as well as psychological ones. The key role of career counsellors and the lack of dedicated courses in academic trainingCareer counsellors play a key role in helping refugees and migrants find their best way into the labour market. Self-efficacy and economic productivity can only increase when the demand and supply of talents, competences and skills really match. This is an extremely challenging task for educational and vocational guidance, especially in cases of non-formal or non-European certified skills and when counselling other language speakers. In addition to that, the efficacy of the counselling setting is also affected by clients\u2019 experience of trauma. The contextual setting results in a process of counselling wherein specific topics and needs result in particular challenges both for clients and their counsellors. In several European countries the qualification of career guidance and counselling professionals is the subject of dedicated academic curricula. In these academic curricula there are however no parts that are preparing future counsellors for the specific needs of refugees and migrants. Also, though in some countries in-service trainings for career counsellors from Public Employment Services are being offered, there is still a lack of research-based courses that meet career counsellors\u2019 needs. CMinaR: Higher Education course and in-service training for counselling refugees and migrants The CMinaR project aims to develop and pilot research-based Higher Education courses that qualify future career counsellors for innovative career counselling and guidance for refugees and migrants. Additionally in-service trainings for career counselling practitioners working in Public Employment Agencies, will equip them with the knowledge, strategies and material to help them in their day-to-day practice for the counselling of migrants and refugees. The Higher Education course and the in-service-training for career counsellors will consist of six elaborated course units. The development of the course builds on a comprehensive analysis of the needs of the project\u2019s target groups: lecturers, students, career counsellors as well as refugees and migrants. For the needs analysis the partners will combine elements of a qualitative questioning and online focus groups. Moreover, the development builds on the outcomes of a comprehensive analysis of literature, media and resources in the project\u2019s first phase. The courses will make use of a blended learning concept that brings together elements of face-to-face courses and training with ICT-based elements, such as a media centre, alongside an interactive learning environment to be used in the implementation of the courses. The media centre will provide a variety of resources and material such as videos, activities or exercises. These materials and resources will support the learning process and aim to be of practical use for the work of career counsellors with the project\u2019s indirect target group of refugees and migrants.All resources and materials for lecturers, students and career counsellors will be made available through national as well as target-group oriented sections of the project\u2019s media centre.

In sport, more and more participation opportunities arise for people with a disability, and unprecedented media interest is generated, particularly by Special Olympics & Paralympic Games. However, the reality in many EU countries is that the majority of young people with an intellectual disability (ID) still find it hard to access sport (European Commission White Paper on Sport, 2010). They have fewer opportunities for full and equal participation, and limited opportunity to specialize/excel in the activity of their choice. Being active is a public health priority focus by the EU, but having an ID is related to lower general activity rates, and a vulnerability factor for poor health.

In addition, the project will be organized with national support and reference consortia. Description of activities; Mainly, there will be five different activities in the project: (1) Collecting information on NEETs and the refugee situation along with examples of best practices for assessing and documenting young refugees' skills and competences. (2) Develop methods and procedures to identify young migrants\u2019 skills and competences (RPL) and to provide appropriate guidance and counselling. (3) System specification to optimise the use of Skillsbank for guidance and coaching of young refugees. (4) System development and implementation of Skillsbank with interface modifications and adaptations to secure input, process, storage and output with the main objectives of RefuNEET. (5) Develop formal education and training programmes targeting personnel involved in refugee and multicultural migrant counselling along with experimental implementation of ECTS recognition of informal and non-formal learning.  Methodology A variety of methods will be used to accomplish the project; desktop research, qualitative surveys, data collection from national statistics and Eurostat, phone interviews with representatives from identified best practices, qualitative and comparative analysis, system development, experimentation and partner consultation, curriculum and assessment development, documentation and reporting.

It is based on a common history, a shared sense of culture and centuries of varied forms of political integration between nations. However, especially in the UK, there is much misunderstanding both of the processes and procedures of the EU and of the history that has brought us to this point. Having established the module Europe: From Continent to Community in 2008, Dr Lieberman has seen europhobe students with no understanding of the EU arrive at Canterbury Christ Church University (CCCU), and well informed adults emerge from its undergraduate politics and international relations programs. At this juncture in the political landscape in the UK, with the current government threatening a referendum on continued EU membership, it seems ever more important to ensure that today's youth-tomorrow's voters, citizens and politicians-are well informed Europeans. Based on this success Dr Lieberman has decided to launch a new degree program at CCCU; European Politics. At level 4, Europe: From Continent to Community will be the foundation upon which the new degree rests, where students learn about the integration process, the factors that led to the formation of the Union and the reasons we are better together, united in diversity, than apart and separated by difference. 1.

This ideal human being has the right to think, believe, and express itself freely about all matters without fearing retribution, and to be treated as an autonomous and dignified individual. But such a conception is not shared by all \u2013 and never was. Its long history has been formed through a continuous battle between two theological and philosophical traditions going back to Origen from Alexandria and Augustine of Hippo respectively. Origen saw humans as free, valuable and dignified beings, while Augustine saw them as predestined, sinful and bound to servitude. The network will investigate the reception and use of Origen\u2019s ideas in order to provide a comprehensive and historically based understanding of these fundamental values, their origins, development and the fights they have gone through. Only then can we argue for their continued place in modern society.\nSuch a project is highly relevant today, since the modern conception of humans is a fundamental pillar of Western democracies which is under pressure from both political and fundamentalist religious groups that question the societal structures building on ideas of humans\u2019 freedom and dignity, and by global crises and structures that limit the individual\u2019s autonomy.", null, 3131464.0, 7, 15, "HHFDWC", null, null, null, "h2020_198325_933918329"]]}}, "2NU": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Mobility Needs Youngsters", "Concorde International Summer Schools Ltd", 110138.0, 6, 6, "The project is aimed at young people of compulsory education segment inserted into paths of professional qualification that already provide to them both theoretical and practical lessons that corporate internships .

In these economic hard times,  foreign companies find it more and more difficult to give students an allowance for their internship. This is the reason not every student can go abroad. To enable an internship abroad for all students, this application is done. \r\nThis application consists of a total of 6 partial projects, in which the focus lies on the work experience the students achieve in this internship and for teachers to gain more English language proficiency. This is mainly for the teaching methods. \r\n\r\nThe projects offer the 92 students (VET, Commerce, Trade, Hospitality, Marketing & Events, Tourism and recreation) an orientation on the international labourmarket and intensive training oriented language learning. The student acquires a better vision of his future labour, knows where his occupation stands on the international labour market and enhances his English/Spanish language skills.\r\nThe practical work experience offers  the possibility of gaining an impression at various compagnies. The students become prepared for their definitive entrance in the business comminity, because they run fewer risks of shortly drowning in the multitude of new information and impressions. The fear of 'the jump at the deep end' that the students inevitably need to make will be removed. \r\nThe practical work experience, in a foreign county, will give the training a completely new dimension. Student will learn the role of an employee. They need to conquer their own place during their work experience. \r\n\r\nThe students experience the culture of the European country and way of working in a European organization. Students go through a personal development, because they live in an unknown situation for some weeks, without their familiar social network. \r\nAssignments students have to do during their internship are part of a formal ending of their training and are in line with the qualification files of the education.\r\nOften there is a direct reference to work processes and competences. The assignments are signed off by the internship supervisor and judged by the teacher at school. \r\nStudents who have followed a traineeship provide information to students one year lower, in order to have these students better prepared for their internship the following year.

Practical training of the learners and trainees, as well as the professional development and growth of the staff are the priorities set by IVVEC.  We have set the task to be trainee-focused and we wish to study the best practices. The HR policy at IVVEC supports learning both in Estonia and abroad. Our staff members analyze their work at the end of a school-year and plan their learning activities according to their needs. Traditionally individual meetings are held by the school administration with each of the staff, where they discuss the plans and needs for retraining and advancement. A training program is made up at IVVEC every school-year. The participation of the staff in EU mobilities is vastly supported by the school administration. IVVEC has long-term international experience in organizing mobilities for both staff and learners.  \r\nThe objective of the project is to implement a two-year project of high-quality mobilities which will enable the learners and staff of IVVEC to be more competitive. Both in Estonia and abroad the Centre will be positioned as one offering the best learning conditions to students and supporting the professional growth of its staff. Besides, the international cooperation grows more active.      \r\nThe learners, participating in the project, are the best second- and third-year students in 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years in the following vocations: multimedia, junior software developers, IT system specialist, chef, pastry-chef, tourism management, carpenter, welder, machine-tool worker, electrician, auto technician, mechatronic, automatic, finishing works in construction, hair-dresser, logistics. 110 trainees are placed for practice at enterprises, 38 trainees \u2013 at VET schools and 38 VET workers will go learning / job-shadowing at the partner schools and companies. The partners for this application are in the following states: Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Sweden, the UK, Hungary, Germany, Portugal, France, Austria, Spain and Slovenia. IVVEC has cooperated with most of the partners for many years.   \r\nThe preparation of the project has been carried out by a project team who has worked very closely and intensively with the partner organizations. The project application has been prepared in cooperation with the partners and the mobilities have been planned in accordance with their best learning conditions.\r\nThorough planning definitely serves a solid ground for successful project implementation. If funding granted, the project management team will be made up to implement the project in cooperation with the partners. The selection of the best candidates is carried out in accordance with the special procedure adopted at IVVEC. The staff members have already expressed their wish to study abroad. All the activities are documented which also guarantees the project implementation in case of unexpected changes in the project management team.\r\nThe opportunity to undertake independently a training placement abroad for students who come to study at IVVEC after both basic and secondary schools, enables them to grow more competitive both in Estonian and European job markets and gain more foreign language skills. The opportunity to have a practice placement abroad motivates the first- and second-year students to study harder. The knowledge and skills of the participating staff grows as well as their competence in advancing the apprenticeship system at IVVEC, which definitely have positive effect on the learners' motivation to study and reducing the drop-out rate.  Being abroad the participants have a great opportunity to get acquainted with foreign culture which brings to higher tolerance and respect towards it.   \r\nAll the mobility participants are issued a Europass Mobility and all the learning outcomes and assessments in different learning environments are taken into account and properly registered at IVVEC.\r\nThe successful international projects and their implementation make vocational education more popular in the region, creates a solid ground to raise the quality of education and attract more basic school graduates to study at IVVEC.

We are aware that this is a very large application, but at the same time, we believe that the application is extremely realistic. Tradium is one of the largest combination schools, and internationalization is very integrated into our organization. This was also the reason why, Tradium got the Danish award as being the International School of the year 2012.\r\n\r\nSince 2012, we enhanced the international work by sending out even more students and employees, while we have participated in several international projects. In previous mobility projects we have send out whole classes with approximately half grants, so everybody had the opportunity to receive a grant. In the 2014-project  we have given a full grant for all participants, with the result that we don't have more than 26 student mobilities left.\r\n\r\nWith this project we apply primarily for grants for mobility in the year 2015/2016, but we have also added some elected classes for 2016/2017. This application is the result of an internal application process, where the departments of Tradium have fulfilled an internal application based on their needs for future mobilities in their department.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities for the year 2016/2017 are for the classes that have integrated the mobilities as a mandatory part of their training and the mobility project to Glasgow (which has been completed the last many years). This type of mobilities we are 100% certain will be realized, and that is why it would be right to inform all the relevant stakeholders about the economic conditions earlier on. For this reason we have applyed for 2016/2017 mobilities for these special classes as well, a total of 101 mobility grants for students + 3 accompanying persons.\r\n\r\nThe project is implemented in continuation of Tradiums strategy of having a global vision, and thus to the desire to integrate internationalization into all of the programs offered by Tradium. The Mobility project is a very important element in this strategy.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we wish to send out 188 VET students, 92 HHX students and 35 employees. VET students are primarily basic course students at either GF1 or GF2, but there are also individual students from the main program (school training students). We are applying for grants to accompanying persons to our basic course students, as these students are relatively young (some are under 18), and many times they are not strong linguistically / culturally. HHX students are all first-year students from the school's two international study programs. Staff members come from all parts of the school: Managers, teachers and administrative staff.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the mobility project will be in extension of the enclosed MoU / LOI. There will be an increased focus on getting participants' learning outcomes described in a better way (ECVET), partly by using Learning Agreements for the description of the individual's learning outcomes, and assessed by the host partner. At the same time we will maintain the Europass Mobility as a recognition of the skills that the participant has achieved during the mobility.\r\n\r\nExpected effect for students:\r\nThe project will help to increase students' linguistic, international and intercultural competencies. Particularly VET students often have a limited global vision, which makes it difficult for them to operate in an international environment. With this project, they will be better to compete with other groups of students on internships and jobs. Regarding HHX / HTX participants, they also need a practical approach to their theoretical education. The work placements for these students will add this dimension. It is expected that most students will have a better chance of employment in the global labor market. They can also act as a pioneer and inspire other students to study abroad.\r\n\r\nExpected effect for employees / organization:\r\n\u2022 Employees / managers achieve linguistic, international and intercultural skills so that the organization will be able to support the students mobility.\r\n\u2022 Employees are provided with relevant professional qualification in their field, as well as greater power to integrate the international aspect in their training\r\n\u2022 Teachers get new inspiration for teaching and new pedagogical methods and tools\r\n\u2022 Management and administration gain new skills and inspiration (management, organization, planning, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe results of the mobility project will be evaluated and disseminated, internally as well as externally.

Internationalization is a beacon for Tradium, and it is included in the strategic, tactical and operational levels. In 2012, Tradium was recognized with the international prize for our international engagement.  After the changes following OK13 and EUD reform in 2015, we have been concerned about the development within international activities, for example, mobility projects (timewise, resources as well as structural). Luckily, our experience is that many of our departments have made a priority to implement mobility projects. Within our vocational education, it is now typical that our EUX students in the beginning of their education and training, as well as our school internship students have had the opportunity to use the mobility grants to travel to one of our partner schools. After the restructuring of the vocational educations, it has been assessed that the options of mobility projects has been more constricted. With the agreement of OK13 the costs have been more considerably higher than before. Our upper secondary education continues to make mobility grants a priority.  We are applying for mobility grants altogether for 132 students, 22 accompaying persons and 19 staff. Our total mobility activity will continue to be high, albeit at a lower level than before. A large majority of our mobility\u2019s are planned for implementation for the school year 2016/2017. The mobility grants we are applying for regarding school year 2017/2018 are for the educations that thru the years have completed mobility exchanges and/or where we have a partnership with another school (MoU).Our mobility grants from 2014 are at the moment nearly used up (1 student grant left, and 2 grants for staff) These 3 mobility grants are expected to be completed in spring 2016.From mobility project 2015 at the moment there are 75 mobility grants planned (out of 164), and 9 (out of 26) mobility grants for staff are under planning.All previous mobility grants have been used up 100% except for one project from 2013, where we with a mistake hadn\u2019t requested the transfer of mobility grants from accompanying person to mobility of students (but just did it in reality) this resulted in a non-approval of that part of our mobility project.  We are applying for accompanying persons because a great part of our students are relatively young (under 18 yrs. old), and for many of these students this is the first time meeting professionals from the business community. The staff comes from all parts of the school, and the people in charge of education in the businesses. Implementation of mobility grants will happen in connection with the attached MoU/LoI. There will be greater focus on learning outcomes of our students, for example by incorporating Learning Agreements describing a specific students learning outcomes assessed by the partner school. We will continue to use Europass Mobility documents to recognize the competences the participants have gained on the mobility.  Affects for students:This project will help increase the student\u2019s language, international and intercultural competences. Especially vocational educational students have had a limited global outlook, which has made it hard for them to interact in an international environment. With this project, it will make it easier to compete with other students on internships and jobs. Regarding HHX participants, there is the need for a practical approach to the otherwise theoretical education. The internship part of their mobility adds this dimension. Afterwards it is expected that most of these students will have a better chance for employment in a globalized work place. These students can also be a model for other students and inspire them to participate in a mobility project in another country. Expected effect on staff/institution:\u2022 Staff/leaders gain language, international and intellectual competences so that our institution can give our students better support in regards to their own mobility. \u2022 Our staff will receive a specific pedagogical and/or skills advancement in their field. \u2022 Teachers will gain new inspiration for their teaching methods and pedagogical methods and tools. \u2022 Leaders/executives will gain new competences around the building up of education systems and inspiration on how to tackle future challenges (EUDs attractiveness, counseling, absence, working together with the labour market, rationalization, digitalization and more).The results of these mobility projects at a minimum will be evaluated and discussed in their respective departments, for example in relation to teacher meetings.

NVTC is financially quite stable and well-managed. We organize mobilities both in Estonia and abroad for the learners and staff quite regularly and cover the expenses from our own budget. In 2015/2016 we have planned internships for 6 workers at partner schools. NVTC has planned to apply ECVET system from this academic year.

It offers a mixed academic and vocational curriculum and delivers qualifications from NVQ to BTEC First in the industrial and tertiary fields (sales, retail, hospitality management, administration) to around 365 students. \r\nA European section in English was launched in 2014 in order to develop cultural, professional and linguistic skills among students. This section is directed towards targeting pupils who are motivated and who study BTEC courses in sales, retail, hospitality management and administration. The course deals with international business as well as cultural and linguistic enhancement. \r\nVarious activities have been developed to help our students and ensure their progress and success. They are provided with schemes such as : mentoring or career guidance information day, they can visit local companies, they also have access to structures such as our school educational shop and company, they can take part in sports competitions, cultural projects, school trips abroad and even work placements in English-speaking countries.\r\nOur school has always made every effort to foster student achievement. We believe that in order to respond to the labour market needs that requires an increased mobility, it is vital for our school to move forward to a more concrete and efficient international opening. That is why we have decided to: open a European section, to send some of our teachers abroad, to receive some teachers from other countries for job shadowing exchanges (CIEP), to welcome regularly language assistants, to join the tourism-related occupations campus, to organise school trips, and to take part in eTwinning projects. We fully intend to continue to these programs to further our students\u2019 development and to help them pursue global-mindedness.\r\nFurthermore, thanks to our first European mobility project with the Erasmus+ programme that started in 2016, and will end in June 2018, 19 of our students ( mainly from the European section) had the opportunity to do a three-week work placement in Canterbury (UK) during their final year. On average over the last two years, we were able to involve 10.5% of students who reached the final year in a mobility project in Europe. Hence, our school has actively contributed to the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy (six percent of students aged 18 to 34 who have received their diplomas should engage in a learning or a work placement programme abroad).\r\nWithin this new Erasmus+ project, we wish to go even further and offer a four-week work placement in Ireland to students from Year 12 (Premi\u00e8re) and a three-week work placement to students from Year 13 (Terminale). Priority will be given to students who are part of the European section, while other students could join the project after an interview-selection process. We are prepared to continue our partnership with Canterbury until March 2019. However, as the UK prepares for the post-Brexit regulations, we may have to create a new partnership with an intermediary body in Dublin (Republic of Ireland) for the sake of practicality.\r\nWe aim to continue opening our students to the business world by allowing them to observe different professional practices in an English-speaking environment. This allows the student to prepare for the recruitment requirements after their BTEC (including HND training course) is completed, and also it helps them to integrate better into the world of work.\r\nOur students will be able to: improve their communicating and professional skills in real-world situations, to develop new work experience, to enhance their fluency in English, to gain confidence and autonomy. By completing all of these aforementioned tasks in these work placements, the students will have strengthened their chances to become more employable.\r\nThe students will gain practical experience to expand their CV.

So naturally there is a problem - the lack of qualified teachers working with these groups, successfully integrating them into training (learning) process. It is predicted that in the future the number of socially excluded and people from other cultures will grow in vocational training, therefore the problem mentioned is only getting worse.In view of the foregoing considerations a fundamental objective of the project is formulated - to prepare and implement social exclusion and other cultures\u2018 integration into Lithuanian vocational training, gain knowledge and practical skills from the experienced EU countries.

Implement measures to protect personal retraining and qualification development, training of the unemployed.3. To provide full support to students.4. To promote cultural openness, civic, environmental education.5. Strengthening the professional competencies of workers.The project aims to acquire the following competencies:1. Theoretical knowledge about social exclusion and individuals\u2018 from other cultural needs, their integration.2. Practical skills to organize the preparation of students, teachers, parents in the vocational school before the start of the integration.3. Practical skills in working with socially excluded and people from other cultures  in a vocational school; curriculum improvement.4. The ability to solve problems, to provide assistance and emergency management.5. The ability to cooperate.The target group of the participants in the project consists of teachers in various fields: social workers, psychologists, teachers. 24 project participants from three different Lithuanian vocational training institutions from different regions: Vilnius Vocational Education Centre of Technology and Business, Visaginas Technology and Business Vocational Training Centre and Kaunas Applied Arts school -  will go to a one week internship in the United Kingdom and Germany. 12 people will participate in each internship, including three representatives from each vocational training institution.Germany and England as directions for professional internships were chosen for the following reasons: they are one of the biggest centres of different ethnic cultures in Europe, the educational vocational training system of these countries has adapted to solving the problems associated with people other cultures and socially excluded inclusion in training, labor market and country's culture. During the professional internships in these countries project participants will get acquainted with the integration models into vocational training, educational, pedagogical and psychological support institutions of above-mentioned groups and relevant methodologies.Experience gained from the internship will definitely provide project participants with self-confidence in working with socially excluded persons and other students from different cultures. It is expected to reach a methodical and psychological preparation of the project participants, which could easily be transformed at Lithuanian vocational training institutions in organizing a successful integration of groups, which are socially vulnerable and from other cultures. This competence of the teaching staff is essential to good learning outcomes, easy adaptation in the labor market - is a precondition for successful self-realization for students who, because of their social status and cultural alienation have fewer opportunities.

Paul-Emile Victor\u2019s staff will exchange with their partner at Canterbury College on a regular basis so as to set up contracts and communicate on the needs, aims and priorities of each participant. They will work in tandem with their local representative to divide missions and tasks and produce mobility material. The documents such as the students\u2019 CVs, diaries, assessment grids, attendance grids\u2026 will allow students to prepare for their exams and certifications in the most efficient way (Europass, Europro, the Euro Section Distinction\u2026). PEV\u2019s staff, the partner and the employers set the deadlines together. This includes the preliminary visit by 2 teachers in October-November 2016, the trainees\u2019 induction on their first day at College, the monitoring of the placements by both parties and the final assessment on the last day on site. They would also agree on keeping in touch regularly to best meet the trainees\u2019 needs and to offer appropriate and reactive solutions in case of problems.This mobility project is a unique opportunity for our students to enrich themselves personally and professionally. They will no doubt gain the required skills for their CVs, which will enhance their employability and offer them better labour market outcomes. They will develop their European open-mindedness too. It will make vocational courses more attractive inside and outside school and encourage prospective applicants to join the Euro Section Class or the programme itself.Paul-Emile Victor\u2019s school will thus reinforce its partnership, do its best to promote itself locally and beyond in order to ensure further development and expand its European cooperation.", "http://www.canterburycollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-023540_1"], [2014, "TISEC in Europe or Taking Innovative Skills and Exchanging Competences in Europe", "Canterbury College", 20627.0, 2, 2, "The project TISEC in Europe - Taking Innovative Skills and Exchanging Competences  in Europe \u2013 consists in allowing 12 students in Terminal Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel in Plumbing, Installing water, heating and cooling systems to perform in January-February 2015 their period of compulsory work placement to complete their training in a European company.

Long observing a greater commitment of our students during their work placement, the development of a Leonardo project was clearly the solution.\r\nOur partner, the Canterbury College will receive our students during a week for 20 hours of educational, linguistic and cultural preparation in the morning. Then, in the afternoon, our students will work in plumbing workshops alongside English students.

This means that 13 out of 43 third grade students will participate in the Erasmus+ project supported by the European Union, and spend their three-month placement abroad.\r\nThey are all eligible to take part in the Erasmus+ programme because they have to do a three-month placement between the third and the fourth year of our school to be allowed to sit the final exams two years later. That\u00b4s why the school year ends for them at the end of May and starts again on the first Monday in October. They have to do their compulsory training within these four months.\r\nAt our school, there are two different focuses: 1. language and media and 2. wellness and health management. Most of the students have very good English skills as well as good Italian/French skills. Some of them have even attended optional subjects like Russian, wine-connoisseur, bar-keeper, patisserie, etc. \r\nDuring their placements abroad, students want to practise, strengthen as well as enlarge their practical as well as theoretical knowledge, which they have acquired in the first three years at our school. Furthermore, within this project, students will be given the chance to get to know a country which they might not know at all or only from a short holiday. Another important aim is to improve their language skills by making use of what they already know, internalizing it and expanding their vocabulary, etc. The latter will be supported by the OLS, Online Linguistic Support.\r\nWhich skills are to be focused on, will be put down in the Learning Agreements in accordance with teachers, employers and students. During the training (visits, reports from students and mentors), that is, afterwards - the achievement of these goals will be checked. Additional ECVET aspects included in the project are: Personal Transcript and Memorandum of Understanding which are to be signed in the course of visits in the respective countries. What\u00b4s new here are questionnaire in which partners are assessed by students. \r\nTaking part in this project is therefore useful for the students in many respects. By working in foreign countries they can consolidate, brush up and enlarge their practical as well as their language skills and thus significantly increase their chances on the job market. A further important aspect is that with the help of the Erasmus Plus project the students will crack prejudices, become more open-minded and tolerant. And last but not least, participants will become more mobile, even at an early age. \r\nThe results of the project will be published in local and regional newspapers, the school website, the yearbook, on FB, etc. Moreover, experienced project participants will pass their knowledge on to students who are thinking of going abroad in the following year at informative events not only at school but also outside of it.\r\nStaff mobility is another aspect that will be focused on again this year. Three teachers will do a job shadowing abroad, two at a school in Cuxhaven, Germany and one English/Spanish teacher at a school in Avila, Spain. The aims are to find out more about the school systems in the two countries and, of course, how classes work. What\u00b4s more, the two teachers who will spend a week at the German school want to find out more about the implementation of COOL (Cooperative Open Learning) in the classroom. This is something they are familiar with as well. Another thing they are interested in is the Theatre Company which they have had in Cuxhaven for year and is something we are aspiring to have as well.\r\nThe other teacher who is going to spend a week in Spain wants to form the basis for a future cooperation with the Spanish school, most likely in form of a School Exchange. By the way, this contact has its roots at Comenius training in Southampton where the Erasmus+ coordinator met a teacher from the Spanish school. A third visit is planned for Stockholm where two colleagues do a job-shadowing. HLW Wolfsberg, in return, is very much looking forward to welcoming representatives of the new partner schools in Wolfsberg.\r\nAnd finally, the coordinator of this project wants to pay GB a final visit, also to find out if and how a cooperation between the two countries will be possible after BREXIT.", "http://www.abbotsbartonhotel.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA116-039082_6"]]}}, "3NG": {"nhs": {"data": [["RVV", "Kent and Canterbury Hospital", "nhs_RVVKC"]]}}, "3RA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Not Just Number", "Kent Refugee Action Network", 26097.0, 7, 7, "Not Just Numbers: Migration and Asylum Issues in Youth Work\r\n \r\nNot Just Numbers is an international youth worker mobility project aimed at strengthening cooperation and developing capacity of youth organisations in dealing with migration and asylum issues.\r\n \r\nThe project is built on a needs analysis conducted by members of partner organisations in their communities and responds directly to needs and problems of their target groups \u2013 young people, notably those with fewer opportunities.\r\n \r\nThe project aims to improve the quality of local activities in the fields of migration and asylum awareness conducted by consortium members in their countries.
