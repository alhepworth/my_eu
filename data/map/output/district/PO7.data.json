Today, the influence of Music on people\u2019s mood and health is getting more and more reckoned as musical therapy is spreading. Due to the tight link between Music and Emotions, the suitable use of such resource might contribute to a positive emotional environment within the classroom, which would be ideal for learning purposes.\r\n\r\nOur school is a Secondary school which runs a project on bilingualism. Therefore, we feel the need to innovate our methodology as well as to improve the linguistic competences of part of our teachers. So, we suggest here analysing the use of Music as a methodological tool for the learning-teaching of English oral expression.\r\n\r\nOur main aims in this project are to integrate Music as a methodological resource in the school as well as to improve the oral skills of both pupils and teachers so that the communication in the classroom improves itself, and to strengthen our project on bilingualism. The use of new technologies as a means to reach our aims above and the study on body language as a tool in TFL through Music will be sought. All this will be done to eventually gain the growth of the school and the cultural dimension of an integrated Europe.\r\n\r\nNine teachers from four different departments will take part in the project. Two of them will follow courses on methodology, four teachers will participate in job shadowing in experienced schools and two teachers will take English courses to enable them reach competence enough to join the bilingual project. After the training process, the members in the project will eventually put the acquired knowledge into practice through the subjects they teach. Among other activities, didactic units will be developed, which will deal with the suprasegmental features in English through music. They will be put in practice on teachers first, then on pupils. A series of activities and a repertoire of songs \u2013the bases to work on both musical and linguistic grounds, will be collected. Also, two choreographies with a medley of songs as musical base will be developed. Finally, a comparative study on pronunciation will be rendered based on the audio sample and free software as a tool.\r\n\r\nAmong the long run benefits, the inclusion of music in daily life at school will help the teachers and pupils enjoy such a motivating and attractive element as part of several subjects. The departments will include such methodological principles in their plans and they will enjoy both the material and the methodological resources produced within the project. It will help the school bilingual project to consolidate and spread thanks to the participation of new coming teachers, which will result in the enhancing of the quality in education.

The group of the participating countries was formed partly on the base of co-operations in previous projects, partly on the base of recommendations by previous project partners.\r\nThe project idea was born seeing the common needs of the participating schools. Present-day teaching and learning environment struggles with the undermotivation of students not only in the lessons but also in out-of-classroom activities, specially designed for them. Attendance in these activities is low, irrespective from the fact whether it is a special school celebration or an entertaining activity.\r\nAnother challenge for the schools of the 21st century is using innovative tools like ICT in the classroom.  Some schools (Estonian, Finnish) are more experienced in this area than the others, but having new applications and tools issued every day, we feel that it is not easy to cope and keep pace with the speed of the spread of the new technology.\r\n Seeing these two big challenges that are characteristic for each school, we decided to find a common solution to handle them: we are working on the topic of special days in our lives using the tools of modern information technology.

Their overall well-being has declined and there are more  sleeping disorders and health problems. Many students still do not see environmental questions as their personal issue, and don\u2019t take part in any community work. Objectives: Our main goal is to link schools more closely to the surrounding community and environment.  Implementing new applications into science, and peer tutoring and stress-relieving exercises into classrooms will increase students\u00b4motivation and improve declining scholastic results. Due to the increased use of computer based educational tools, the time students sit at computers has multiplied so it is important to create activities that make them physically more active. Another important aim is to become more aware of the different characteristics of urban nature and the natural environment and to make students fully aware of their ecological footprint .

The students are between 14-18 and both they and their teachers will represent different academic fields. Many students have economic and geographical obstacles, and educational difficulties.  Description of activities:  1. Students and teachers will get to know each other, survival language courses are designed, the project website and eTwinning Twinspace will be created.2. Kick-off project meeting in Finland (autumn 2016): The project work will be carefully designed and responsibilities shared. The timetable will be set.

However, the presence of these factors does not always mean that a young person will become an offender. Risk factors for school and youth violence include: \u2022 Prior history of violence \u2022 Drug, alcohol, or tobacco use \u2022 Association with delinquent peers \u2022 Poor family functioning \u2022 Poor grades in school \u2022 Poverty in the communityIn 2004, on Council of Europe initiative, the young around the Europe prepared the European Act for the Democratic and Non-Violent Schools based on the basic values and principles shared by all the Europeans, especially the values featured in the European Convention Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. These young people suggest that schools around the Europe should look over this act for it using as a model to promote democratic and non-violent schooling.The best of the school stakeholders are teachers, students, parents, environmental schools and the relevant units of the Ministry.

Roller transport limits and potentially prohibits fine detail treatment and reduces yield (to 10% in extreme cases) due to damage caused by contact with such rollers. Current technology employs long process tanks and slow speeds to minimise contact damage. In applications where contact is of less concern rollers still limit capability as the force required to turn them results stretching or breaking of the foil limiting foil type, thickness, and process residence times.\nFluid Foil will provide frictionless, non-contact, modular transportation and fluid delivery technologies that enable chemical processing of any feature size without risk of damage to the web. Extremely low re-wind tensions enable processing of thin delicate and porous materials. Web processing density of 30 meters of web per linier meter of system dramatically increases processing speeds and most importantly places no limit on web length. Modular control software will complete activities such as data logging and real time fault analysis.\nFluid Foil will have the capacity to accelerate innovation printed, organic & flexible electronics as well as enabling potential new markets to emerge (e.g. graphene, e-textiles and paper products). This will be achieved via the provision of low cost and adaptable machinery to fabricators, opening up chemical processing to SMEs. The commercial aim of the project is to limit the time-intensive work that goes into the customisation of machines and software and reduce the lead time and cost to the customer while increasing our output.Our goal for the overall project is to develop and build a suite of demonstrator modules which will help generate customer confidence and gain orders from early adopters before we go on to license the system.", 39196.0, 55994.0, 1, 1, "Fluid Foil", null, null, null, "h2020_200617_924386333"]]}}, "7XJ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1483228800000, 1496188800000, "A REVOLUTIONARY PORTABLE AND ENVIROMENTALLY SOLUTION FOR CHEWING GUM REMOVAL USING STEAM ON DEMAND TECHNOLOGY", "Spirit Circuits Limited", "Chewing gum seems like a fairly innocuous substance until you step on it or sit on, or until you are faced with removing it from footpaths and public places.

Indeed, WBL and transnational mobility experiences are important to (re)motivate VET learners (preventing early school leaving) and to provide them with the competences required by the companies. \r\n\r\nTherefore the DUAL MOB project will give students the chance to develop technical competences and soft skills \r\nthrough WBL mobility experiences abroad. These experiences will be carried out during VET qualification path and with the final aim of assessing and validating the learning outcomes acquired during the mobility so as to facilitate future inclusion of the young participants in the labor market or to continue their studies.\r\nThe project will involve 300 students (1/3 suffering from economic/social/cultural disadvantage) enrolled in VET courses in one of the 150 VET Centres run by the Consortium Members in 18 Italian Regions. \r\n\r\nThe project has a wide sectorial and geographical coverage.
