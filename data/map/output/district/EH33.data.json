The policy is to be fully implemented by 2020 and the school has already engaged actively with the teaching of French across all stages. The school is now looking towards the implementation of Spanish as the 2nd additional language for all learners and has indicated this as a key action within the school improvement plan. Staff within the school have indicated an interest in the project to engage them in further development of their own language development, while allowing them to acquire new skills and knowledge in the teaching of languages. As a school we have identified the LFEE immersion courses as the best process by which we can meet these needs. With support from school management and the local authority development officer the application has been completed and staff have been made aware of the expectations of them through participation in the course.\r\nAfter the course participants will be more confident in their language skills and will apply this in the teaching of languages across the school. Through a range of collegiate activities they will share their knowledge and experience with others and develop the language teaching programme within the school. Our progress in the teaching of languages will be monitored through a range of processes to ensure we are providing valuable, relevant and engaging learning experiences for all pupils.\r\nAs a school we will engage in wider engagement with languages by encouraging the school and local community to participate in language activities throughout the school year.

On this respect, the SMILE project will demonstrate different innovative technological and non-technological solutions in large-scale smart grid demonstration projects in the Orkneys, Sams\u00f8 and Madeira islands, paving the way for their introduction in the market in the near future. The technological solutions vary from: integration of battery technology, power to heat, power to fuel, pumped hydro, electric vehicles, electricity stored on board of boats, an aggregator approach to demand side management (DSM) and predictive algorithms.\nThe pilots will demonstrate operation of the distribution grid under stable and secure conditions to implement solutions for demand response, intelligent control and automation of distribution networks; they have high shares of RES in the electricity grid or have planned increasing shares in the next years. All of them will demonstrate stable grid operation with use of storage solutions and smart integration of grid users from transport.\nEach pilot will test the most appropriate solutions for local specificities, and common lessons with cross-cutting valence will be derived. Involving projects on islands will ease engaging residents in SMILE. Indeed, islanders are usually sensible to provide availability to test solutions impacting their daily life. Finally, two of the pilots are not total energy islands, thus representing smart grids located on the mainland and not limiting replication potential to other island locations only.\nSMILE consortium is composed by 19 partners from 6 EU countries: all the value chain actors needed to efficiently implement the 3 projects have been involved and an innovation management approach will guarantee a wider exploitation and replication of technological solutions.", 606177.0, 12234763.0, 6, 19, "SMILE", null, null, null, "h2020_210038_938124734"], [1475452800000, 1601596800000, "Smart building retrofitting complemented by solar assisted heat pumps integrated within a self-correcting intelligent building energy management system.", "Sunamp Limited", "Heat4Cool proposes an innovative, efficient and cost-effective solution to optimize the integration of a set of rehabilitation systems in order to meet the net-zero energy standards.

Modulation of pre-mRNA splicing by exon skipping is the most promising molecular intervention in DMD. 2 Phase Ib and 2 Phase IIa clinical trials (MDEX Consortium in collaboration with Sarepta Therapeutics; a Dutch Consortium) demonstrated that delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) to mediate exon skipping of exon 51 were able to return specific DMD mutations in-frame (~13% of all mutations) leading to new dystrophin protein expression after intramuscular and systemic delivery. The Dutch study of repeated 2-O-methylated phosphorothioate (2OMe) AO administration suggested limited efficacy after 5 weeks of treatment. Our MDEX Consortium study using a morpholino (PMO) AO demonstrated a clear dose response, robust dystrophin restoration and reduction of muscle inflammation after 12 weeks at doses up to 20mg/Kg, with no drug related adverse events. This, and preclinical studies focused on level of protein expression, clearly indicate that PMO have a superior therapeutic index compared to 2OMe. New PMOs are needed to target other DMD mutations. We will develop a PMO to skip exon 53 and perform a clinical trial in DMD boys using a world leading pan-European consortium. This will allow us to advance this class of PMO therapy in DMD by i. assessing the safety and efficacy of targeting another exon; ii. exploring the use of non-invasive techniques to monitor dystrophin restoration. This new PMO will be administered over 12 weeks in 3 groups, each of 4 DMD boys, receiving between 4 to 30mg/kg or placebo. If well tolerated, all boys will be treated for another 24 weeks at a dose of 30mg/kg. Safety and dystrophin restoration in a muscle biopsy at the end of this period will be the study endpoints.
