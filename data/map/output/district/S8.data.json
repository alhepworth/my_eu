The 3 groups involved in this exchange carried on a dialogue after the seminar and between them agreed the young disabled people themselves should have a first-hand input into the debate and to have a forum to learn from each other in the same way and to provide information to inform policy makers in their respective situations.  The participants are all young people with learning disability, some with physical disability also and have in common experiences highlighting the challenges and barriers existing in providing meaningful training and employment opportunities for themselves.  The activities will include a mixture of non-formal exchanges of ideas and information giving sessions by each country group, outlining respective situations to enable comparisons and joint learning and awareness raising. The majority of the activities will be visiting a range of training and employment facilities in Sheffield to witness good practice and to participate first hand in some of the initiatives thus facilitating experiential learning.  There will be some general activities to enable participants to learn about life generally in each others' countries.\r\nThe young people involved have limited intellectual skills and, as such, activities have to be tailor-made, at a slower pace and include significant non-structured time to enable concentration skills to be high and each piece of learning to be consolidated before going on to the next.

This is partly due to the lack of role models within the family, or complex family situations that apparently limit the aspirations of the individual. \r\nThe objective of this project is simple; to make it easier for all students to see that success is available to all through quality education and sound careers guidance.\r\nWe now need to evaluate our own practice and the practice of others across different European nations to examine the way in which we instill ambitions and encourage all individuals to make themselves an active member of  a global society, with good career prospects, especially those from a more disadvantaged background. We strongly believe that through working with teenagers in other countries, our most vulnerable students who for some have never left the country will develop a desire to raise their own ambitions and aspirations, and even consider aspiring to work in another European country in their long term career.\r\nThis project should therefore help students to identify what career pathway they want to pursue, increase their desire and efforts to succeed academically to achieve the best grades possible to get the jobs they really want to pursue in later life. This will help us as a consortium of schools to narrow the gap and improve attainment for the lower academic achievers in all our schools.\r\nWe will recruit a team of 30 'Employability ambassadors'  aged 13-16 in each of the 4 schools who will contribute to the project over the next two years, each of them visiting 1 other partner school to explore similarities and differences between the career education and pathways, employment prospects and employability skills in each country. They will then produce (with support from teachers, mentors and business partners) 4 key intellectual outputs - A guide, website, App, and lesson plans to help raise awareness of the importance of and improve Employability skills of other European teenagers. The expected result will be better job prospects for all users as they develop the skills that employers are looking for on a local, national and perhaps International level. Activities will include: \r\nInitial interviews on camera and via attitudinal surveys about careers and employability skills development; develop hypothesis on employability and test this against local employers\u2019 attitudes; devise a menu of employability and aspiration/ambition projects; develop some of these and test, rate and review; select the best and most valuable 3 projects to partners and trade; publish and share via website and App; evaluate wider impact and use reviewing tools to measure/gauge strength of a project though online survey and App quiz; Feedback and disseminate to media and educational groups in all 4 countries; complete and be awarded employability passports at a grand ceremony at the end of the 2 year project.\r\n In terms of methodology we will employ the PDR cycle of improvement for each project.\r\nExpected outcomes and results will include:\r\nAll participants to achieve more positive scores re: school reviews e.g. all green on track to achieve best results possible for the individual; All participants to have a clearer aspirational life/career plan; All participants to have a much greater attitudinal scores than the baseline data; All participants able to articulate and demonstrate what employability skills are and how to improve life chances through an international employability passport signed and endorsed by all partner schools.\r\nLong term - As part of the study we will look to receive updates and follow up from the participant ambassadors well into their future employment, with a plan to bring them back on an annual basis into school to promote their achievements and the work that helped them to get into employment. We would hope that in the longer term, the resources will be used by a wide variery of schools both on a national and International scale thanks to the shared website/App development and users will improve their employability skills to help them become 'work ready' and achieve their first job or training course beyond age 16.", "http://www.meadowhead.sheffield.sch.uk", "Meadowhead School Academy Trust", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000066_coordinator"], [2017, "Full STEAM Ahead: Creating teenage ambassadors of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths across Europe.", "Meadowhead School Academy Trust", 102905.0, 3, 3, "This project builds on our successful KA1 work shadowing project for STEM leaders and comprises 2 key objectives: \r\n\r\n1. To increase uptake and raise the profile in schools of not only the traditional STEM subjects of Science, Technology and Maths, but also (through involving the 'A' for Arts to add a creative and very visual dynamic to this project) to drive uptake of the Arts, including linguists to increase uptake of English, German and Spanish subjects in all 3 schools.  \r\n\r\n2. To improve staff and student knowledge and skills required to follow careers in STEAM areas of industry.\r\nEach school will recruit and train a team of teenage ambassadors to promote STEAM career pathways, lead events, and ignite passion and excitement into these subjects amongst their peers. \r\n\r\nThis project is innovative as none of the partners have worked with students before to promote these subjects within their own school, or used the digital/creative Arts as a vehicle to facilitate the desired outcomes (animation, video, digital imagery, 3d models). \r\n\r\nNumber/profile of participants: \r\nThere will be at least 4 STEAM based curriculum leaders in each country,  and at least 2 business partners, 2 senior leaders, a University partner and a project manager in each country. There will be 60 ambassadors (20 per school) aged 14-18 studying STEAM subjects and each group of 10 will travel to either partner school to carry out collaborative work with the 2 other partner schools.\r\n\r\nActivities will involve: \r\nEach partner will lead specialist workshops during the student exchanges focusing on their strongest associated curriculum area of each school: UK school (ARTS), German school (SCIENCE/MATHS), Spanish school (TECHNOLOGY and ENGINEERING).\r\nWe know from experience that by using peer pressure in a positive way, and cross-cultural collaborative working with overseas partners and employers, our students can be effective ambassadors and drivers of change and uptake in STEAM in all 3 schools. \r\n\r\nYear 1 -Autumn term project meeting in UK to finalize the work plan and devise STEAM student ambassador recruitment schedule & baseline audit questionnaire. Each school recruits 20 STEM ambassadors whose role will be to devise events and marketing materials to promote STEM subjects and associated careers in each school. They will work towards a STEAM ambassador employability skills passport. \r\nSpring term - First 10 ambassadors from each country visit Spanish partner school to undertake collaborative Technology workshops led by school, with input from University of San Jorge and employers, visits to local Technology/engineering related companies to discuss STEM related career opportunities for students and employer attitudes to education of these subjects; meetings with careers staff and employers to enhance students' employability skills. \r\n\r\nYear 2 - Teacher Evaluation meeting will take place prior to second mobility of next 10 ambassadors to visit German school to undertake similar programme of activities as in Year 1, but with focus on Science and Maths .\r\n\r\nYear 3 - Third and final visit of final 10 ambassadors to UK partner school with collaborative workshops focussed on the Creative Arts. Student ambassadors to host high profile dissemination event (linked to National Science and Education week) to showcase findings and promote their work to a large audience of internal/external stakeholders invluding video, animation and a Photographic exhibition. End of project teacher evaluation meeting to take place in Germany in July.\r\n\r\nImpact: \r\nShort term benefits will include improved STEAM knowledge, skills and confidence of participants, increased uptake of STEAM subjects in all schools, as well as improved links to University STEAM departments and local STEAM based businesses. All STEAM ambassadors will have achieved the STEAM Skills passport and Youthpass certificate by the end of Year 3.\r\n\r\nLonger term - \r\nAll students on the programme will have access to a quality STEAM work experience placement. Participants will be required to train future cohorts of STEAM ambassadors when they enter their Post 16 education as part of their enrichment, which will ensure sustainability of the programme in future years in all schools. STEM subjects will enjoy a higher profile in each school and increased uptake at GCSE and A-Level or equivalent qualification.

The project aims to provide post-16 Language students in Spain/Germany/England to gain invaluable insight into the European job market by completing a week-long work placement in a local business of the host country as well as increase their linguistic skills, which will benefit them in their exams and encourage the study of languages beyond A -level . Each school is looking to send up to two staff with ten post-16 students (in case of the English school they will include 10 students for Spanish and 10 for German) on the work placement visits and will seek to accommodate the students in private housing on an exchange stay basis, or, where necessary, in alternative appropriate accommodation. This work experience will be carried out in 2015 and 2016, thus implying the participation of 80 students in the mobilities. The fact of repeating the work experience has the clear aim of improving the collaboration system with the companies, as well as having the opportunity to compare results and analyse them.\r\nThe main activities will involve: work experience placement in Germany/Spain/England for one week in local businesses, completion of a variety of tasks within each company under the close supervision of a dedicated member of staff, completion of a log book by the students about their experiences each day, meetings with staff in the companies to discuss educational and cultural particularities and differences between the countries, educational and cultural visits to local attractions in the evening and at weekend, monitoring and evaluation meetings during and after the visits. Students will also learn about the language at work, necessary skills to write a CV, European standards related to academic recognition, and the differences among the educational systems of the partners involved, so as to broaden their knowledge and make them aware of the importance of getting to know other systems to gain confidence and attain success.\r\nBefore the Work Experience experience all the post 16 students will have the opportunity to acquire language and employability skills as they will be taught about how to do research of a foreign company, how to manage in a work experience abroad, etc. as we pretend that the project has an impact in as many students as possible, not only those participating in the mobilities.\r\nThe work-experience project will improve students\u2019 linguistic skills, their interpersonal skills and their awareness of the international employment market. During the project students will practise their CV writing skills in a foreign language, they will improve their research skills of foreign companies, improve their interpersonal skills when communicating with the foreign employers and their host families and will gain vital working skills in a foreign company. All of this will impact positively on the students\u2019 exam results and increase their employability in the future.\r\nThe expected long-term benefit would be a successful work-related project between the three partner schools sustained in the future which will impact on the whole-school and local community. The post-16 provision in each school will be enhanced and lead to a wider appreciation of language learning in a global world.  The Guideline for both students and teachers about how to start a work experience at school and why might be useful tool for our schools, and we hope that also for other schools in Europe, who are willing to start such an experience. The school material developed for the didactic unit may also proof to be of great value, and it can be improved every time it is used at any school. \r\nThe project will also have an impact on the local businesses\u2019 exposure within the wider (European) community through the dissemination and evaluation publications produced by the students upon completion of the project.

Deemed as a 'Good' school by Ofsted, two-thirds of its students choose to study A-Levels at the school. It is awaiting a new Sixth form centre extension. Space for teaching and learning is problematic so innovative curriculum design, strong leadership, and maintaining staff morale pose key challenges during this difficult time. \r\n\r\nThe school has an ageing yet very experienced senior leadership team, and a training need for middle managers who aspire to become senior leaders, but lack the experience and quality training. Succession planning is a key priority. The school must market itself and its International ethos successfully to recruit, train and maintain staff well-being to retain the best teaching and support staff, and to train and develop aspiring leaders to fulfil some key school management roles in the future.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this application is to secure much needed funding to address these issues through bespoke and innovative leadership and management training courses in Europe, which will result in a positive impact on the school leadership strategy.\r\nOne of the 4 key whole school 2016-19 improvement priorities focusses on leadership and management, with 6 strands; Clarity of vision, values and priorities; high shared expectations and standards; rigorous quality assurance; leadership at all levels; staff development; resource development and management.  \r\n\r\nTo improve our school leadership and management, we will send 20 key staff to Sweden or Poland over the next two years to complete bespoke training courses. We are targeting aspiring leaders, and although we will adopt a fair and transparent internal application process, we expect participants to include Y7-Y13 Year team staff (comprising 7 Heads of Year and 7 pastoral managers) 1 SEN Manager, 1 Communications Manager, and 4 Curriculum leaders (some of these are Assistant Headteachers). These key staff aspire to lead the school in future and assume management roles.

This will have a positive impact on teaching and learning and raising of aspirations for staff and students.  They will modify systems and aspects of the curriculum to embed best practice observed during the project. \r\n\r\nLonger term, staff will be better skilled, happy and more confident in their ability to progress to leadership roles, to fill gaps left behind by the SLT as they leave or retire, and this will allow us to improve succession planning.

However, it is a reality within our School that rates of female students who undertake Technical Areas directly linked to STEM throughout all different educational levels, are still very low and in a near future they are to be displaced from a labor market where staff recruitment is clearly rising.  We need therefore to implement strategies for women to break the \"fear\" to access technical areas related to STEM and to encourage their interest in these disciplines in all educational levels we offer from the Fundaci\u00f3n San Valero of Secondary Education, \"Bachillerato\"and VET.

These activities will be complemented with companies, business associations and women's association\u2019s visits and meetings, in order to better understand status of women's access to STEM.\r\nAfter mobility activities take place, teachers are expected to acquire new skills in teaching methods and its implementation in the classroom, thus improving their teaching work in the STEM area, as well as strategies to motivate female students towards Stem, promoting gender equality. Motivation towards teaching work and the ability to become an ambassador with the rest of the teaching staff will be reinforced. As for the long-term impact, hopefully the number of female students at different levels of education accessing STEM areas are to increase, incorporation of new innovative teaching methods into STEM areas will be added to the School Innovation Plan and finally ties will be strengthen with all European partner schools by applying for a KA2 proposal in following Erasmus+ calls where female student mobility will be included.", "http://www.meadowhead.sheffield.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-037516_3"], [2014, "Innovation and Modernisation of STEM teaching & learning at Meadowhead.", "Meadowhead School Academy Trust", 3762.0, 3, 3, "Our project will be mainly one of raising the profile of the STEM subjects of Science, Technology and Maths as well as improving the staff competences / expertise with CPD for specific staff within the STEM subjects of Science, Maths and Technology. \r\nWe are aiming to have two key staff within each of these three areas who are keen to improve their practice and are able to job shadow staff within the partner schools. \r\nThe participants that will be involved will be key staff within Meadowhead School who are able to make a difference with the new knowledge gained from the project and also be able to disseminate this information effectively within their faculties.
