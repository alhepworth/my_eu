The trainers take part in them as JOB-SHAWDOWING in the same companies where students are developing their internship abroad. Five will be chosen for a week period (9 days with the journey). Therefore, the main aim of this project is to enrich students with an experience abroad linked with a significant improvement in the learning of our students since it gives a global vision of the sector requests in the main countries in Europe. Employment has had barriers, however, nowadays, since our society has a cosmopolitan feature we need to train our students in companies of brother nations in Europe. Besides, that would mean a possibility to start their professional life there.

Previous EU projects focused on awareness raising campaigns and suggested that match-fixing is a relatively unexplored research area that requires more systematic empirical study; prevention efforts should be evidence-based and multidimensional, and multiple stakeholders should be involved. Project FtF was developed in order to address each of these areas by developing a European-wide strategic partnership between academic institutions and sports organizations, in order to empower and strengthen the fight against match fixing. Project partners will work together with those at risk for match fixing in order to develop an innovative, web-based education tool (FtF Tool). This web-based tool will target those at risk for match fixing, and will be used as an educational resource for effective interventions.The objectives of FtF project are to: 1. Measure public and stakeholder atittudes, values, norms and expectations towards match-fixing as a threat to the integrity of sport. 2. Identify trends in match-fixing discourse and public views at a massive scale by analyzing public and open social media data. 3. Co-create an evidence-based education tool with multiple stakeholders in the field of sport that will increase their awareness about corruption, fraud and match-fixing in different types and levels of sport; teach coping skills on resisting offers and temptations to engage in match-fixing; and indicate ways to properly report match-fixing incidents to the relevant authorities.4. Develop policy recommendations to guide further education and training of stakeholders about match-fixing in sports, and accordingly inform existing and ongoing EU-level policy initiatives.", null, null, "erasmus_567159-EPP-1-2015-2-EL-SPO-SCP_1"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "ICSS INSIGHT", 33971.0, "Developing the European dimension in sport (15.02.03)", "fts_2017_33555"]]}}}}
