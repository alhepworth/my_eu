Most of them are scarce in EU and of poor purity, being mixed within complex and low grade aggregates which need to be processed by means of a separation process consuming high quantities of energy and water, and even in some cases this makes its exploitation unfeasible due to production costs. \nBeing EU dependent on some of these materials, as identified by EIP initiative, our society is demanding more efficient extracting processes to contribute to major European independency on these Critical Raw Materials.\nTungsten and Tantalum ores are two recognized CRMs: In a market currently dominated by China and Russia production (among others), in Europe Tungsten (limited) production is mostly concentrate into UK, Spain and Portugal . On the other side, Tantalum is a key element on electronics with clear EU external production dependency, as it is naturally really scarce in Europe (only 1% of world production is concentrated in EU). \nKnowing this situation, OptimOre Project proposes the research and development of modelling and control technologies, using advanced sensing and advanced industrial control by means of artificial intelligence techniques, for the more efficient and flexible Tantalum and Tungsten ores processing from crushing to separation process, with the participation of relevant international players in the mining field on research (Chalmers University- Dr. Magnus Evertsson, Exeter University with Dr. Richard Pascoe, Freiburg University with Dr. Holberg Lieberwirth, among others).

The objective is to develop a safety system which will detect and provide early warning about a number of conditions that can pose a danger to those underground. It will be based on low cost and low consumption communication technology, which offers robust conditions in front of electromagnetic disturbances. The basic system will include a number of nodes along the underground space, located in the upper limits of the walls (Static Nodes). The different nodes have to be situated sight-to-sight with at least 2 nodes, accomplishing the\ncommunication channel. Visitors will wear specifically designed nodes (mobile nodes), which will communicate with static nodes.\nThe system will include the following characteristics and capabilities: i) Only power wire is needed, in order to power supply to wall routers; ii) Low maintenance cost; iii) Low cost; iv) Robustness: IP compliant for hazardous ambient; v) Static node sensing of temperature, humidity, light, pressure, sound and gas (O, CO, CO2) sensing capabilities; vi) specialized static nodes for vibration sensing and landslide detection vii) mobile nodes.'", 113395.0, 1143247.0, 5, 9, "UNDERSAFE", null, "http://www.interkonsult.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/149392.jpg", "fp7_100443_964804390"]]}}, "7NB": {"cordis": {"data": [[1280620800000, 1375228800000, "Development of an efficient heating and cooling technology system for rotational moulding, which will \u2013dramatically reduce cycle time, product cost and energy consumption", "Trent Mouldings Limited", "Rotational Molding is a very competitive manufacturing method for producing large hollow plastic products. It provides one advantage over other plastic processing technologies: production of seamless articles, with uniform wall thickness and complex shapes for sectors as chemical storage, toys, construction and transports. However this technology has stuck without major innovative improvements in last years becoming energy inefficient and costly, and at the same time other techniques which have substantially improved (as injection moulding or blowing moulding) are not suitable for such large pieces. Moreover, it has to face up to the growing market of low cost plastic goods from China and India. As a result, rotational moulding industry with high labour and energy costs becomes one of the most vulnerable sectors of Plastic Processing Industry. Therefore, this sector needs to research and develop technology innovations in order to provide plastic industry of high value added products which manufacturing will allow it to reduce energy consumption and production costs. The challenge is the development of low energy systems in order to enhance the energy efficiency and reduce the cycle time, without becoming more expensive. The solution proposed is an automatic rotational molding machine with the following systems: -Induction Heating System. This system will use a medium frequency power supply and helical induction coils to generate heat within the mold. It will integrate a thermal insulating layer between the coil and the mold to avoid heat losses. -Internal Cooling System. The new technology will be integrated an internal cooling system which it will consist of ionic liquids. This system will remove heat from internal mould atmosphere, reducing the cooling time. In addition, it will provide low pressure to the polymer when it has reached melt point in order to improve the mechanical properties of the final product and to reduce cycle times.", 271287.0, 2264090.0, 6, 13, "ROTOFAST", null, "http://www.rototek.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112729.jpg", "fp7_95349_957620182"]]}}}}
