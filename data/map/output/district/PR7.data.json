We need to improve teachers\u2019 confidence in using the target language and incorporate authentic materials into our schemes of work that would trigger pupils\u2019 curiosity and heighten level of interest and attainment, creating a true German or Spanish environment in MFL classrooms. We would like to develop links with other schools around the world, creating contacts in Spain and Germany on which to base school trips/exchanges and raise pupils\u2019 cultural awareness, developing global citizens. We also want to share good practice from other countries, including how to develop literacy and narrow the performance gap between pupil premium students and the rest of the cohort.\r\n\r\nWe want to engage more with our feeder primary schools and create pupil-led projects on specific area to be presented to twinned schools or younger pupils. \r\n\r\nWe want to boost confidence in speaking in foreign languages and help the students speak more spontaneously. \r\n\r\nWe would like to achieve these targets through developing the project over the course of two years involving two members of staff from the MFL Department taking part in training courses in Spain and Germany.

We will be able to acquire better learning strategies and more authentic and relevant resources. In addition to this, we will develop a link with the school in Spain and Germany. We will provide children with opportunities to regularly communicate with their Spanish and German partners through the use of ICT and eTwinning. This will give them a real audience, purpose and context of the communication and allow them to get to know young people of their own age in these countries and realise that they have a lot in common. This will lead to better enjoyment of language learning and more uptake of languages at GCSE and above.\r\n\r\nThis project will increase the  language skills and intercultural knowledge of staff leading to more purposeful, relevant learning. There will be better support for children on our pupil premium register to narrow their performance gap and a vast increase in pupils cultural awareness and global citizenship.\r\n\r\nWe will develop school trips and exchanges to Spain and Germany and increase provision including extracurricular clubs and celebration events.
