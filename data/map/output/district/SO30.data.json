Ensuring sustainable land use is a key challenge, yet hard to achieve in today\u2019s interconnected world where policies, consumer demands and environmental change in one region may affect far-away places. We face a significant knowledge gap regarding the processes related to land use that link distant places \u2013 or telecouplings \u2013 and how these processes could be governed towards sustainability. Companies, institutions and policy makers lack the expertise and tools to ensure sustainable land use in a globalised world. COUPLED will educate researchers and entrepreneurs in assessing and governing land use in a systemic way, accounting for the opportunities and threats arising from distal links between Europe and other regions. COUPLED builds on a strong interdisciplinary network to achieve its overall objective of operationalising the novel telecouplings concept in order to support sustainable governance of land systems and related supply chains under global change. COUPLED will deliver on training a new generation of professionals and entrepreneurs, developing rich analytic tools and new understandings to help private and public organisations to identify where and how they can intervene to make sustainable land use decisions, thereby avoiding unwanted outcomes. The consortiums unites scientifically excellent partners across the natural and social sciences to ensure excellence in research, institutional and technological innovation. Working closely with large companies, SMEs, NGOs, international organisations and administrative bodies, the ESRs will learn how to move between science and practice, become highly attractive to employers, and build successful careers in research, consulting, industry or governance.

It is designed to engage primarily individual growers and small-scale farmers across Europe, and to enable them to develop new wisdom and innovative practices through the collective power of shared and open data and knowledge. Citizens contributing data will gain access to the first single-source comprehensive crop and watering advice service for individual and small-scale growers incorporating scientific and crowdsourced information. Moreover, they will develop \u2018campaigns\u2019 (coordinated sampling operations) around local needs and issues, to underpin smarter decision-making and implementation of policy objectives. GROW will actively identify and enable new and credible social and business innovation processes, creating potential new services, applications and markets.

As youth workers, youth leaders and young people, we have to deal with these problems, we have to show examples for young people, give information what happens with them, with their lives if they make a bad decision.  As responsible citizens of their local communities and as citizens of Europe, they are responsible for their health and each other\u2019s safety. Their behavior has an influence on their community, their surrounding, and it starts with their families, friends, schoolmates, neighborhood.

These challenges have been understood mostly in economic terms based on the time-cost-quality triangle. The main approach to tackling these challenges has been to rationalise production processes through standardised work procedures and automated systems, aiming to reduce cost and increase productivity. However, the predominant focus on functionality and efficiency neglects a critical factor for sustainable organisational success: the human being. While worker satisfaction, motivation and empowerment have been recognised as critical for healthy production organisations, these human factors are often viewed at odds with the economic goals of a company.\nThe goal of SO-PC-Pro is to develop methods and tools for holistic design and management of workplaces in production companies, thereby aligning business goals and human needs. It is based on a view of production companies as complex, socio-technical systems of people, processes and machines that flexibly interact.

It is based on the hypothesis that the central issue and starting point of longer term mental illness depends on the individual's capacity and ability to cope with stress.OPTIMI will first identify the occurrence of high stress in the individual on a daily basis. Then it will determine the ongoing effect of stress on the individual by studying the behaviour pattern over a longer period. Finally it will also make estimates of the base line changes in the person's state of mind using symptomatic measurements that closely link depression with cognitive, motor and verbal behaviour. We will use wearable and domestic appliances and identification will be based on noting when stress occurs, at a fine time resolution using ECG and Cortisol, and daily using the Electronic Diary.
