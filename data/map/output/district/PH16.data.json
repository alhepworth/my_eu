ARCH programmes have seen over 1,000 learners from a wide range of government and non-governmental organisations within Scotland visit a variety countries within Europe to learn about the different ways in which new skills and competencies in nature conservation and cultural heritage interpretation can be delivered.  \r\nNature Exchange Two (NET) aims to provide adult learner participants with a focused, ready-made opportunity to take time out from their every-day work to learn about how conservation, education and interpretation work is undertaken elsewhere in Europe and give them an opportunity to consider new ways of working.  \r\nNET  will collaborate with partners throughout Europe from Iceland and Norway in the north to Cyprus and Bulgaria in the south. The aim is to develop knowledge exchange trips (typically of 8-10 days) that focus on the management of our natural and cultural heritage.  NET is developed around the priority areas of work within natural and cultural heritage, conservation interpretation and education in Scotland today.  Each training visit will be associated with a broad theme, which will provide a focus for activities through the week.  Emphasis will be placed on exchange of knowledge, ideas, issues and solutions between the participants and hosts. Informal talks by participants on their work in Scotland and challenges they face, as well as talks from the hosts, encouraging focused discussion on how both participants and hosts can benefit from each other\u2019s knowledge and experiences and how they can  build this into ongoing adult education courses.  \r\nAs in previous years, we will work with our partners to develop adult education training placements, which focus on new skills and knowledge and have the capacity for the exchange of best practice that fits with participants needs. For example in Germany the programme will focus on the wildcat and on preserving and managing its habitat, In Iceland the focus will be interpretive techniques for understanding and conserving the cultural landscape, including the traditional skills of turf building. In Finland and Slovakia the programme theme is forest schools and environmental education.  In Norway the themes are large mammal management, fishery management, predator control and balancing hunting and conservation interests.\r\nOur partners all  share our aim of providing high quality and innovative vocational training.  Receiving partners have been chosen because they are recognised by the UK consortium as being able to provide examples of best practice in the key areas identified as most important for our Scottish practitioners to learn. What they offer has the potential to be built into adult education, both formal and informal. \r\nNET participants will be drawn from the 14 member organisations in the ARCH mobility consortium which includes Scottish Natural Heritage, RSPB, National Trust for Scotland, Forestry Commision Scotland  and John Muir Trust all of whom have a remit to manage and protect Scotland\u2019s natural and cultural heritage through conservation, interpretation and education.  The ARCH consortium will positively encourage those from the more remote areas of Scotland to participate in NET through a publicity and dissemination campaign Our natural and cultural heritage plays a \u201ckey part in promoting a Scottish identity internationally and is a topic appropriate for developing European inter-regional co-operation\u201d  Establishing links and alliances with international organisations and regions and countries are long term strategies where effort needs to be prioritised.\u201d NET addresses this priority.", "http://www.jmt.org", "The Firm of ARCH", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA104-000078_16"]]}}, "5BT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "CHS International 2018", "Scotlands Hotel and leisure club", 117262.0, 12, 25, "CHS, Centrum Humanberuflicher Schulen des Bundes Villach, is a secondary vocational school providing higher education with entrance qualification.

The duration of these internships depends on the students' study focus and varies between four and twelve weeks. Students participating in these internships will leave for their placements between 1 June and 30 September 2018. The businesses hosting these interns are located in the UK, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Germany, Iceland and Spain. They are both long time partners of CHS as well as new contacts thanks to the students' own initiative.\r\n \r\n38 of the students participating in the current CHS project attend the \"H\u00f6here Lehranstalt f\u00fcr wirtschaftliche Berufe\", with a focus on business administration and have a solid education in business, foreign languages, tourism and management.  \r\n\r\nSix participants specializing in fashion design do their four-week internship in a fashion institute in Milan.  Their education at CHS includes development of a fashion collection and computer graphics.\r\n\r\nTwo CHS students attend the \"H\u00f6here Lehranstalt f\u00fcr Kunst\", with a focus on art, do their internship at famous fotographers in Germany. \r\n\r\nOne students attends the \"H\u00f6here Lehranstalt f\u00fcr Kommunikation und Mediendesign\" will support a Finish company at designing websites.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the project, the 47 participating students will develop knowledge, skills and competences that qualify them for the following professions: restaurant management assistant, dressmaker and fine-art photographer/graphic designer, web designer.\r\n\r\nAll professional experiences gained during these internships are assessed, validated and accredited in the exchange the between participants, host businesses and CHS.

The plan is to experiment with STS education models, elaborated to be applied across the EU to achieve the transference to society of the importance of research related to the impact and mitigation of climate change in the seas and oceans. The project has a special focus on the Atlantic Ocean and the comparison with the Baltic Sea and takes advantage of the leadership being adopted by the EU in this area of knowledge. EDUCO2CEAN has the objective of promoting student's interest for knowledge about and study of the oceans, to support their ability to communicate their personal commitment to the challenges of sustainable management of the seas, climate change and reducing the impact of CO2, giving them an active and leading role. These objectives will be sought through the direct involvement of young people in the process of creating and transmitting content. Furthermore, the aim is to transfer this knowledge to general society via non-conventional channels and these students, because of their youth, creativity, formative stage of life, enthusiasm and commitment to a better future, will provide a fresh and involved look at the challenges of conservation and sustainability of the seas, thereby contributing to public awareness raising.Through the involvement of the students in a process which will improve their communication skills, the project aims to transfer to general society idea of the importance of research into the impact, adaptation and mitigation of climate change in the ocean, at the levels of basic, secondary and university education, and generating collaborations and synergies between all stakeholders in the education system.To establish this collaborative network of teachers and students across countries in various regions and at different latitudes on the Atlantic and Baltic Sea which will allow comparison of local impact to find common denominators and differences, EDUCO2CEAN considers that the training of teachers in innovative methodologies is essential as this will allow them to increase their knowledge relating to the cutting-edge science relating to climate change in the oceans and to increase their capacity to develop basic competences in their students through the introduction of this knowledge into the curriculum. It will also provide teachers with complementary materials and support which will help them work on this content with their students in the classroom in a fast, efficient manner.  This strategic group was created with the objective of supporting this methodology and to gradually keep adding members among educational communities that will allow them to face new challenges and develop more products which will help increase the students\u2019 awareness and their commitment to transmit their message and knowledge to society, becoming ambassadors of sustainability and the reduction of the CO2 footprint in the oceans.", "http://www.masts.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PT01-KA201-022952_5"]]}}, "5ET": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Language training", "Pitlochry High School", 2985.0, 1, 1, "Currently, Pitlochry High School teaches one Modern Language: French.

This would allow us to develop as both a Primary and a Secondary school, and meet the expectations of the Scottish Governments 1+2 initiative, which is to be fully implemented by 2020. The training course selected would allow a member of Pitlochry's Modern Languages department to be sent on a 3-week course run by LFEE, which would complement the learning of Spanish that the staff member in question has already undertaken through a local University. The goal would be to ensure the embedding of Spanish within Pitlochry High School through training in language and methodology. This could then not only be provided in Pitlochry High School but cascaded downwards to feeder primary schools, and interested schools in our local cluster. As the member of staff in question is already a Secondary teacher trained as a Primary Language Leader, this would allow primary schools to develop Spanish into their curriculum if they wished through training of staff.Pitlochry High School could also be further integrated with Europe, through use of the e-twinning programme to find partner schools abroad for the purposes of a language exchange.If Spanish can be successfully integrated within the school now, within a few years we will have children leaving Pitlochry High School with a high standard of spoken Modern Languages, able to converse in both French and Spanish.
