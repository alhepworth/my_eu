Additionally, the range of basic skills for life and competence-development for learners from disadvantaged backgrounds remain without validation, constituting an impediment for learners to upskill themselves, and for AEPs to link informal learning with formal education and employment pathways. In this respect, TaMPADA develops a toolkit for impact assessment geared towards measuring learners\u2019 \u2018lifelong\u2019 and \u2018lifewide\u2019 progress, building upon the results of the preceding IMPADA project. Taking into account that socially disadvantaged groups are hard-to-reach, the TaMPADA project develops an outreach framework based on ICT, web-based solutions and community synergies with intermediary organisations.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nTaMPADA particularly aims to: \r\na) Develop an ICT- and community-based outreach framework and monitoring toolkit for AEPs to enhance learner-centred approaches to quality assurance.\r\nb) Anchor this framework to both evolving and emerging quality assurance practices in adult education in the EU.\r\nc) Yield benefits for public authorities and AEPs from the exchange of good practices, and the promotion & harmonization of tracking and monitoring procedures.\r\n\r\nTHE TaMPADA PARTNERSHIP\r\nThe partnership comprises 5 partners with complementary skills and long experience and expertise on adult education. AEPs, networks of AEPs and experts on research & development methodologies form a partnership with a view to addressing the challenges related to learner-centred impact monitoring for disadvantaged learners. DACES, AZM and Folkuniversitetet have a long-standing engagement with marginalised and socially disadvantaged learners, and play a key role in their respective adult education landscapes since they represent networks of learning centres that extend regionally and nationally (DACES, Folkuniversitetet). LLLP leverages the communication of the TaMPADA framework EU-wide and ensures maximum dissemination and impact across adult education networks, policy-making and implementation circles.

The lack of systematic evaluation & impact monitoring aiming at disadvantaged adult learners results in insufficient data, preventing adult learning providers from taking informed decisions and designing practices to improve effectiveness on disadvantaged groups. Adult learning providers need methodologies, tools and guidance to engage in a self-review process and adopt a systematic monitoring system to generate sufficient evidence to understand and evaluate their effectiveness on disadvantaged learners.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n1. Identify the most important factors that affect effectiveness of adult learning providers on EU disadvantaged adult learners.\r\n2. Develop & provide adult learning providers with a validated framework and a self-assessment methodology on effectiveness towards disadvantaged, to engage them in a self-review process and improve the existing monitoring techniques.\r\n3. Produce open resources and recommendations for practices and policies to enable adult learning providers to improve effectiveness of adult education provision for disadvantaged.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPADA PARTNERSHIP\r\nThe partnership comprises 5 organisations from 5 EU countries from the worlds of adult learning provision, educational research & policy development. Derbyshire Adult Community Education Service (DACES) is a large UK provider experienced in applying evaluation methods on education effectiveness. The Polish Educational Research Institute (IBE) leads the research on the evaluation of education systems.

Desk research and focus groups to identify the factors influencing adult education effectiveness on disadvantaged.\r\n2. Development of a common framework, implementation guide and self-assessment methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of adult learning providers on disadvantaged learners.\r\n3. Exchange of successful practices to produce recommendations for improvements on the effectiveness of adult education provision for disadvantaged.\r\n4. Training of the partnership\u2019s adult learning providers on the use of the IMPADA framework and tools and on the design of improvement measures.\r\n5. Self-assessment of providers to pilot test the IMPADA framework and tools and to produce improvement plans.\r\n6. Creation of a network of IMPADA adopters to facilitate the sustainability of results.\r\n7. Promotion of IMPADA outputs through multiplier events.\r\n\r\nRESULTS & IMPACT\r\n1. Criteria for measuring adult education effectiveness on disadvantaged groups to provide trainers and managing staff of adult leaning providers with greater understanding on disadvantaged learners\u2019 needs and help them design & deliver more attractive & efficient education programmes (6500 managers and trainers to be reached).\r\n2. A framework and tools for the evaluation of the effectiveness of adult learning providers towards disadvantaged to a) engage adult learning providers in a self-review process to evaluate the effectiveness of their provision on disadvantaged, and b) help National bodies enhance existing (where applicable) evaluation frameworks (500 providers, 60 key individuals in national authorities and educational research institutes to be reached).\r\n3. Recommendations for adult learning providers to help them improve their effectiveness, adapting education provision to the needs of specific disadvantaged groups.\r\n4. A network of IMPADA adopters and repository of assessment results to allow the exchange of practices regarding disadvantaged learners and promote the adoption of IMPADA outputs (60 adopters during project life).\r\n5.

Today, the stigmas of wars are still present.\r\nAs the capital of the Somme department and committed to the organization of the centenary of the Great War, Amiens offers to the young people suitable infrastructures to carry out the project.

Indeed, the program will be co-constructed with young people, who will make a preparatory work upstream to the meeting. This work will allow us to direct and to define the content of the various activities.

Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) -also known as Free Form Fabrication and formerly Rapid Manufacturing-, is a novel fabrication method of parts directly from the electronic model by layer manufacturing, using active principles such as laser and Electron beams. Currently, ALM is the first and the best option for short series of customized products. However, layered manufacturing is not without challenges. Part properties, dimensional accuracy and surface quality depend strongly on process planning, and sometimes prevent ALM parts to be considered as fully functional. The objective of KARMA is to respond to above mentioned challenges with a knowledge-based engineering system (KBE) that can estimate functional properties of ALM parts automatically and in short time. The KBE system would define the optimal production parameters automatically and execute a virtual test of the fabricated part.
