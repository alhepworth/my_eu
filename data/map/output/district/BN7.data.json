As some older models of interaction no longer work, museum staff need to step outside their comfort zone and seek innovative ways to collaborate with their communities.\r\nThis project proposal is an outcome raised as a result of the Creative Museum project that was created in response to the need to provide training for museum professionals and their partners to accommodate a perceived shift in the dynamic of museum engagement programmes, where museums find themselves working collaboratively outside the sector, creating a new language of participation and engagement. \r\nThe Making Museum project will build on the established success of The Creative Museum project in several ways. Firstly, the Making Museum project will extend and further develop the training opportunities previously offered under The Creative Museum project. Both of these training programmes - the Maker-in-Residence and the Museomix Training programme will be underpinned by a training framework tested during the first project which is sustainable and robust.

For example, in 2016 the overall annual market for Lane Departure Warning systems is expected to reach 22 million units/year (corresponding to 14,3 billion dollars). This market growth will be possible only through the reduction of costs of components as well as the seamless integration of different functions in the same architecture. Since the market will include also low volume vehicles, there will be also a strong need to reduce development costs. Electric vehicles will be an additional catalyst for the ADAS market. The absence of engine noise requires the introduction of new means to protect vulnerable road users from these vehicles. On the other hand, electric vehicles can easily support (semi)automatic functions (such as parking manoeuvres and Stop&Go).\nTo manage the expected increase of function complexity together with the required reduction of costs (fixed and variable) DESERVE will design and build an ARTEMIS Tool Platform based on the standardisation of the interfaces, software (SW) reuse, development of common non-competitive SW modules,  and easy and safety-compliant integration of  standardised hardware (HW) or SW from different suppliers. With innovative design space exploration (DSE) methods system design costs can be reduced by more than 15%.\nHence, DESERVE will build an innovation ecosystem for European leadership in ADAS embedded systems, based on the automotive R&D actors, with possible applications in other industrial domains.\nSince the purpose of ADAS functions is also to support the driver, an advanced human-centred design strategy will be integrated in the Tool Platform. Therefore, the developed applications will provide natural and friendly  support to the driver, with proper levels of overall functional safety also during complex or emergency manoeuvres.\n-\n-\n-\nVersion approved by the JU on 14/07/2015", 82768.0, 19372210.0, 9, 26, "DESERVE", null, "http://www.asl-vision.co.uk", null, "fp7_104880_983072206"], [1364774400000, 1475193600000, "COgnitive & Perceptive CAMeraS", "Application Solutions (Electronics and Vision) Ltd", "Vision systems are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives.

The project significantly increased our capacity in important ways that we want to build on.\r\n\r\nBased on the gains from the previous project we see: A shift in the culture of our organisation in terms of incorporating more experiential and participatory learning methodologies; development in terms of the inclusivity and diversity dimension of our work; strengthened connections with other like-minded organisations able to work together to reach our respective aims.\r\n\r\nWe aim to consolidate and build on these gains, especially our effectiveness in working to support some specific demographic groups who suffer disenfranchisement, disadvantage and vulnerability. Specifically, this includes: LGBT communities, disabled people \u2013 especially those who are hearing impaired, homeless people and those enduring precarious housing.\r\n\r\nWe want to increase our capacity to support diverse and disadvantaged learners; build on burgeoning shifts in quality, methodology and language for training approaches; increase our trainers' ability to secure paid employment. \r\n\r\nWe also seek to expand our work at a European level, forge stronger European connections for the sharing of best practices and strengthening sectoral capacity in terms of informal adult education, including the spread of entrepreneurial approaches.\r\n\r\nWe will send 15 of our trainers on courses and five of our team will be involved in carrying out teaching assignments.

Intercompany Training Centre as one of the units of School Centre Nova Gorica in which LLP and Erasmus+ projects are coordinated is working with several organizations in Slovenia such as Institute of the Republic of Slovenia for Vocational Education and Training, The National Education Institute of The Republic of Slovenia, Ministry of Education and Sport and other foreign organizations.\r\nOver the years we have learned the best way is to work with educational organizations which help us to find on-the-job-learning work place in their workshops, companies, at craftsmen and in other companies. We are increasingly work on principle of reciprocity, which means we host foreign students from partner\u2019s organizations every year. Effect of good partnerships is that our students can gain qualitative knowledge. Anyway we will try to collaborate with two intermediate agencies too. Within implementation of the project we want to improve skills of professional flexibility for students and staff, on the other hand to increase internationalization process at the School center Nova Gorica.", "http://www.plumpton.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SI01-KA102-012355_10"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "Plumpton College", 15311.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.plumpton.ac.uk", "Plumpton College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-036022_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "Plumpton College", 8948.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.plumpton.ac.uk", "Plumpton College", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-024014_coordinator"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "Plumpton College", 8273.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.plumpton.ac.uk", "Plumpton College", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047421_coordinator"], [2015, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "Plumpton College", 2116.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.plumpton.ac.uk", "Plumpton College", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012745_coordinator"]]}}}}
