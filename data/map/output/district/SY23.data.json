The objective of our project is to increase the physical activity of our pupils and their physical literacy skills.  This will be done through developing, refining and sharing methodology and resources to achieve an 'active learning' approach to teaching across all areas of the curriculum.   \r\n\r\nParticipant schools have identified a need  to challenge increased screen time, obesity and disparity between the motivation and attainments of different groups in school.  Pupils with alternative home languages, educational, social or economic obstacles account for a large number of pupils in our schools, so we welcome the prospect of  developing our skills and pedagogy to meet their needs and provide a more inclusive education.  We all share a goal in the desire to foster active, engaged individuals whom are equipped with the basic skills  and enthusiasm for learning in order to succeed in the rest of their lives. \r\n\r\nMany studies, e.g.  https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/health_and_academics/pdf/pa-pe_paper.pdf, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16363467, have proven the link between physical activity and attainment levels, so we anticipate that as a result of increasing physical activity in our schools, attainment in literacy, numeracy, science and skills in language learning will improve.  ICT will be used by staff and pupils as a tool for producing outcomes and sharing our ideas and results so we expect that this will have positive impact upon developing ICT skills also.\r\n\r\nA major part of our our project will be sharing the good practice already in evidence in our individual schools through Learning and Training Events hosted by each participant school.  Host schools will invite local or national experts to run workshops and school staff will lead training or demonstrate good practice to be observed.   Each country will run training related to their individual specialties: Wales - active learning in the Foundation Phase and 'SKIP', integrating the development of physical literacy skills in cross curricular teaching activites; Finland - principles of the scheme 'Finnish Schools on the Move' and how to create active daily programmes; Germany: developing ICT skills in the outdoor area and learning in the forest; Spain - language learning through active means; Sweden - Using the outdoor and local area to develop skills across the curriculum.  We will also work collaboratively to share our work on schemes like Forest Schools, Eco Schools, Bronze Ambassadors and SUSTRANS.   Approximately 1,700 pupils will be involved directly in our project, 60 different members of staff will attend the Learning and Training Events, and at least 4,000 stakeholders or members of the community will be impacted through our planned activities and events.\r\n\r\n'Run, Jump, Learn' will be organised into three themes:  Year 1-active learning in the classroom; Year 2-active learning in the school grounds; Year 3-active learning in the local area.  Activities working towards the objective by enabling active learning will be carried out by pupils and staff between Learning and Training Events and results like videos, photos, statistics and resource packs will be uploaded onto a blog.  Results will also be shared on eTwinning and Twitter.  Pupils will produce films and leaflets showcasing how to be active in their local area.  They will compare data on traveling to school and school sports events.  They will communicate in different languages through different digital means and share their experiences of active learning with each other.  Staff will work collaboratively to produce activity packs for parents, films of lessons or activities demonstrating good practice in active learning, activity cards and resources.\r\n\r\nSuccess towards achieving our project objective will be measured through regular questionnaires and interviews.  It will be collated, assessed and monitored throughout the project.\r\n\r\nThe impact of our cooperation will have long lasting effect upon practice in our schools as together we will share and develop approaches and practices that will be embedded in school routines and ethos, enhancing the capacity for the provision and quality of health and wellbeing in our schools, long after the current pupils and staff have moved on.\r\n\r\nAs a result of our project we expect staff to gain the necessary skills and utilise them in providing active learning across the curriculum to ensure that pupils lead a more active school life.

The increased efficiency of N use in dairy production is proposed as key action to reduce N contamination, and mathematical models provide a powerful tool to help with this. We are planning to use two models: The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS; a cow based model) and the Lifetime Nitrogen Efficiency (LNE; a herd based model). The models will be updated on amino acid metabolism (CNCPS), heifer growth and cattle fertility and economics (LNE) increasing not only their accuracy but also their commercial potential. In parallel, an intensive outreach program will incorporate farms in each country to describe N balance situation. This step will provide the necessary time to familiarize and accommodate farms with current model use. The last phase of the project consists on the implementation of the upgraded models in our pilot farms. This will provide a real life example that can generate a shift in agricultural practice towards more efficient and less polluting dairy industry. The European Union has been taken several initiatives either at a research level (e.g. FP-7 project RedNex) or at a legislative level (e.g. the National Emission Ceilings directive 2001/81/EC; currently under revision) to reduce N pollution from dairy production.

As a follow-up from my previous research in European security and preliminary results from studying assistance to border reform, it aims to both aid the EU\u2019s efforts to establish a more efficient European Border and Coast Guard and foster greater humanitarian and democratic sensibilities in European border policy. In contrast to existing approaches which neglect reflective practice of actors on the ground, the project explores new empirical evidence, hones new theoretical avenues and develops participative dissemination techniques to nurture reflexivity in cooperation between scholars and practitioners. In order to do so, it studies the lived experience of Polish Border Guard (PBG) officers involved in the transformation of their service in the aftermath of EU enlargement which occurred at the intersection of receiving training from Western European border guards and providing training assistance to the Ukrainian Border Guard service. This unique situation of dual interaction triggers reflection and creates conditions for knowledge production that the project taps into.

The system will contain a disposable bioreactor bag with unique miniaturized disposable sensors. The DO and pH sensors use optical chemical methods capable of high frequency sampling, this ensures an enhanced stability of the expansion process. Using an expandable bioreactor the volume can be increased during cell culture, without the need for passaging of the cells. Because of this feature the system can be truly closed, without the limitations of a fixed culture substrate area. Leiden University Medical Center (NL) will validate the system and the products in a clinical setting by comparing bioreactor-expanded MSCs with GMP grade MSCs produced by established protocols in the LUMC. Successful development of this bioreactor system will be beneficial for the participating SMEs as well as the medical sector which will be able to develop cell therapies in a faster, cheaper and more efficient way. Collectively, the partners in REACH will develop an exploitation and business plan for the successful valorization of the research done in the FP7 StemExpand project.", 373760.0, 5306060.0, 3, 4, "REACH", null, "http://www.aber-instruments.co.uk", null, "fp7_108812_951697459"]]}}, "3BU": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "NATIONAL LIBRARY OF WALES ROYAL CHARTER*LLYFRGELL GENEDLAETHOL CYMRU", 74492.0, "Promoting interoperability, sustainable deployment, operation and upgrading of trans-European digital service infrastructures, as well as coordination at European level (09.03.03)", "fts_2017_21547"]]}}, "3EE": {"esif": {"data": [[1418342400000, 1698710400000, "Aberystwyth Innovation and Enterprise Campus (AIEC)", "Aberystwyth Innovation and Enterprise Campus Ltd", "Construction of a new state-of-the-art, internationally recognised facility to attract further research funding so that companies and researchers can undertake collaborative research projects to boost the bio-economy, with a focus on sustainable food, health, biotechnology and renewable energy.", "ERDF", 20000000.0, 30596231.0, "erdf_wales_80741"]]}}, "3FB": {"nweurope": {"data": [["Aberystwyth University", "RE-DIRECT - REgional Development and Integration of unused biomass wastes as REsources for Circular products and economic Transformation", "RE-DIRECT is a holistic approach to promote the efficient use of natural resources and materials by converting residual biomass into carbon products and activated carbon at smart regional decentralised units.
