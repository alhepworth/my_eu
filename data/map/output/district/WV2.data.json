It has a clear focus on the development, evaluation and dissemination of innovative classroom approaches for children from birth to 7 years old and the educators who work with them. \r\n \r\nThe project title is; Making the parts \u2018whole\u2019 - developing observation and assessment in transdisciplinary classrooms. This focus arises from the pedagogical approach of all of the schools involved and is an evolution of ongoing school improvement research between some of the schools.  \r\n\r\nWe will develop, test and evaluate school environments that not only recognise and promote cross-curricular learning, but also define conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and translational innovations that integrate and move beyond discipline-specific approaches to curriculum. The objective includes a focus on creating, observing and assessing how transdisciplinary environments can be developed to promote young children's pro-social and self regulation behaviours, essential to being an effective learner in school and how they promote inclusion by changing classroom culture to recognise and value diversity as enhancing education for everyone.\r\n \r\nThe objectives for all schools are:\r\n1) To develop innovative classroom environments for children that support transdisciplinary pedagogies.\r\n2) To create descriptions and analysis of how children learn in transdisciplinary classrooms that show the creativity generated through interactions between concepts and curriculum areas.\r\n3) To create new observation and assessment materials that support transdisciplinary classrooms and which are relevant for children in the pre-primary and primary phases and in different national contexts.\r\n4) To increase the development of pro-social skills and self-regulation in children through transdisciplinary classrooms.\r\n5) To increase the inclusion of children from vulnerable groups by revealing the strategies that all children use to express ideas and make meaning in their learning through reports, case studies and pedagogical documentation arising from the project.\r\n6) To develop the knowledge, skills and confidence of educators to describe, understand and communicate children's learning and adults teaching in the transdisciplinary environment.\r\n7) To include the participation of parents in their children's early education during the project.\r\n \r\nThis project will be built around transnational training / study weeks in other schools in other cultural, social and historical contexts. Through previous project work we have found this to be a dynamic strategy for change, both with the practitioners visiting other schools and for those receiving visitors. \r\n \r\nThis professional exchange is more powerful in a transnational context for three main reasons; as our observations are less focused on the singular, dominant language, we will be observing the holistic communication of children and not relying so heavily on their verbal skills. Also we focus on the relationships of teaching and learning and are less likely to feel restrained or hindered by preconceptions of limitations imposed by local or national curriculum frameworks and educational regulations. Lastly, the active presence of educators from other countries within a school also has many benefits for promoting positive cultural relations with parents, families and the wider community of the school, supporting the development of participation, tolerance, value and understanding in the wider community of a school.\r\n\r\nIn the framework of the Erasmus+ project, we are going to develop our project based in formal and informal education methodologies. We\u2019ll start with an introduction of the new transdiscplinary methodology and also with a theoretical approach based on the work of Gregory Bateson that challenges us to see the connections, relations and intra-actions in our methods of teaching and children's learning arising from Loris Malaguzzi's proposition of a Hundred Languages of Children.\r\n\r\nAt a local and regional level the desired impact will be:\r\n- Increased awareness of how children learn.\r\n- increased confidence to promote and engage in classroom innovation.\r\n- increased use of innovative methods of observation, evaluation and assessment that result in rich, engaging classroom environments and curricular opportunities for children.\r\n- increased commitment, confidence and actions to promote inclusion and equality.\r\n\r\nAt a national and European level the desired impact will be:\r\n- used in learning from the project through pedagogical documentation and case studies and open access observations and assessment tools that will be shared through professional networks through organisations involved in the inspiration of working with Reggio Emilia values and principles and other early years organisations such as Early Education, Sightlines Initiative, BEECERA The Reggio Emilia Institute, Stockholm and Modern Childhood magazine.", "http://www.phoenixnrseryschool.co.uk", "Madeley Nursery School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036796_6"], [2015, "'We Think Everywhere' - New Pedagogies - Embracing the Digital World of Children", "Phoenix Nursery school", 80288.0, 2, 9, "This project will investigate and develop innovative pedagogical methods in which digital media is used to generate thinking, knowledge and learning in very young children. Initial research revealed a dominant discourse where digital media was conceived as a set of tools to acquire and represent information; or as a place to use games to practice skills.\r\nWe challenge this view and will develop teaching methods and learning strategies that use digital media as part of a multi-disciplinary approach involving communication, mathematics and science, humanities, social and civic competence, cultural awareness and creative expression supported, enriched and made visible to others using digital media. It will become part of the everyday life of Pre-School.\r\nThis project is part of a professional development alliance that started in 2011. The alliance is a network of 5 schools in the UK and 5 in Sweden who are developing curriculum using interdisciplinary projects with young children from 1 to 6 years old.\r\nOur core objectives are to develop new teaching methods:\r\n\u2022 developing environments in which digital media can be used alongside other materials and resources within flexible and inter-disciplinary approaches\r\n\u2022 that show how teachers can offer digital media to young children that promotes independence and creative outcomes\r\n\u2022 that can be readily shared across national contexts and used by educators in ECE and beyond into primary phases of school \r\n\u2022 that will be relevant when used with future digital \r\nThere are 10 school leaders of pedagogy, school administration and systems management, 20 teachers working in classrooms with children aged 1-6 yrs and 150 children and their families working directly in project.\r\nOur method is to agree a meta-project that has relevance for all children and exchange our observations of the children\u2019s learning and our reflections on the adults teaching, done though digital exchanges online (through the use of secure shared folders, blogs and social messaging).  These will be enhanced through face to face meetings and through transnational exchange and evaluated against DIGCOMP: A Framework for Developing and Understanding Digital Competence in Europe. \r\nOur outputs include a range of inspiring and informative on-line and hard copy resources in 2 written and spoken languages. \r\nThe project will challenge traditional ideals and ways of seeing learning referencing Delueze and Guttarri\u2019s Rhizome Theory, Bateson\u2019s The Pattern that Connects and Reggio Emilia\u2019s concept of 100 Languages.  These conceptual frameworks have influenced the development of pedagogy in each of the partner schools in both countries. \r\nThe project is conceived as a series of case studies which will draw upon semi-structured focus groups (identified shared network days and leadership meetings), personal reflective journals of each teacher, the documentation of process and shared analysis of pedagogical documentation produced within and as an outcome of the project.\r\nThe structure of the project invites international confrontation of multiple perspectives upon episodes of children\u2019s meaning-making in group contexts using digital media as a tool of creative expression and enquiry.  This shared analysis will identify the patterns of development in children and pedagogical practice that can be articulated and shared through the website, publishing, video and training materials and replicated in other ECE contexts and beyond into Primary phase.\r\nDuring the project we will be developing new pedagogies that exploit the potential of ICT which is a key issue addressed in the Communication on Rethinking Education (in particular, chapter 2.2), and the enhancement of digital competence which is one of the main pillars of the Digital Agenda for Europe [71], and also one of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives. \r\nWithin the participating schools digital resources of all types will be used during lessons by children to support learning as digital media to be a part of the everyday life of preschool as an expressive language to facilitate and support enquiry. \r\nTeachers will have increased complexity of understanding and increased confidence in using digital technologies in meaningful, necessary ways that support children\u2019s learning and communication and be able to train and mentor others within and beyond the participating school at a local, regional, national and international level. The new methods will be transferrable for use with different digital platforms and digital hardware. It will have relevance to a wide audience that can be readily shared across national contexts and used by educators in ECE and beyond into primary phases of school.

ACTO is committed to ensuring the attainment of the 8 transversal skills defined by Europe, needed by  young people in the tourism and culture sector to sustain a job. Training on entrepreneurial skills and employability skills with work-based training will make young people more employable in Italy and Europe.The project also aims to make the participants more modern, innovative, flexible and attractive to the labor market. This formal, non-formal and work based training, triggers positive changes in terms of self-esteem, language skills, flexibility and organizational skills.The project tackles the reduction of  young people being unemployment and gives the participants entrepreneurial skills increasingly required by the labour market and to obtain a qualified job and the understanding of continuous learning.This project will improve, strengthen and expand the skills and competences acquired in theory, with a work-placement of 22 days in a company in England or Spain. Whiles being abroad on a mobility they  will improve their language skills and understand new ways to make them more flexible, open-minded and open towards innovation and modernisation. The training will start in Italy, with a preparatory stage where the participant obtains competences on how to present yourself in an interview, some coaching on addressing difficult situations and some communication techniques to better deal with their experience abroad. Also, a Personal Development Plan (Individual development plan -IDP) will be created that identifies the aspirations and objectives of the participants including an action plan to achieve them.
