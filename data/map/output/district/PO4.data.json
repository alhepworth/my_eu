For this reason the project stems from the activities already designed and developed by some Consortium members last year. The involved bodies and institutions belong to a geographical area called Bioregion of Alpi Apuane; this region is situated between the Serchio basin and the lower valley of the Magra river, around Alpi Apuane. The economic and geographic characteristics are the same in all the territory. It is an area supplied with interesting features: its natural landscapes  (e.g. the mountains overlooking the sea), its wide range of 20 DOP and IGP products, that is the highest at a national level,  its strategic position close to the best artistic towns of  Tuscany, reachable in less than an hour. Despite this, tourism is not so diffuse and the main kind of tourism activity is related to the sea and the beaches, while the number of farm stays is the lowest of Tuscany. Obviously, the territory needs to be adequately protected but it is also necessary an important action to promote and enhance it. However, this area presents different problems and weaknesses connected to the environment: the unsustainable development, based on a bad extraction of the marble, the abandonment of outlying areas, although their great historical interest, the climatic changes and the particular morphology that amplifies the effects of atmospheric agents (e.g. floods).\r\nStarting from this context, the project is addressed to 90 students of 6 High Schools related to the agricultural and tourist sector, located in the Bioregion of Alpi Apuane (15 participants per school). Participants must be enrolled in the last year of school or graduated within 12 months after graduation.\r\nThe project aims to transfer the right skills to improve and protect the environment, providing a good option to the current development model. This result could be achieved with the context and experience analysis of those European countries that managed to exploit, protect and promote their resources. \r\nThe traineeship will last three weeks and will be developed into innovative and dynamic companies of the following sectors: tourism, agriculture, agritourism and agribusiness.\r\nParticipants attended the agrarian school will:\r\n> develop skills about the planning action and land management practices, through the adaptation of the crops production and their use in respect of the climatic changes (resilience);\r\n> carry out actions concerning the land protection.\r\nParticipants attended  the tourist school will:\r\n> set up promotional actions and a tourist enhancement strategy of the available products and services;\r\n> plan tourist packages for a defined target customer, in order to foster this area through the use of  ICT and social media.\r\nParticipants activities are divided into the following steps:\r\n- project advertising for candidates recruitment. \r\n- Participants selection: it will be realized at each Consortium High School.\r\n- Training preparation: it will last 51 hours divided into seminars with a teacher (15 h) and e-learning (36 h). It will be organized at each school analysing different topics: the foreign languages (English or Spanish eLearning course), the hosting countries culture (orientation), technical aspects referring to the tourist or agricultural sector, workers'safety, self-entrepreneurship. An individual plan will be prepared for each participant, on the basis of their professional paths and not forgetting their entry level competences and the defined learning outcomes. Skills and knowledges are relative to the Regione Toscana directory, in particular to the ADA 377 \"Design, definition and promotion of tourist development plans\" or to the ADA1492 \"Analysis and monitoring of production and development\". During the meeting the staff will give participants information about the administration and the  management of the project phases.\r\n- Mobility: before the departure each participant will receive the tickets and the handbook; then they will develop a three weeks traineeship in UK, Spain, Ireland, Germany. The hosting partner will support participants during their stay, dealing with their reception, matching, monitoring and assessment. The consortium will perform monitoring actions contacting participants, partners and host organizations, by phone, skype, whatsapps and social media.\r\nAt the end of this experience the hosting organizations will give participants the Europass mobility and the ECVET certificate of the acquired skills.\r\n- Post mobility: at the mobility end participants will return the administrative documentation and will complete the final report.

The participation of entrepreneurs in defining and planning of training promotes the desired continuous modernization of the offered profiles. Businesses often complain of young people, their lack of flexibility and adaptability, entrepreneurship and personal autonomy. The project EN.PASS therefore assumes great importance since it allows beneficiaries to a direct comparison with situations linguistically, culturally and technologically different from their local context stimulating their curiosity and self-study, in an international dimension. The opportunity to experience completely new experiences even in terms of personal commitment, is a unique opportunity for the 150 students: it will substantially affect on their future professional life, given their location in an area (particulary VENETO-FVG-SICILIA Region), subject to strong pressures for change and in need of new ideas and initiatives which are geared to sustainable development model.

The preparation will be completed abroad, where, during the first week, the participants will be given a language and cultural training, together with introductory lectures to the internship, which will consist in 4 weeks full-time work placements in different companies according to their professional profile.The project  is set in a geographical context which is called the Bassa Padovana area, in the South part of the Venetian region, which is characterized by an economy that is continuously suffering from the shortage of job occupation due to the financial and economic crisis. What is more, really radical historical and cultural conditionings and the permanence of genre and ethnic stereotypes make difficult to change behaviours and organization models of small enterprises and limit the necessary innovation processes.In this context, the project  offered the young people important formative opportunities by means of the mobility activities that helped  them to improve the relationships with the other, either at genre or culture of origin levels, to perceive  the difference as a resource , not only as a limit.

These competences concern some soft skills such as ability to have an open vision towards society, relational skills, self-entrepreneurship, flexibility personal organisation as well as specific technical skills.  The professional profiles involved are related to Tourism and other linked sectors: services (marketing and administration, information technology, restaurants and hotel accommodation), agri-food and environment management.The common goals to the different professional profiles are aimed at the acquisition or enhancement of the following skills:1-To interact by using Foreign languages 2- To positively face new cultural contexts, 3- To adapt to unfamiliar situations, to be flexible, mindful and interested towards new experiences and to live them as a learning opportunity 4-To practise personal autonomy by means of daily training of self-organization and of stress management5- To build-up constructive relationships and to take charge of responsibilities at work  6- To acquire or develop some professional skills The mobility is integrated in the sending school curriculum and it is recognised as equivalent to the school-work Alternance (work based learning); therefore, the application of ECVET procedures in organizing and implementing the work experience abroad will enable the recognition of credits.
