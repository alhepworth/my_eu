By generating a synergy between education, research, innovation and social inclusion, marginalised students will be recruited onto modernised BA and MA pathways. Through collaborating with students as co-researchers, the project generates opportunities to participate, enhances employability and supports academic progression. By re-designing curricula to include marginalised students transnationally, HEI partners will actively promote \u2018social cohesion, sustainable development, active citizenship and personal fulfilment in European societies\u2019.\r\n\r\nEU efforts to reduce social inequality must focus on marginalised contexts where we learn from those who live with the consequences. Historically, HEI\u2019s have reproduced economic disparities and compounded social immobility. HEI innovation and modernisation is crucial for preventing social exclusion. This project enhances social mobility by developing new approaches to student/educator co-creation. This will be achieved by collaborating with marginalised students to reduce inequality and disrupt intergenerational cycles of educational dis-investment.\r\n\r\nThis project targets disadvantaged students with experience of Early School Leaving (ESL)/Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET). Through recruiting students as co-researchers, the project seeks to minimise the risk of educational failure and improve HEI retention rates. By embedding ESL/NEET experience at the heart of the project, a transnational and empirically informed evidence base will develop \u2018deprivation literacy\u2019 models. \u2018Deprivation Literacy\u2019 models will help improve relationships between ESL/NEET, Associate Partners and key stakeholders across education, training and welfare provisions. \r\n \r\nThis project has been designed to intervene and compensate for social exclusion. By valuing the knowledge and insights of student co-researchers, advanced research and practice experience will be acquired. In short, this project models social inclusion within our own HEI\u2019s and local communities. Initially, each HEI will recruit a minimum of 5 student co-researchers. A minimum of 30 current ESL/NEET will also be recruited onto the project as informants. Informants will be identified by liaising with key stakeholders/ Associate Partners within deprived regions identified in Norway, Denmark and the Northwest of England. \r\n\r\nBuilding upon the success of an ongoing longitudinal study of ESL/NEET undertaken by USN, this project will utilise an informal \u2018indirect approach\u2019 methodology. Following training in this approach educators and students will collect qualitative data designed to capture informants unstructured biographies. The methodology places a specific emphasis on connecting with and investing in marginalised young people. Through analysing the connections disadvantaged informants develop with co-researchers, theories of \u2018deprivation literacy\u2019 conceived at UoC will contribute to the theoretical foundations of the methodology. \r\n\r\nThe project will co-design a transnational online Research Module. All educators and students will be trained in the \u2018indirect\u2019 method and will also receive preliminary \u2018deprivation literacy\u2019 training for working with vulnerable populations. Academic content and assessment will be constructively aligned to produce \u2018authentic assessments\u2019 for student co-researchers who prefer to \u2018learn by doing\u2019.

On a national scale, it will provide the wherewithal to test a new form of mobility during students' initial training that could prove transposable to other ESPEs. On the European scale, it will help to boost pan-European education. Inasmuch as the beneficiaries are teachers starting out on their careers, the project will have a significant multiplier effect. By financing an international training placement for a student, there could potentially be over 1200 pupils (for a primary education teacher) and over 4,000 pupils (for secondary education) likely to benefit from greater European openness.", "http://www.cumbria.ac.uk ", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036972_3"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF CUMBRIA", 15141.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cumbria.ac.uk ", "UNIVERSITY OF CUMBRIA", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047420_coordinator"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF CUMBRIA", 7728.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cumbria.ac.uk ", "UNIVERSITY OF CUMBRIA", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035663_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF CUMBRIA", 6088.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cumbria.ac.uk ", "UNIVERSITY OF CUMBRIA", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023528_coordinator"], [2014, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF CUMBRIA", 2172.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cumbria.ac.uk ", "UNIVERSITY OF CUMBRIA", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000117_coordinator"], [2015, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF CUMBRIA", 1431.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cumbria.ac.uk ", "UNIVERSITY OF CUMBRIA", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012619_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"data": [[1473033600000, 1607299200000, "Eco-Innovation Cumbria", "University of Cumbria", "Supporting SME's through knowledge exchange to develop low carbon prodcts and technhology", "ERDF", 1296719.0, 2161199.0, "erdf_england_391"]]}}, "2TL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1483228800000, 1577750400000, "Nano-Enabled Conducting Materials Accelerating Device Applicability", "Crown Packaging Manufacturing Uk Limited", "The project targets the incorporation of advanced functional materials to deliver customised conductive inks and flexible adhesives compatible with high volume manufacturing platforms.
