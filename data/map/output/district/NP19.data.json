It is a global business and global labour market. There is fierce competition, not only domestically, but internationally as well. In England in 2013-14 the top eight Premier League clubs made 44 new signings and 33 of these players were foreign. Staggeringly in 2013-14 just five English players took part in all 38 Premier League matches. Currently, 93% of players at English academies are British but less than 25% of new players signed by Premier League clubs in 2013-14 were UK nationals. Clearly, our academy players are not making the transition to first team status as efficiently as our European competitors, which supports the Welsh FA\u2019s desire to study European coaching practice. \r\n\r\nThe Welsh FA\u2019s previous participation in the Leonardo da Vinci mobility programme has demonstrated the undoubted potential for mobility to enhance the employment prospects for young apprentices (VET learners). Between 15-20% of all mobility participants went on to achieve first team status, which is an unprecedented success rate and directly attributable to the benefits of mobility. By contrast, in the absence of mobility, only 5-8% of apprentices can expect to achieve first team promotion.  One of the great value-added benefits of mobility participation is the finding that apprentices who are unsuccessful in being offered a professional contract are still four times more likely to be offered employment in a secondary career pathway than those who have not undertaken mobility. \r\n\r\nMobility will allow 65 male and female elite players to experience the training methods at three UEFA-acknowledged centres of excellence in Austria, Spain and Portugal. The host partners will provide access to different European teams and coaching systems, which are each applauded as having world class records in talent identification, coupled with innovative coaching and enhanced player-development pathways.  Innovations in physiological development, coaching delivery and tactical analysis will be used to improve skills\u2019 acquisition for mobility participants. Improved employment rates for VET learners, with improved vocational attainment, enhanced accreditation and mobility certification will help improve career progression and job security for all participants. \r\n\r\nThe key competences that are to be acquired/improved are listed below:\r\n\r\n1.\tImproved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility                          programme.\r\n2.\tSkills and technology transfer between the mobility apprentices and players and coaches in Europe.\r\n3.\tImproved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n4.\tImproved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country.\r\n5.\tIncreased maturity, initiative and increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n6.\tEnhanced cultural awareness.\r\n7.\tIncreased participation and retention rates in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 football.\r\n8.\tEnhancement of soft skills.\r\n9.\tIncreased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n10.\tCloser links between VET Providers in Wales and Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh FA will allocate a sum equivalent to 10% of the total budget to fund dissemination before, during and after the mobility period.", "http://www.welshfootballtrust.org.uk", "FAW Football in the Community trading as Welsh Football Trust", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012873_coordinator"]]}}, "4TS": {"esif": {"data": [[1456790400000, 1609372800000, "Upskilling at Work SO2 EW", "Coleg Gwent", "Providing opportunities for employers to offer accredited trainingleading to qualifications to their workforce.", "ESF", 2762531.0, 5705353.0, "esf_wales_80897"], [1456790400000, 1609372800000, "Upskilling at Work SO1 EW", "Coleg Gwent", "Providing opportunities for employers to offer accredited trainingleading to qualifications to their workforce.", "ESF", 1866049.0, 3853833.0, "esf_wales_80921"]]}}, "4XJ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1241136000000, 1348963200000, "High efficiency hybrid drive trains for small and medium sized marine craft", "EnerSys Limited", "Marine diesel electric and hybrid drive systems have been used in large ships and submarines for many years but have not yet been successfully transferred to smaller craft, despite claims to the contrary. Numerous attempts have been made, some very recent, but all have been sub optimal and most have failed completely. These failures are due to a lack of underpinning research and of certain key components. The project has the following objectives: Zero emissions to air and zero external noise and vibration in port Reduction of overall fuel consumption by 30%, tending to &gt;90% on applications such as long distance sailing boats using regenerative techniques CO2 reduction of &gt;30% in all \u201coff design point\u201d applications (e.g.fishing boats and small commercial ferries) 50% reduction in HC &amp; NOx The market for small hybrid drive systems is tens of thousands of units and the aggregate social and environmental benefits are substantial. A holistic approach will be taken to total energy consumption and production on board. At the centre of the new system will be a comprehensive energy management module which will supervise and control energy flows in and out of a specially designed battery bank. The NMEA 2000 standard will be developed as necessary for the new data formats. Safety issues will be addressed by developing new ISO standards. The following research, development and validation will be carried out: High efficiency, low speed, torque following propeller Rim drive propulsor using an embedded permanent magnet DC (PMDC) motor and contra rotating blades Load following, dynamic PMDC motor and generator controllers High efficiency DC to DC converters High efficiency AC to high voltage DC multi output battery charger Control algorithms for key components The final deliverables will be a validated hybrid drive system for small craft, a design tool, critical new components including a new propeller, and contributions to NMEA and ISO standards.", 41280.0, 2600768.0, 7, 11, "HYMAR", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2013-06/57677.jpg", "fp7_92079_996701482"]]}}}}
