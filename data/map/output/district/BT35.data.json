It responds to the problem of increasing fragmentation in the field of innovation promotion, especially the dislocation between those who generate knowledge that could spur innovation (HEIs), and those who can translate that knowledge into marketable strategies and use it to produce economic growth (SMEs).  Since the SME sector accounts for 99% of all businesses, provides two thirds of private sector jobs and contributes more than half of the total value-added created by businesses in the EU, the implementation of greater innovation in SMEs in an effective and cost \u2013efficient way is vital to fulfilling not only Europe\u2019s economic objectives, but also those of a more equal and productive society with higher social and economic integration.To achieve its goals, the project entails: \u2022 Development of 4 Territorial Innovation Alliances involving 70+ stakeholders in 5 countries (Ireland + UK,  Germany, Spain, Romania)  \u2022 The development, piloting, publishing and promotion of open access, digital learning resource for European SMEs, training them in the specific skills needed for engaging in innovation transfer with HEIs and Horizon 2020 projects  \u2022 The development, piloting, publishing and promotion of a multimedia Comparative Study and Case Study Guide for Innovation Transfer presenting effective and cost effective solutions for transmitting HEI research to SME contextThe project will consolidate cooperation as a key feature of the knowledge economy, reshaping traditional roles by multiplying outlets for HEIs to generate direct economic impact from their work, and breaking down barriers so that SMEs of all shapes and sizes can actively implement academic-based innovation to boost their own competitiveness, and that of the wider economy.", "http://www.nmea.net", null, "erasmus_554187-EPP-1-2014-1-IE-EPPKA2-KA_7"], [2014, "Regional Education and Employment Alliances", "NEWRY AND MOURNE CO-OPERATIVE LTD", 175870.0, 5, 7, "Youth unemployment remains persistently high in Ireland and across Europe and is increasingly impacting young university students, who after graduating, struggle to find employment commensurate to their knowledge and skills.  REAL aims to empower young unemployed or underemployed graduates to become entrepreneurs and high value employees in a short period after leaving university. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to do so we will firstly create two Regional Employment and Education Alliances.  This new strategy involves bringing together stakeholders in employment, education and economic development - such as VET providers, universities and colleges, enterprise development agencies and local authorities) - to jointly explore the structural issues that generate a skills mismatch between university educated students and the current labour market, inventory existing resources and commit to collaborative actions to address these issues in a REAL Action Plan.  We will systematize the process and lessons learned in the form of REAL Toolkit, which will be published and actively promoted as a means of replicating the Alliances in other regions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a first concrete outcome of the collaboration espoused by the Alliance, we will then develop, test, publish and promote a dynamic training course, \u201cInnovation for Enterprise and Employment\u201d directly targeted at recent graduates, and especially at arts and humanities graduates, among whom the rate of un/der employment is greatest.  Unlike current innovation courses which are highly academic in focus or aimed at start up entrepreneurs with a fixed business idea, and which too often teach innovation based on technological invention, our course will introduce learners to the contemporary understanding of innovation, focussing on the psychological/personality drivers of creativity as the basis of innovation and which acknowledge the importance of non-technological innovation to create value.  This approach is of utmost relevance to arts and humanities graduates whose skills are likely to be of great use in the service sector; indeed, the course will particularly highlight the opportunities for innovative graduates in the creative industries, a high growth area in partners\u2019 own regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREAL is delivered by a cross-sectoral partnership led by Louth County Council (Ireland), known for its commitment to collaboration as a means to pursuing excellence.  They will be joined by Newry and Mourne Cooperative (UK) an enterprise agency specialising in VET training and regional economic development programmes, with whom they will deliver the cross border Alliance.  Univations (Germany), the enterprise training arm of the Martin Luther King University whose holistic approach to innovation training is reflected in highly successful online learning platform \u201cUnivations Academy\u201d and the University of Szczecin (Poland) will work on the second crossborder Alliance, the latter being known for its work on innovation in services which has contributed to development of highly successful cluster of creative businesses in its region.     The partnership is completed by Canice Consulting, an international consultancy in the field of business VET with a growing specialism in digital learning and marketing and Mindshare Consulting, whose Director is a recognised authority in innovation education and new pedagogical approaches. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of our project, the 60 graduates who participate in the Innovation for Enterprise and Education course will grow confident in their understanding and application of innovation as relevant to their chosen career and are more likely to become self-employed entrepreneurs or gain employment commensurate to their education because their skills and knowledge are more suited for the current employment market.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt organizational level, the project provides VET providers and HEIs with real motivation to integrate the learning course into their own portfolio of services, as it is a high quality, cost effective solution to a real demand they are facing. In this process of appropriation, even if others modify and enrich our materials, we will have completed our goal of mainstreaming innovation education for arts and humanities\u2019 graduates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a more structural level, participants of the Alliances will increase their understanding of causes and manifestations of the skills mismatch, gain exposure to more intelligent, collaborative approaches to overcome it, and directly apply solutions best suited to their region. They will better fulfil their organizational mission to benefit young graduates (be it education, employment or economic development) and will do so in a cost effective way (by pooling resources).

NVP Energy presents the first to market, high-rate AD technology that successfully treats low strength wastewater (WW) at ambient temperatures (4 - 20\u00b0C). The low-temperature anaerobic digestion (Lt-AD) process provides a novel solution to Food and Drinks industrial sectors which produce large volumes of WW. The European milk treatment and processing sector alone generates over 367 billion litres annually which is typically treated using conventional aerobic processes. The latter treatment process is unsustainable. It results in high sludge yields, requires a large footprint on-site and is hugely reliant on fossil fuels for aeration. The Lt-AD technology produces negligible sludge volumes, presents a compact design, requires no heat input or biogas recirculation, and produces effluent of urban wastewater directive (UWWD) standard (< 125 mg/L COD) without post-aeration. Comparing Lt-AD to conventional aerobic treatment of WW from a typical dairy processing plant producing 2,000 m3 WW per day, Lt-AD can provide annual OPEX savings of \u20ac1,662,106 p.a over a payback period of 2.49 years that includes RHI revenue of \u20ac374,176. The low temperature operation of Lt-AD allows for 100% of the biogas produced being available for reuse or resale.

The placements always last for 2 weeks, this year SRC intends to send 103 students for 2 weeks and 3 students will undertake Erasmus pro placements of  3 months. These long term mobilities were not envisaged as part of our 5 year European Internationalisation Strategy (EIS) however SRC international team have consulted with staff who believe this is a great opportunity for VET students who are over 18 and are completing their level 3 health and early years programme.\r\n\r\nSRC is committed to internationalisation and a new International Strategy was agreed in 2015 with KPIs.   Key objectives include:\r\n> To widen the range of European exchange opportunities for staff and students by 20% each year to 2020 e.g. KA1;\r\n>To increase the number of visits to European companies and host organisations by 10% each year to 2020;\r\n>To facilitate the sharing of best practice with other regional colleges and international colleges and organisations e.g. KA2;\r\n>To develop and implement a range of strategies supported through Information Systems and Technology that would further enhance European internationalisation; \r\n>To investigate and develop opportunities in ECVET;\r\nThe Erasmus+ programme is viewed as being central to reaching these objectives.\r\n\r\nThe proposed MOVE UP project will enable 103 VET learners  to undertake a two-week placement within various European settings. \r\n This will enhance their knowledge, know-how, skills, competencies required in their particular occupations as well as build soft skills e.g. confidence, team-working, living and working in a global society.  \r\n\r\nThe learners involved will be both VET students and apprentices undertaking work placements within a European setting tailored to meet their individual needs. \r\n\r\nThe VET students and apprentices will be recruited from Health and Early Years and Public Services.\r\n\r\nTherefore opportunities will be promoted to learners throughout the  entire College.

In the first strand, we primarily intend to prepare the theoretical backgrounds in the College of Central London and, building on these, develop bi-national educational modules. In a second strand, we intend to involve apprentices and test, improve and extend these modules in cooperation with the SRC in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the project, the staff of the three colleges involved will mutually enrich their professional expertise. Further pieces of the training we aim for are information on the British vocational educational system, comparison of methodical and didactic approaches, job-shadowing and industrial placements in local companies, comparison of national educational laws, rules and regulations, and comparison of national standards as to tests and examinations. This expertise will find its way into the bi-national (English/German) educational modules, which are based on the different national curricula.\r\n\r\nThe testing stage of the created educational modules will be put into practice in the course of the planned IVT project with Northern Irish \u2013 German student teams at the SRC.\r\nThe mutual educational goal in this extraordinary learning environment should be considered a pattern that can be transferred to larger educational modules. The training project also aims at the possibility of an English final examination that might be acknowledged by the British Chamber of Commerce. That is, in this case, the participants should take an examination in the course of this particular learning module. The results of this examination are expected to show whether students are able to participate in the final examination of the British Chamber of Commerce in the course of a subsequent longer and more time-consuming training project.\r\n\r\nThis particular learning module is about planning, assembling and controlling a conveyor belt, using also pre-machined and pre-manufactured components and assemblies. Further details are the principle of operation of the conveyor belt, including the chosen equipment such as drives, sensors and actuators. In the course of the project, it is also necessary to apply respectively transfer basic knowledge in the field of PLC programming, deepen that particular knowledge and control the conveyor belt with a PLC. The option of networking several conveyors in a successive stage is also integrated in the module.\r\nFurthermore, the students will become acquainted with country specific technical systems and different approaches. As the target hardware and the target software platforms of the colleges vary, it is necessary to adapt them to further a common international standard.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the participants will acquire intercultural and social skills and lose the fear of close contact with citizens of other countries. Also the general language skills of the participants and especially the practical use of technical terms will improve.

Viewpoints to Multiculturalism\u201d is a joint student and teacher mobility project coordinated by Salpaus Further Education and realized by Sanare, a network of Finnish vocational institutions and education providers. The network partners are Finland\u2019s Diaconia College, The Federation of Education in Jokilaaksot/Ylivieska Vocational College, South Ostrobothnia Folk High School, Rovaniemi Municipal Federation of Education/Lapland Vocational College, The Federation of Education in Central Ostrobothnia, and Kemi-Tornionlaakso Municipal Educational and Training Consortium Lappia/Vocational College Lappia. The project is carried out in co-operation with our foreign partners in Spain, Denmark, Czech Republic and the UK. In choosing the partners, versatility has been taken into account to the effect that there are on-the-job learning places both for practical nursing students and for youth and leisure instructor students. In addition, the foreign partners have experience of multiculturalism, the central theme in the current project. The on-the-job learning places are in day care centres, schools and in care units for the elderly and the disabled. In the \u201cVlog Up!\u201d project there will be altogether 54 student mobilities and 14 staff mobilities.  \r\n\r\nThe Sanare network has carried out international projects previously, too, the most recent one being the Erasmus+ KA1 project \u201cIlona \u2013 voluntary work as part of the welfare field\u201d (2015-17). The previous experiences in collaboration act as a starting point in the current project. Thus, the practices that have proved to be good previously, as well as the designation of assignments within the network, are adopted to efficient use in the current project.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to increase the knowledge possessed by the applying network and the collaborating working life networks about the opportunities and challenges of multiculturalism in the European partner countries and in this way promote a new kind of European sense of community and equality. This goal is reached through video blogs, or vlogs, produced by the students taking part in the mobility periods. \r\n\r\nThe Sanare network has international partners, of which the ones chosen to be in this project are the ones with the most experience of supervising students from different cultural backgrounds and in whose staff and/or clients the multicultural dimension has traditionally been present. \r\n\r\nAs the concrete result of the project there will be, in addition to the mobility weeks, video blogs made by the participating students. In these vlogs, the various manifestations and forms of multiculturalism, as encountered in the on-the-job learning places abroad, are recorded and presented. The vlogs are recorded using for example cameras, smartphones and tablets. The students will update the vlogs in real time during the on-the-job learning periods. The vlogs will be advertised on the websites of the participating colleges. The vlogs can also be used for example in the marketing campaigns of the colleges, in parents\u2019 nights, and in staff education. \r\n\r\nThe mobility periods are recognized using the Europass mobility certificate. In addition, the mobility periods are recognized as on-the-job learning periods belonging to the students\u2019 qualifications as an obligatory part. \r\n\r\nThe various activities of the project are planned in detail in the autumn of 2017. At the same time, orientation is arranged for the first students going abroad in the spring of 2018. The staff mobility periods will take place in an early stage of the project, mostly in the autumn of 2017.

We have observed in our own school a drop in the level of language with which our pupils enter the school system, seeing how our colleagues work developing early language skills we believe will be of benefit.\r\nNumeracy- Finland and Spain-We have observed how Finland uses learning styles as a basis to sort pupils into groups, with no regress to age and we feel that this approach would work with our proposed CPA approach to Maths. And both schools are working with 3rd level Institutes and we will have the opportunity to share expertise in the field of 'Action Research'.\r\nICT: Finland and Republic of Ireland, our colleagues in these schools use 2 different approaches to ICT provision within their schools, Finland has a designated ICT suite, something which we are in the process of developing and Republic of Ireland has a BYO device approach where pupils bring their own tablets, devices to school for use. We would like the opportunity to compare both systems and evaluate the pros and cons of each and this will ultimately influence our choice of ICT equipment to furnish the suite.", "http://www.stmarys.mullaghbawn.ni.sch.uk", "St Mary's Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035963_coordinator"], [2014, "Welcoming Europe into the Class", "St Mary's Primary School", 36447.0, 6, 6, "With the evolution of technology it is now possible for us to have the whole of Europe at the touch of a button in our classrooms.

What next then? Simple a Virtual Learning Environment a VLE, a place to store, access from anywhere, and share the bank of wonderful resources we have built up and are continuing to build through co-operating in projects with our European partners.\r\n\r\n This dream can easily become a reality we have the enthusiasm and are ready for the challenge but we need funding to help us achieve this. Funding will allow us to access the expertise of people working in this field, this will enable us to create a tailored made resource which meets the needs of our school. We can train staff, pupils and parents in its use and maintenance and give them access and the support to develop areas within where they can have autonomy over their learning.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to work alongside our European School partners, Basque Country, (Spain), Republic of Ireland, Finland, Greece, and Italy to develop resources to share for the mutual benefit of our pupils, in languages, the environment, the people and the places in which we live. A VLE will give us the perfect safe environment to share, exhibit and exchange information and ideas.\r\n\r\n We will provide opportunities for our staff to travel and visit other educational settings- where they will have the opportunity to not only experience school life in another setting but also the culture and traditions of that country.

Staff will have the opportunity to broaden their horizons through travel, they will experience the culture and traditions of other nationalities. They will have opportunities to learn and build upon their existing language skills. Ultimately they will have time away from school to share new experiences with other members of staff, many of whom will never have worked closely together, thus it will help to break down barriers and promote team work within our organisation.", "http://www.stmarys.mullaghbawn.ni.sch.uk", "St Mary's Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002154_coordinator"], [2014, "Path to e-Maturity", "St Mary's Primary School", 29653.0, 3, 3, "Scoil Eoin P\u00f3l, Loch an I\u00fair is a small rural school in Donegal, Ireland, with a vision of creating an e-Mature school, that will use best international practice to guide its implementation\r\n\r\nHaving gained valuable insight into the European culture of ICT through blogging and web conferencing in our previous  Comenius project, we feel confident now in developing our own Virtual Learning Environment, and in progressing to the next level of e-maturity. We as a staff believe that training and job-shadowing on a European platform, will be the best motivation staff and pupils will have in implementing the new Action Plan with regards ICT in our school, and developing ICT within International work.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of our project are to:\r\n\r\n*become an e-mature school\r\n\r\n*developing an Virtual Learning Platform through Moodle\r\n\r\n*recognising International and European best practice in ICT\r\n\r\n*developing staff competencies in using ICT\r\n\r\n*developing staff e-confidence\r\n\r\n*Understanding and implementing e-safety in our school \r\n\r\n*developing and promoting the use of iPads and tablets, enabling remote access learning\r\n\r\n*promoting 'Google Apps for Education' as a means of mass storage for pupils\r\n\r\n* sustaining Good Digital Citizenship\r\n\r\nThe whole school staff will be involved in this project.\r\n\r\nWe are 2 full time teachers and a 2 part-time teachers on our staff. We also want to include our ancillary staff and assistants in these mobilities and training, as they will be instrumental in the implementation and success of this project.\r\n\r\nStaff members (6 in total) have varying levels of competencies in ICT- some with basic skills and others with more advanced skills. Our aim is to make sure that no staff member will feel left behind or inadequate in their application of technology. Thus, we have chosen staff training courses of different levels of ability and challenge, to suit the needs of our staff. Combined, these courses will help diffuse the technical challenges of ICT in our school, and promote the attainment of the aims and objectives of the project.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\n\r\nWe want to identify the best way that our school can set up a Virtual Learning Platform, and develop our e-maturity.\r\n\r\nWe would like to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\nIs e-maturity within our grasp?\r\n\r\nWill setting up a Virtual Learning Environment benefit the participation and engagement of pupils?\r\n\r\nWill staff e-confidence help promote an e-learning culture within our school?\r\n\r\nAre there advantages in working towards a hybrid classroom?\r\n\r\nCan we overcome issues with e-safety?\r\n\r\nHow can International Policy and best practice help us achieve our vision?\r\n\r\nWill ICT training enhance our teaching?\r\n\r\nWe will use a combination of qualitative and quantitative data to guide our approach.\r\n\r\nWe hope to use descriptive research methodology along with staff, pupil and parent questionnaires during the life of the project. Random sampling of teachers and pupils will be used to obtain a representative sample of attitudes towards our e-maturity project.\r\n\r\nOnce the training and job-shadowing has been completed, we expect the results to be very positive. We expect this project to have a great impact on our staff, pupils and wider school community. We hope to be a school at the fore of e-Learning in our county, and to encourage other schools to also take a leap of faith onto the path of e-maturity. As regards our school, this project will incorporate an important international element that will make our pupils and school community feel less remote and cut-off from our neighbouring counterparts. Living on the periphery of Europe has left us isolated and independent, but through this project we hope to integrate better with our European partners, through networking and face to face encounters.\r\n\r\nPupils will be given opportunities to learn online, on a secure platform, at their own pace. Moodle will be able to engage them for longer, and they will become active participants in their own learning. Assessment of Learning will take place, as others with vested interest in the project will help provide feedback to pupils on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nThe longterm benefits of this project are endless, as we could potentially work with our partners in Spain, United Kingdom and elsewhere on a Moodle collaboration, in which KA2 activities could be conducted. This Virtual Learning Platform would provide an ideal secure platform where pupils and teachers could interact before, during and after their strategic partnership mobilities, and where pupils from a small rural school in Donegal could interact with their peers across Europe, within a common learning theme.\r\n\r\nWith the evolution of technology it is now possible for us to have the whole of Europe at the touch of a button in our classrooms.

Background:Since 1946 our centre has developed itself as an innovative school with a vision that enables students to meet the new challenges of a rapidly changing society like ours. On the basis of our own identity and culture, we open ourselves to the broad and comprehensive conception of Europe and the world, respecting different social and cultural realities around us. It is within this background that we intend to expand our horizons in order to have an overview of education in Europe and to give our students the opportunity to benefit from other European educational contexts, keeping their own identity at the same time.2. The objectives of the project include-To ensure staff mobility within Europe, in order to improve their skills and to guide the educational process-To develop teaching skills to articulate formal, non-formal and informal learning, internationalization and integration into the European labour market-To develop an understanding of the social, cultural and linguistic diversity-To improve language skills and the use of ICT-To increase motivation and teachers' satisfaction at work-To increase motivation and involvement of students throughout their learning process-To identify opportunities for personal and professional growth-To facilitate cooperation with partners in the educational systems within the EU in order to exchange good teaching practices, to carry out projects and international partnerships-To develop management skills in international projects-To promote the policies, practices, methodologies and knowledge about European educational systems to the school faculty3.

MethodologyAccording to our school philosophy, our methodology carried out throughout the project is based in cooperative work and team work of all the staff, with the aim to disseminate the acquired knowledge to our students and faculty members. In accordance with the teaching-learning process of our students, the methodology used by the members of the commission of the project will be based on the experience and direct observation to promote a critical spirit.6. Results and long term benefitsThroughout the project the following documentation will be issued:- Europass Mobility Documents- Certificates of participation in mobilities- Training diplomas issued by an authorized centre by the European Commission- Individual Plans for the broadcasting of mobility activities- CV Europass- Europass Language PassportExpected long term benefits:-To obtain a global and diverse vision of the European educational system-To motivate the faculty to continuous training and mobility-To revise and update our School Plan to increase the quality of the teaching-learning process-To promote the desire  to investigate, to use ICT and foreign languages in a real and meaningful context and to develop abilities of creative thinking, personal growth and strategies7. ProfileSuitable candidates for each of the mobilities of the project are selected through a transparent and equanime process. The criteria of this selection is detailed in Section F of this project.", "http://www.stmarys.mullaghbawn.ni.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-024150_2"], [2014, "Harviala school staff mobilities", "St Mary's Primary School", 12546.0, 3, 3, "Harviala school is a medium-sized Finnish primary school with a total of 120 pupils aged 7-12. Our school is located in Janakkala municipality, close to the city of H\u00e4meenlinna. A nursery school operates in the same premises with the school, nevertheless as an administratively separate unit. Since 2010 our school has run a co-operation program with the pre-school group to make the transition pois from pre-school to primary school as easy as possible. The pupils in pre-school, 1st and 2nd grades are taught environment and nature studies in workshops using mainly co-operative learning and the pupils are divided according to their individual learning styles. The teachers involved in this program work tightly together as a team in planning and teaching the lessons.The results have been very positive and due to them, the cooperation program of co-teaching environment and nature studies cross-curricularly and putting different age groups together in one teaching group will be widened to concern the upper grades in our school, too. For the transition in the teaching method it would be essential for our teachers to visit other European schools and see how team teacing, co-teaching and teaching environment and nature studies as a subject itself is implemented. This would be the first main focusing point of our project. We have planned two job-shadowing periods in two European schools and the idea is that each teacher in our school will attend a 5-day job-shadowing period in either of these schools and learn new procedures, ways of teaching, positive attitudes towards teamwork and of course positive attitudes towards international co-operation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second main focus is ICT. ICT skills are used in every subject at school and both teachers and pupils need to learn vital digital skills. To be able to teach our pupils safe and varied uses of ICT, the teachers need constantly to be trained to be familiar with the new possibilities. Social media and its devices are strongly present at people's everyday life. Smartphones and tablets with cloud services offer endless possibilities also for educational purposes. How to effectively use the social media, cloud services, tablets, smart phones and for example a learning database in teaching, will be the areas in which we would like to improve our teachers' skills in the future. Being able to use the assistive technologies and special applications for tablets and smartphones will also give us another mean to differentiate, help and support pupils with learning difficulties. The planned action in this project will be two separate courses aimed at the teaching staff to improve their skills at using tablets and the educational applications available, and moreover, to learn to make our own applications which we can use specifically for the benefit of our pupils. The courses are arranged in Belgium and Austia and four members of our teaching staff will attend these 5-day courses. The teachers will be selected mainly based on their motivation and need for improving their professional skills.\r\n\r\nAs the third \"silent\" focus in this project we see internationalization. Our school has been actively involved with Comenius cooperation since 2000 and we are proud of  that. Working on different Comenius projects have brought Europe closer to our staff and pupils, made them more aware, and at the same time also curious, about other European countries and cultures and, most importantly, dispelled a lot of prejudices agains different cultures. Making new contacts and being able to discuss with European colleagues face-to face in this project will evolve new ideas for further cooperation in the future. \r\n\r\nThe planned co-teaching project in our school will be carried our in any case in the near future and we think that this European mobility project will help our teachers to adjust to the idea of cooperation and teacmwork. The impacts of job-shadowing activites will be shown in the teachers' everyday work,  opening positive attitudes towards teamwork, co-teaching possibilites, and positive attitudes towards European co-operation. The planned courses for our staff will improve the teachers' ICT skills and by learning from each other we will gain another mean to differentiate and thus motivate our pupils. Skills in using tablets and social media and their educational applications in a safe, effective way will benefit our school for a long time, no matter what subject is concerned.", "http://www.stmarys.mullaghbawn.ni.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FI01-KA101-000225_2"]]}}}}
