In most cases, reduced uterine blood flow restricts substrate delivery to the fetus causing growth to slow or cease. There is no treatment. Currently the fetus is delivered very preterm before fetal death or irreversible organ damage occurs. Affected neonates suffer intracranial haemorrhage, chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy, with heart disease and diabetes as adults; mortality is high. Recent improvements in the care of premature growth restricted neonates, means that more of them survive delivery, but at great cost. Small increases in fetal growth and gestation at birth are associated with major improvements in survival and morbidity.\nImproving uterine blood flow is key and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is important to achieve this. In preclinical animal models we showed that local VEGF gene transfer to the uteroplacental circulation using adenovirus vectors increases uterine blood flow, attenuates constriction of uterine arteries and increases angiogenesis; these changes result in improved growth of severely growth restricted fetuses. This is the first clinically-applicable evidence based therapy that could improve perinatal outcome in severe early onset FGR in man.\nIn collaboration with an SME experienced in gene therapy trials, our aim is to complete an agreed toxicology programme, identify specific ethical issues in stakeholders, and to perform a Phase I/II study in women with severe early onset FGR at four EU centres of excellence, using interventional radiology to deliver an adenovirus vector containing the mature processed form of human VEGF-D into the uterine artery.

Although outcome for patients has improved, stents still fail because of the occurrence of restenosis and thrombosis at the site of implantation. While drug eluting stents have helped to reduce the problem of restenosis, neointimal proliferation causing restenosis can still occur. Additional concerns exist regarding drug eluting stents as there appears to be a small but real increase in late and very late stent thrombosis, particularly after discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy.\nThe novel concept we propose is use of a biodegradable magnetised stent (BMS) to deliver a novel biological therapy offering regenerative medicine solutions to the coronary artery vessel wall. Specifically we will develop the stent technology as a platform to attract autologous progenitor cells tagged in vitro with iron nanoparticles. Once deployed, the cells will be attracted to the already implanted BMS and proliferate to form a new endothelium. We will also use over-expression of the NRP1 gene in the artery wall where it will dimerise with NRP1 receptors on the deployed cells. The NRP1 gene will be transfected by adenovirus delivered from the wall of the BMS. Over time the BMS will undergo a predictable degradation to leave a wholly biological artery through regeneration of native tissues.\nCurrently, about 12,000 European Citizens a year suffer from late in-stent thrombosis and 120,000 from restenosis.

Cobots are brought closer to end-user SMEs through testing and interacting in the relevant industry conditions by SME management and other stakeholders in regional manufacturing economies.\nCOTEMACO engages with 60 SMEs from automotive and food sectors in the field labs via voucher schemes. Working with 50 of these SMEs, COTEMACO is also working towards implementing collaborative robotics through international cooperation. This will maintain >\u20ac500M of regional turnover and >1250 NWE manufacturing jobs, and generate >\u20ac50M and > 125 new jobs. Replication across other sectors and regions will ensure long-term financing sustainability of field labs (private contracts), exploring the potential of additional funding to be paired with regional sources.", 1514764800000, 1640908800000, 46674.0, "nweurope_14_4"]]}}, "3BQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "CLIL - kluczem do sukcesu", "Westgate Academy", 32366.0, 3, 3, "The project 'CLIL - the key to success' will be carried out in \u0141odygowice in the South of Poland. There are about 400 students who attend the school aged 6-19.\r\nObjectives:\r\n - to improve the quality of teaching and  to get to know the application of CLIL and the application of technology in every class\r\n - to develop language competence among teachers  and develop staff competences, apply new teaching methods and use online tools\r\n - to develop the European dimension and to gain the ability to work with emigrants with little or no knowledge of Polish\r\n - to meet participants from all over Europe \r\n - to exchange ideas, compare pracitises and introduce new ideas to the school \r\n - to increase the number of students taking international KET, PET, FCE,  exams\r\n - to develop social competence (f.e. self-confidence, tolerance)\r\n - to develop communcations skills for EU cooperation (meeting skills, negotiating strategies, telephoning skills, making presentations and report writing)\r\nThe participants:\r\nThe participants of the projects are teachers who would like to develop mainly their language competence and to affect the teaching quality. The teachers who were chosen to represent the school teach: Geography, History, IT, Polish, PE, Art and English. They are well educated in the field of their subjects and motivated to learn something new. The aim is to achieve the minimum level of english B1-B2 and to be able to run their subjects in english using CLIL method and take part in education European projects. The English teachers' aims are to improve their teaching skills and to provide new ideas and authentic materials to english classes.\r\nActions:\r\nThe main activities of the projects include the staff participation on the General English Courses and methodology courses for english teachers and job shadowing visits in Italy and in the UK. As a school we would like to develop a school partnership for on-going curriculum development and longer-term mutually beneficial links through programmes such as eTwinning and also to set up an on-going exchange between the pupils from each school through video-conferencing, emails, podcasting and postal mail in the future.\r\nBefore the mobility the staff will take part in english courses to prepare them for the moblility and after the mobility they will continue the courses to achieve the minimum level of B1-B2. The English teachers will assist with the praparation of staff and support the others. They will also prepare themseves to mobility by revising the aspects of teaching english and methodology. The English teachers will get to know fresh and communicative approaches to teaching English by experiencing a range of practical teching techniques and using CLIL and ICT in the classroom. They will also refresh and develop their English language proficiency. All the participants will also receive the cultural preparation for their cultural experience.\r\nThe courses and job shadowing will use a wide variety of communicative activities to develop language competence as well as providing practical and creative classroom ideas. Participants will take part in seminars, workshop, lectures, open discussions and observations.\r\nThe exact content of the course and job shadowing will be negotiated before to take into account the specific needs and developing interests of participant and institutions.\r\nResults:\r\na.1. on the school after the mobility\r\n - improving the quality of teaching and using CLIL in bilinguial classes\r\n - recognizability of school locally and in the county\r\n - increasing the number of students taking KET, PET and FCE exams\r\n - using new technologies in the classroom (ICT, TIK, CALL)\r\n - developing new and better teaching methods and innovative approaches to learning\r\n - increasing intercultural awareness and preparing participants for working with partners from other cultural backgrounds\r\n - positive impact on students, their motivation and European awareness\r\n a.2. on individual participants\r\n - improving the skills and competences (language and social) and gain confidence in using English \r\n - developing basic and transversal skills, such as digital skills and multilingualism in all fields of education\r\n - increasing motivation and satisfaction in teachers' daily work\r\n - created a network of teaching contacts within Europe", "http://www.westgate.lincs.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PL01-KA101-037260_2"]]}}, "3DY": {"cordis": {"data": [[1317427200000, 1396224000000, "Creative Little Scientists: Enabling Creativity through Science and Mathematics in Preschool and First Years of Primary Education", "Bishop Grosseteste University College Lincoln", "Science and mathematics education is important for Europe. Creativity and innovation are equally recognised as important, and their strengthening in and through education as a vital priority. Importantly, also, creativity holds a strong position in early childhood. The Creative Little Scientists project constitutes a timely contribution to a better understanding, at the European level, of the potential available on the common ground that science and mathematics education in pre-school and early primary school can share with creativity. It provides a clear picture of existing and possible practices, as well as their implications and the related opportunities and challenges. Based on this, the project proposes guidelines, curricula and exemplary materials for relevant teacher training in the various European contexts. The research findings and outcomes are carefully disseminated, in easy to use formats, to all stakeholders at the European level. To achieve these, the Creative Little Scientists project brings together a consortium comprising expertise of the highest level and quality in the areas of science and mathematics education in early childhood, creativity in education, cognitive psychology, comparative educational studies, and teacher training.
