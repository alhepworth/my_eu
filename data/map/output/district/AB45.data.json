Our aim is to engage and demonstrate the importance of language learning in opening doors for our pupils and community for their future in learning, life and work.  The acquisition of more than one language provides transferable skills which can be used throughout life. Our community at Banff Primary, is diverse and multi-cultural.  We need to celebrate this diversity and we feel this project gives us a platform in order to do this.  Within our improvement framework we are currently aiming to and making steps towards improving the learning and teaching across many curricular areas but mainly in Literacy and Numeracy.  \r\n\r\nNeeds/Preparation\r\n1. A large part of our school improvement plan is to develop and encourage the competence of staff and learners in their understanding of the French methodologies, language and culture. \r\n2. The staff members involved will endeavor to enhance their current knowledge of the French language and complete personal research prior to attending the immersion course.  This will allow them to get the most out of their time in country and when they return.\r\n3. The staff involved consist of a member of management and teachers from all stages of the school.  This will enable the participants to gain a holistic perspective thereby allowing for widespread and effective implementation.  \r\n4. Banff has quite recently become a hugely multi-cultural society therefore we would aim to raise the profile of language learning in our learning community, wider community and cluster.\r\n5. Prior to embarking upon the immersion course, we wish to establish an e-twinning link with a school in France.  This will give learners a real life opportunity to experience the French language and culture. \r\n\r\nPlanned Outcomes during immersion\r\n1. The participants will each keep a professional learning logbook throughout the experience. This will detail any notes taken from the course and also any reflections that might prove useful. \r\n2.  Resources relevant to our school will be gathered to disseminate on return. \r\n3. Throughout the course we will engage in professional dialogue with other participants to share best practice.  \r\n\r\nImplementation\r\n1. On return we will continue our own personal self-evaluation and consider how best to take this forward in our own classroom practice. \r\n2. Once we have established our own aims and targets we will share our vision with the head teacher before preparing for staff  training. \r\n3. To enthuse our young learners it would be vital to share our experiences through assemblies and other such forums. \r\n3. In order to take this forward we will look at staff competency and identify needs across the school.\r\n4. Following on from our initial Parental engagement we will determine how best to advance this. \r\n5. Once piloted in school, staff will share guidelines and resources on how French is implemented at Banff Primary School.  As part of this we will work with the secondary to promote a successful progression thus resulting in a smoother transition for our learners.  \r\n6. We will also look at how our resources can be differentiated to best suit the needs of the learners in our school.  \r\n\r\nOutcome/Impact\r\n1. This course will improve staff competence and ability in the teaching of French. It will reinforce our already existing enjoyment and appreciation of the language. \r\n2. It will allow the learners to engage with the language thus promoting life-long skills and values.\r\n3.  Alongside the teachers self-evaluation, SMT will monitor the delivery of French throughout the school in order to assess the impact and effectiveness of the course.", "http://banff-pri.aberdeenshire.sch.uk/", "Banff Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035614_coordinator"]]}}}}
