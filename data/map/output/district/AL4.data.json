These aims are driven by the fact that the number of people entering VET has dropped across Europe in recent years, a fact which is contributing to growing skills mismatches within European labour markets. Therefore, policy makers and VET practitioners have begun to realise that there is a need to challenge misconceptions around the reality of contemporary VET in order to help position this educational pathway as a \u2018first-choice\u2019 once more for young people. \r\n\r\nLevel Up looks to contribute to this work by building an interactive tool for use in guidance sessions with young people that draws clear parallels between the learning outcomes found within work-based VET and career development. In part this approach will begin to breakdown stereotypes around VET routes being a second choice to academic tertiary education, by highlighting that learning outcomes in VET are as varied and complex as those found in university courses etc. At the same, the link which the tool will draw between VET and the labour market will demonstrate to young people the value which training within the VET sector has on long-term career progression. \r\n\r\nGiven that young people nowadays are all digital natives, an innovative use of ICT is needed to maximise the impact of project activities. As a result, the project will take a game-based learning (GBL) approach to the development of its outputs. A VET-based game will be built which allows young people to simulate progression through the VET system, by drawing on scenarios based on the learning outcomes, levels etc. found within work-based VET. By designing the GBL platform around the principles of flow theory, the project will look to demonstrate the diverse and challenging nature of VET through a medium which is proven to add an engaging, innovative dimension to traditional educational guidance for young people. Indeed, the interactive, \u2018fun\u2019 nature of the GBL platform will guide and inform young people, increasing their motivations for considering VET pathways by disseminating its information and guidance through a medium more normally associated with leisure and free-time. \r\n\r\nTo capitalise on players\u2019 increased motivation around VET, and to further challenge misconceptions and stereotypes, each game level will also link into complementary content found within the project\u2019s online portal. Here, both young people and the guidance practitioners who work with them will be able to find regional, national and European information on the careers benefits of VET, Labour Market and Skills Information, and further guidance on training routes etc. This will provide game players and professionals with the hard data and further information needed to inform decisions around VET pathways, by showing the concrete long-term impact of gaining such skills.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that these outputs are of the highest quality, the project will carry out extensive research into the current state of both GBL and the promotion of VET within European careers guidance. This research will inform all project activities, as well as feeding into practical resources for careers professionals, to help them further develop their own skills and confidence in embedding innovative ICT tools, such as GBL resources, into their work.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the project will draw on several European level tools and resources in its development. This is because it is felt that an open, transnational approach to the promotion of VET is needed in order to offer effective resources that highlight the diverse training routes and career opportunities found across Europe. This includes the European Qualifications Framework, as well as practical labour market tools such as Europass and EURES. Such an approach will help the project produce universal resources, which demonstrate the demand and opportunities for people with vocational skills to build careers on the local, national and European level.\r\n\r\nLevel Up looks to create an impact on the quality of guidance provided to young people considering education options by developing resources which both engage learners and upskill the support staff who work alongside them. In terms of staff development, the LMSI resources and guides to digital tools produced by the project will help to improve the quality and standard of guidance, as staff feel more confident in both promoting VET and using digital tools in their work. Similarly, this increased staff engagement, coupled with the direct interaction with young people through the GBL platform, will in turn mean young people are making better informed decisions about their education and training. Ultimately this will mean that they are developing skills more directly suited to the needs of the labour market, and so begin to address the skills mismatches found across Europe.", "http://www.capedkoala.com", "ASPIRE IGEN GROUP LIMITED", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA202-036643_1"], [2017, "Promoting Green Skills through Games", "Caped Koala Studios Ltd", 244646.0, 5, 5, "As identified in documents such as the UNESCO Roadmap for Implementing the Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development (2015), \u201cEducation for Sustainable Development (ESD) is about shaping a better tomorrow for all \u2013 and it must start today.\u201d Within this same document, it is identified under the priority action for building capacities of educators and trainers, that ESD should be \u201cintegrated into pre-service and in-service education and training for early childhood, primary and secondary school teachers, as well as teachers and facilitators in non-formal and informal education\u201d and that \u201cEducators are one of the most important levers to foster educational change and to facilitate learning for sustainable development\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will therefore develop a digital game, along with associated guidelines, good practice guides and training material to innovate and support improvements for students, and teachers and others within primary and secondary school systems\u2013 specifically in the areas of sustainability and environmental education. The primary project result will be a game, aimed at delivery of the afore-mentioned skills and knowledge through a Game-Based-Learning methodology, which will serve concurrently as a tool for teaching, simulation, practice and assessment. The proposed game and associated resources are ultimately suggested as elements which can be integrated as a common learning resources within a wide variety of contexts for primary and secondary school education. It will be possible to use the game as a stand-alone and largely automated resource or one which can be embedded into a larger curriculum, with guidelines and other resources being provided for its integration in a variety of classroom and training situations\r\n\r\nThe project team will achieve these goals in compliance with the program priorities for innovating and increasing the quality and range of initial and continuing training, including new pedagogies, ICT-based methodologies and use of open educational resources as well as the production and adoption of open education resources in diverse European languages.\r\n\r\nThe activities the strategic partnership will organize will follow the logical framework of the project implementation and progress and include: management, coordination and monitoring activities; activities dedicated to the production of the Intellectual Outputs and achieving the set objectives and outcomes and activities for dissemination, exploitation and provision of sustainability.\r\n\r\nResearch in which thorough research and analysis of the current \"state of the art\" of environmental and sustainable education in Europe will be conducted. This state of the art report will also include main conclusions and recommendations for facilitating environmental and sustainable education in primary and secondary schools. Following this, learning content will be developed for the subject-specific, transferable competencies for sustainability education and structured  in such a way that this content can be integrated and taught through a digital game. The developed game and appropriate educational assets will be iteratively designed, developed, tested and refined in order to create a highly-polished final product which will reside amongst worldwide commercial and educational games. Additionally, a \"toolkit\" for teachers containing guides, best practices and associated educational material will be developed to help educators in integrating the game in an educational setting. All resources will be hosted on an online platform, to function largely as a teacher/trainer support tool. Additionally, face to face and online training will be provided for primary and secondary students to help them integrate all project results into their educational activites.\r\n\r\nThe project is expected to have a significant impact on individual educators and their organisations across Europe, largely related to the developed game and resources as a means of providing a new and innovative approach to promoting sustainability and developing related skills in schools. It is anticipated that the resources developed during the project will complement and expand existing training initiatives at various educational levels across Europe and expand traditional teaching and learning practices to include new technologies. The project is expected to offer opportunities for the exchange of ideas and good practices with peers from across Europe through the proposed multiplier event, training sessions and the online platform.", "http://www.capedkoala.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IE01-KA201-025721_1"]]}}, "0JA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "ACER VETPRO4", "Oaklands College", 62975.0, 8, 17, "ACER VETPRO4 will continue a series of mobility project which enable colleges from the East of England to build links with European partners to enhance professional development and share expertise.  This project builds upon previous  projects which comprised 11 visits by 60 VET Lecturers to Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Czech Republic, Finland and Sweden, Lithuania, Cyprus, Portugal and Finland. The lecturers and managers representing 11 ACER colleges were drawn from specialisms including Construction, Motor Vehicle, Electronics, Agriculture, ICT, and Business Studies, Health and Social Care, Hospitality and Catering, Travel and Tourism and Leisure and Sport. The participants also explored to what extent the host country has matched its National Qualification Framework against the EQF and implemented the ECVET system. Resulting from these visits, networks, partnerships and two-way exchanges of staff and learners have already been established. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mobilities project will contribute to both individual continuous professional development (CPD) plans as well as continuing to develop long term strategic partnerships between Est of England Colleges and EU VET providers. Individuals will have the opportunity to widen their knowledge and expertise, including experience of different teaching and learning methodologies, innovations in technology and learning and diverse cultures to help to adapt training courses to meet employers changing skills needs.
