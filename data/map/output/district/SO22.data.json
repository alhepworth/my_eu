It is well known that this is a key issue that leads young people back into the spiral of offending.  Experience indicates that whilst many businesses offer opportunities to the very vulnerable, it is often difficult for them to sustain the offer.  This is because the issues facing the young people affect most, if not all, of their behaviour. Employers often do not know how to deal with what is perceived as poor behaviour and the default is to make them redundant. Employers need proper training to equip them for appropriate action to address issues with vulnerable young people. Where such transitions are made and apprenticeships are successful, we need to be explicit about what works and what does not. There is patchy and often anecdotal evidence but little substantial evidence-based work. The common theme emerging from existing work and experience is the need for social support: just getting someone a placement without an eye on the social support for a range of other issues is thought not to work by many professionals in the field. A web of support is therefore increasingly regarded as essential for helping the most vulnerable young people become constructive members of society.  There are indications that there is a need for common but multifaceted approach to supporting vulnerable young people through vocational education, training and apprenticeships. \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe key objectives are: 1) to explore the experiences of young people; 2) to identify the needs of employers; 3) to identify the needs of schools and VET trainers; 3) to map good practice; 4) to bring together practitioners; 5) to provide a model of evidence based social support requirements; 6) to share good practice beyond the immediate partnership.\r\n\r\nTarget group.\r\nThe direct beneficiaries of the project are VET providers, including both trainers/colleges and employers that provide apprenticeships and work placements for young people. In particular, there will be a focus on organisations that wish to give particular attention to vulnerable young people. This includes private companies; public bodies; social enterprises that aim to improve the lives of the vulnerable; NGOs that provide VET for their clients; schools that provide VET; prisons that provide VET to young offenders; local authorities who are often responsible for co-ordinating and providing VET.\r\n\r\nThe indirect beneficiaries of the project are the most vulnerable young people in society. We are using a broad age range from 16 to 25 in order to capture different definitions of \u2018young people\u2019 that are used across Europe.  Vulnerabilities relate to a wide range of often inter-related issues such as histories of violence and abuse, problematic drug and alcohol use, serious undiagnosed mental health issues, problematic family relationships, experience of offending and prison. This group includes young people from different ethnic origins, such as Roma; and includes young people who are migrants. Some of the most vulnerable young people are women who at particular risk of domestic violence, sexual abuse and sex work.\r\n\r\nExpected impact\r\nUltimately, the key impact will be on the lives of the most vulnerable young people in our society.  Successful apprenticeships enhance the lives, confidence, social and cultural capital of those young people and can help turn broken lives around, with attendant benefits for future generations.  For the VET providers, and in particular, employers, this project will raise awareness of the needs of these young people and also signpost them to appropriate support.", "http://www.amicaluk.com", "BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013612_7"]]}}, "4NR": {"creative": {"data": [[1430438400000, 1525046400000, "NE\u00a9XT Accelerator", "UNIVERSITY OF WINCHESTER", 839286.0, 11, 19, "NE\u00a9XT Accelerator: Creates transnational entry routes into international careers for generations of talented emerging artists, enabling them to make a living from creative production; Makes cultural/creative incubators more entrepreneurial, innovative and transnational; Boosts transnational mobility and entrepreneurial learning opportunities for arts graduates, art educators and incubator leaders; Celebrates cutting-edge artistic creation, transcending disciplines, genres, media and audiences; Connects young artists with cultural/creative players, sectors and businesses; Promotes national and European cultural and creative sectors as an engine of economic and social innovation.

Also, the competences of the workforce are considered one of the more salient predictors of ECEC quality. Based on the opinion of Slovak Commitee of the World organization for Early childhood Education, reviewing new State educational programme for pre-schools in Slovakia, 2015, there is a discrepancy in the number of performance standards in different educational areas, while more emphasise is put on mathematics and processing of information (47) than e.g. on health and physical movement of children (13). Therefore, the more balanced approach is recommended. Concrete educational programmes or relevant materials for teachers, supporting the elimination of this discrepancy, however, are currently missing. The need for relevant training programmes, focused on outdoor education, was clearly defined and confirmed also by the Slovak pre-school teachers,  participants of the online research, in February 2016.Through this research, with 326 respondents, 286 - 88% of the total number, expressed their interest in new training materials and resources for outdoor activities. The situation with integrating the outdoor approach in ECEC, differs in European countries greatly. The idea of using this approach, originated in Scandinavia in the 50ties, is nowadays practiced in many European countries, e.g. SE, DK, UK, DE, CZ and other. So called \u201eForest schools\u201c, based on this approach, providing alternative to mainstream education, are well established in the UK (over 300 schools). Few of them can be found in CZ (120), where they were officialy recognized by the law in March 2016.  Very few can be found in Slovakia, too (less than 10). In Denmark, it is common to integrate the aspects of the Forest school approach, into the regular pre-school environment, linking it to official curricula. Research in the UK and Scandinavia, as well as all the other countries, where outdoor education is commonly used in ECEC as a mainstream education approach, or integrated into the mainstream, shows following benefits of this approach on child\u00b4s development: - Increase of self-confidence and self-belief- Development in social skills and awareness of their actions on others- Increased language and communication skills- A keenness to participate \u2014 motivation and concentration- Improved stamina and gross and fine motor skills- Development of respect for and interest in the natural environment- Increased health and overall wellbeing  of childrenBased on these proved benefits, the project focuses on:- transfering of verified ECEC teaching methodology, built on outdoor education concept, originated in and inspired by Scandinavian educational traditions,  nowadays used in the UK and other European countries, to countries, where this concept is less used and underdeveloped;  - adapting this methodology for the use in the public pre-schools to make it accessible for as many ECEC teachers, and, at the same time, reaching as many children as possible, in all 4 project countries (SK, UK, DK, EE)- through developing project outputs: O1/Handbook for the pre - school teacher on outdoor education, O2/ Online training modules, O3/ Standards of the outdoor teacher and O4/ Ideas for outdoor activities - fostering the skills of pre-school teachers on outdoor education, supporting their implementation of outdoor education approach in practice- developing additional motivational tools for teachers e.g. International OUTDOOR TEACHER award, to encourage the use and implementation of this approach - to support international cooperation in ECEC and developing new thematic network focused on outdoor education, including pre-schools, public and private institutions, NGOs, Universities and VET schools, supporting the use of new teaching approaches and sharing of best practices in the sector of Early Childhood Education and Care on European levelIn order to achieve project objectives, all together 6 partners, 3 from Slovakia (2 NGOs and University, focused on informal or formal education), one from UK (educational institution), Estonia and Denmark (kindergartens with outdoor approach quite differently integrated) will be involved in the partnership.

In contrast, in the UK and Germany school grounds are being developed for greater use by their pupils and staff, through building small and creative places with educational objects, instead of eventless and cheerless school grounds.\r\n\r\nIn the research, carried out in February 2017, 99% of responders expressed their interest for learning outside as an innovative way for learning, 96% welcome the opportunity of transforming their school grounds for better learning place and 92% express their willingness to participate on project activities focused on transforming the spaces for better outside learning.\r\n\r\nIn response to the above needs, the project focuses on combining already existing A) methodology for outside learning activities while using the school grounds and its elements from UK, B) skills and knowledge about transforming the spaces for better learning from DE, as well as C) training structure for designing the places with focus on the process of transformation from SK, with the aim to build complex training programme, missing nowadays in SK, UK or DE, to lead participants:\r\n- To transform their school grounds or nearby public places for better outside learning\r\n- To motivate teachers to take their everyday learning outside \r\n- To offer the ideas for outside learning activities\r\n- To support teachers` confidence in application of new methods of outside teaching and learning\r\n- To be able to propose proper outside learning activity while using the elements from school grounds and public places\r\n- To be more active in society\r\n- To gain skills of project partners in specific field of complex planning the re-design of spaces for outside learning\r\n- The last, but not least, foster quality improvements, and innovation excellence at the level of education and training institutions, in particular through enhanced transnational cooperation between education and training providers\r\n\r\nThese GENERAL OBJECTIVES of the project and OVERALL PROJECT GOAL aimed at \u201cSupporting the skills of teachers for transforming the spaces for outside learning\u201d will be reached through development of 4 project outputs: O1/HANDBOOK for transforming spaces for learning activities, O2/ONLINE GUIDE for re-design of school grounds and public places, O3/IDEAS FOR DESIGNS of school grounds and public places, and O4/INSPIRATIONS FOR LEARNING ACTIVITIES using re-designed grounds, which will all together provide a complex training material.\r\n\r\nThe direct target groups of proposed project CHANGE THE GROUNDS are project partners and teachers from primary schools in SK, UK, and DE. Partnership plans to implement following activities, while addressing project target groups and concrete participants:\r\n- RE-DESIGNING AND TRANSFORMING THE SPACES FOR LEARNING ACTIVITIES (O3) involving 12 teachers \r\n- TRAINING EVENT, involving 21 participants \u2013 teachers and partners institutions\r\n- INSPIRATIONS FOR OUTSIDE LEARNING ACTIVITIES, proposed by teachers (O4)\r\nthrough implementation of gained knowledge and increased skills from O1/HANDBOOK and O2/ONLINE GUIDE.\r\nOther project events, conferences, will be opened to any interested teachers, workers with children, school leaders as well as students of teaching professions in all the partner countries.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve objectives, all together 4 partners, 2 NGOs from SK (Strom zivota and INAK) and educational institutions from UK (Learning Through Landscapes) and DE (Green League), all active in education and training, will be involved in the partnership. We believe the expertise of above institutions will contribute to development of strong network, leading to successful fulfillment of project objectives, with developing bases of future long - term cooperation for the benefit of all involved. Project outputs, developed in the project, have the potential to positively influence large group of teachers and strengthen their skills for transforming the spaces for outside learning, while enhancing the overall  quality of learning environment.", "http://www.ltl.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SK01-KA201-035316_2"]]}}, "6JJ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "New Media - New Methods: teaching and learning in the digital age", "The Henry Beaufort School", 119782.0, 5, 5, "Most pupils at our schools use mobile devices and modern media outside school all day, every day. But they are often blind to the risks involved. Neither do they realise the full potential of these devices for learning: most probably see the main purposes of these devices to be a) for keeping in contact with \u201cfriends\u201d and b) for playing games. However, we are convinced that the mobile devices in our pupils' pockets and the computers in our classrooms and homes can be put to much better use for teaching and learning. \r\n\r\nMany teachers at our schools are very cautious in their use of digital technology in lessons and do not take advantage of the many opportunities the digital age brings into the classroom, often because because they feel unqualified to do so. The main  aims of our project are a) to train the staff in our schools to make the most of digital technology in their lessons, thereby enhancing the use of ICT in the teaching / learning process and increasing the quality of education and b) to educate our pupils to use digital technology safely and discover the potential their devices offer for learning, using innovative and learner-centered pedagogical approaches thereby developing their digital skills as well as their basic skills.\r\n\r\nWe realised in our current project that each of our schools has experience in a different field of digital technology. The English partner has a well equipped media suite for filming, photography, green-screen, stop-motion and digital editing; the German school uses mobile devices for teahcing and learning; the Finish school uses eBooks and materials; the Spanish school uses Moodle as a virtual learning environment; the Italian school has begun to teach coding. We plan to exchange examples of best practice with our European partners, placing the emphasis on different areas each term. Through blended learning, our pupils will work together online putting the the methods learnt into practice. Each phase will culminate in an international meeting at which staff will be trained by their hosts in their specialised area and the pupils will work in international teams, teaching their partners and putting the newly learned skill into practise. \r\n\r\nThe main topics of our project will be: digital citizenship; digital multi-media film productions; the use of mobile devices, the creation and use of interactive eBooks, the creation and use of courses for learning platforms. We will test modern, learner-centred techniques such as flipping the classroom, blended learning and project-based learning and encourage our pupils to take more responsibility for their own learning. Throughout the project, the emphasis will be how these elements can improve teaching and learning , so as to better meet the needs of individual pupils, increase their motivation and improve their basic skills. \r\n\r\nWe plan to visit each of the five partner schools once during the project with a team of around 40 visiting pupils and  staff. They will work together to teach and learn from their partners. Four transnational project meetings for staff will allow for planning and evaluation as well as providing time for staff training for the upcoming activities. A final visit to England will provide an opportunity to share examples of best practice in all areas covered. Throughout the project we will use eTwinning and the Twinspce to  collect our work and document our project as well as for online collaboration. The website will contain examples of best practice from all areas covered and lists of tools and methods used. \r\n\r\nThe project will bring benefits that could not be achieved without the element of European collaboration: A reduction of prejudice against other languages and nationalities by getting to know international students; opportunities to travel, become more independent and self-confident by visiting or hosting partners; Improved social skills, intercultural skills and life skills through being hosts and guests and through working together. Pupils will experience and embrace differences, make new experiences by participating in activities and visits. This will also improve their language skills.  For the teachers the visits enable them to receive an unprecedented view into the school systems, methods and traditions in other countries which will broaden their horizons and motivate them to re-think their own practices. The visits will improve their language skills and their teaching skills in the area of digital media. \r\n\r\nWe expect this project to contribute to changing the way our pupils see and use their phones and computers and to making them more responsible digital citizens. We expect it to change the way the staff at our schools use modern media. They will aquire knowledge and experience in using computers and mobile devices as a way to make lessons more learner-centred and learners more independant.", "http://www.beaufort.hants.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE03-KA219-013805_2"], [2015, "Individuelle F\u00f6rderung an der  Nelson-Mandela-Schule", "The Henry Beaufort School", 2276.0, 3, 3, "Our school is a comprehensive school in a rural area with around 1000 pupils. THe words and actions of our patron Nelson Mandela influence our school life, and as an ASP-Net Unesco School ( and European School) we have a long tradition of european connections and exchanges. Therefore it is important to us that our staff do not lose sight of that European dimension. \r\n\r\nSince the middle school merged with the third-tier school on our site four years ago we are experiencing a far higher intake of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, with migrant backgrounds and with special educational needsNext year we are to become a school where pupils with physical, emotional or learning disabilities will be integrated into the system. An external evaluation last year showd that differentiation and meeting the needs of individual students the area is which is most in need of developmentat our school. For this reason, a new development plan is being put into place to address these problems. Our goal is to improve the cometencies of our staff and equip them methodically and didactically to meet the needs of individual students in diverse classes. Therefore we plan to send two colleagues from different departments - languages, maths, science, humanities - and staff with special responisbilities in these areas to training courses.  We plan to cover many subject areas and involve experienced and less experienced colleagues. in order to ensure that the results will be effectively trasferred back into all areas of the school. In order to gather impressions on a whole-school level we plan to send members of the leadership team to obsereve at our partner schools in England and Italy, for whom diversitiy and inclusion is an everyday topic. \r\n\r\nAnother specialist area at our school is the use of modern media. A small, motivated team is behind this work. We are well equipped and have a number of sets of mobile devices as well as classes using iPads 1:1. This team needs to gather experience from other countries, as school in other parts of Europe are more advanced in  this field. The team trains further staff both within our school and throughout our region and would benefit from new opportunities. Developments in this area will also help us to improve the way we cater for individual needs in lessons. \r\n\r\nIn the long term we expect the project to improve the abilities of our staff to meet the needs of individual students as well as extending the European dimension of our school as a whole.", "http://www.beaufort.hants.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE03-KA101-013441_1"]]}}}}
