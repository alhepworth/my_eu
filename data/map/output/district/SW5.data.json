The music will be characterized as a glue and an element of social solidarity and a fundamental tool of social inclusion. Music as high artistic expression is experienced in all its many forms. The young participants in the youth exchange will experience various activities conducted with no formal work methodology, will explore together their knowledge and musical styles and experience in a final performance, the creation of new music, from text to music. The sounds, the music will reflect the diverse cultural influences and traditional European countries involved in youth exchange. The music is used by young people as a reflection of their lifestyle, way of dressing, their thoughts, how to be, to express themselves and their culture. Participants will be involved in debates and discussions, workshops and other group activities to discover the similarities and differences of the common influences in the musical traditions of different European cultures. They will also examine the role that music has played and in today's society as a whole, creating trends and lifestyles, and how through the words you can send a message, giving the opportunity to express their personality and their views. The music will serve as a starting point for a more detailed discussion of the social problems that young people experience today, creating a hope. This young people, during the week, they will feel as a family try to find solution to their problems and they will be inspired to create further initiative like this to improve their European society. Their culture and skills will fuse making them feeling of a big community: Europe.\r\n\r\nProject activities are aimed at involving young people through active participation, which is a priority in the \"Erasmus +\".
