Creating a book trailer involves the use of media in didactics, has a strong educational value and uses the methodologies of learning by doing and learning among peers. \r\nThis kind of didactics is not  purely disciplinary, but is mainly subject to the formation of the person and his needs, centered on laboratories techniques and very attractive, which works starting by problems and aims at their solution with the cooperation and sharing  of all.\r\n We decided to use booktrailers in order to stimulate the students to read.\r\nThe partnership is made up of 6 partner schools (Greece, Italy, Latvia, Romania, Spain, Uk), which have developed in the past successful collaborations. They belong to similar segments of education ranging students from 6 to15 years old in the various countries. Each school has classes with children with disabilities and/or disadvantages of various kinds and will be involved in the activities of the project. \r\n. The partners share materials and resources, and develop units of cross-curricular\r\nwork in literacy, and production of booktrailers that are tested/implemented in primary and secondary schools.

The need for having to explain themselves through a different language bring them to learn different reading codes.\r\nThe desired impact at local and regional level: is the development - through an international event such as MEET Festival -  of a new approach and a new relationship between young people and the world of culture and cinema. On these international festivals young people will be given the opportunity to catch their territory to be better known and appreciated in Europe through films made by the students themselves and by professional film makers during the festival. \r\nWe envisage to reach the project objectives also beyond regional, national and European level.\r\nWe want to give  participants the opportunity to experiment new pathways of improving their knowledge and competences. We expect young people and adults involved in the project to widen their mental boundaries and look at their everyday life through a new perspective, with an increased European consciousness, feeling of being part of the Community both in individual or communal levels.

Nowadays, being increasingly employed as a pedagogical tool in formal and non-formal contexts, issues of quality in mobility become a pressing concern. Although considered quite important it is very difficult to pin down precisely what good quality in mobility actually means. Here comes the correlation between quality and quantity: the more is known about quality and how to achieve it, the more confident and effective organizations can be in their efforts to reach out and offer mobility experience as a meaningful opportunity for strengthening future employability and personal development.\r\n\r\nAccording to EC Mobility Scoreboard that monitors progress in IVET mobility based on 10 key action areas, the average EU performance for 2016 in terms of ensuring mobility quality is considered unsatisfactory. As regards partners, only Lithuania and Italy performed very good in mobility quality, followed by Germany and UK classified as performing good, and last in the ranking are Bulgaria and Portugal with no data provided. \r\n\r\nGiven this conceptual problem and relying on EP Resolution of 12 Apr 2016 on Erasmus+ and other tools to foster mobility in VET, STAYMOBIL concept was prompted by the importance of:\r\n+a common European education area grounded in a strong mobility component for developing stronger European identity and enhanced citizenship\r\n+improving VET mobility programmes so as to deliver added value for all participants as regards qualifications, recognition and content\r\n+improving social responsibility (SR) skills as part of mobility learning outcomes. \r\n\r\nThus, STAYMOBIL project sets the overall aim to improve quality assurance in transnational VET mobility through socially responsible behavior of all VET mobility actors, thus promoting and further developing quality in mobility and sustaining learning outcomes. \r\n\r\nSpecific objectives\r\n~to provide mobility organizers with an innovative framework to assess, monitor and promote QA and sustainability at all stages of VET mobility\r\n~to foster mobility organizers to verify and continuously improve quality of mobility activities through the development of a new to date practical approach for self-audit\r\n~to enhance applicability and facilitate transferability of the project innovative approach through the provision of a set of recommendations, strategies and good implementation practices\r\n~to enable mobility users to assess their SR performance as essential part of learning outcomes, thus increasing broad awareness of good ethical and socially impeccable behaviour during mobility.\r\n\r\nProject is aimed primary at: \r\n1.Mobility organisers: \r\n+VET institutions, sending and/ or receiving VET learners and staff\r\n+Intermediary organizations involved in mobility\r\n+Companies providing mobility placements\r\n2.Mobility users\r\n+VET learners (apprentices and VET students) \r\n+VET staff (teachers, trainers, etc.) \r\n3.VET policy makers at national and EU levels.\r\n\r\nWithin project lifetime 4 IOs will be developed: \r\n1.Reference Framework for Sustainable Transnational VET Mobility setting up a series of quality indicators to assess, monitor and promote QA and sustainability at all mobility stages.\r\n2.Practice Kit aiming to verify, assess and improve the quality of activities provided at all mobility stages based on O1 quality indicators matrix.

Europe is becoming more and more popular tourist destination, commanding a market share of the world tourism industry bigger than 40%. Along with this positive economic impact, however, tourism puts a significant strain on European natural environments and socio-cultural authenticity.  \r\n\r\nMany initiatives have been undertaken in the EU to raise public awareness of sustainability and to ensure sustainable management of tourist destinations, businesses and products. Numerous Europe-wide reports, however, prove that the workforce employed in the sector still lacks the right, green skill set for implementing principles of sustainable development.\r\n\r\nTourism sector in Europe is dominated by micro and small enterprises (MSEs), which often have lack of resources to invest either in sustainable practices or in workforce skills development. At the same time, many sustainable tourism practices have already proven their economic viability to micro and small enterprises. Moreover, affordability and cost efficiency of such practices increase significantly, if MSEs create clusters and combine efforts to implement them.\r\n\r\nThe Sustain-T project, therefore, aims to enhance the sustainability performance of EU micro and small enterprises in the tourism sector by raising their managers\u2019 awareness of sustainable tourism practices and improving their networking and collaboration skills for establishing new green alliances and implementing joint sustainability initiatives.\r\n\r\nProject\u2019s specific objectives are:\r\n1. Develop an on-line training package, addressing challenges tourism MSEs face in transforming their business model towards sustainability;\r\n2. Create interactive tools, facilitating collaboration of tourism MSEs in developing joint sustainability initiatives;\r\n3. Provide tourism MSEs with an open educational resource - an interactive learning platform containing all Sustain-T training material;\r\n4. Deliver guidelines for MSEs and for VET providers on using the developed materials and resources in their practice.\r\n\r\nThe project utilises life-cycle methodology, which implies a sequence of activities for planning, executing and disseminating the project results.

Innovation has been placed in the centre of Europe 2020 strategy for its key role in business expansion, employment creation and economic growth.Innovation Union Scoreboard (2015) states that EU innovation growth has been increasing at an average annual rate of 1.0% between 2007 and 2014. Still, the growth has not been equally strong across all innovation dimensions and indicators. While Europe has been getting stronger in Innovation Enablers and Firm Activities, a notable decline in EU SMEs\u2019 Innovation Outputs has occurred. The share of SMEs with product/process innovations has shrunk by 1.7% and that of the marketing/organizational innovations by 3.3%. Sales of innovative products have declined by 0.8%. The discrepancy between innovation inputs (enablers and firm activities) and innovation outputs proves that Europe still has to tap into its innovative potential and is yet to poise itself better to be able to fully cash in on its innovative products and services.Commercialization of innovation is becoming an urgent problem. The most recent Innobarometer survey (2015) confirms EU SMEs experience difficulties in bringing innovative products or services to market. It also states that SMEs face more constrains to commercialization of their innovations than bigger companies. Lack of marketing expertise has been a problem in commercializing innovations for 39% of SMEs, compared to 23% of bigger enterprises.Among SMEs, young firms (0-5 years old) have the highest potential for innovation, growth and jobs creation (DynEmp, OECD). At the same time, they represent the most vulnerable group due to:1. low survival rate \u2013 in a majority of EU Member States only 40% to 60% of firms born in 2008 survived until 2012 (Annual Report on European SMEs 2014/2015);2. shortage of skills related to planning and managing innovation process and bringing innovative ideas to market (same as above).The data analysis reveals a need for training which will provide young SMEs with fail-safe methods of introducing innovative products/services to market and gaining commercial success. The INN-COMMERCE project addresses this challenge setting up the aim: to foster commercialization of young SMEs' innovation by improving their knowledge and skills in promoting and marketing innovative products or services through gamified training, specifically tailored to their needs.Specific objectives include:- Developing curriculum and e-learning content addressing the challenges young SMEs face in commercialization of innovative products/services;- Providing young SMEs with an open educational resource complete with learning materials on the innovation process with special focus on commercialization of innovation;  - Delivering clear guidelines for young SMEs and C-VET institutions on using the developed materials and resources in their practice;- Collecting SMEs\u2019 best practices in applying marketing strategies for successful commercialization of innovative products and services.The project employs life-cycle methodology, which implies a sequence of activities for planning, executing and disseminating the project results. In the lifetime of the project, the following intellectual outputs will be developed:O1. Course curriculum and learning content including a) presentations supplemented with voice memos and b) game-like exercisesO2. Gamification strategy and interactive/ gamified content implemented on the e-learning platformO3. Guidelines for SMEs and VET providers explaining the nature of INN-COMMERCE trainingO4.

Learning mobility, that is transnational mobility for the purpose of acquiring new skills, is one of the fundamental ways through which individuals, particularly young people, can strengthen their future employability as well as their personal development (European Commission 2009).\r\n\r\nThe success of the placements abroad depends a lot on the extent to which the trainee gets in contact with the lifestyle, mindset and habits of the hosting country. In this process that is both personal and intercultural for trainees, the role of hosting organisations is central. SMEs represent the trainee\u2019s \u201cpractical handbook\u201d in the world of work and also for the country\u2019s identity and environment (economic, social and cultural).

On the one hand there are SMEs and similar organizations hosting mobilities, intermediaries facilitating EU mobilities and EU mobilities sending organizations. In other words the three sides of the process will be approached, their viewpoints considered and their observations and recommendations will be embedded in the learning materials. The aim is that each of these three types of actors is satisfied with the final products and sees value in adopting the materials for building intercultural competence. Knowing that all involved possess the necessary intercultural competence will bring more trust in their partnership and will facilitate cooperation. All these actors will be involved at different stages of InterMobil implementation \u2013 in the research phase, focus groups discussions, prototype workshops and small-scale events organized by the partners. Thus all of them will be given a voice and a chance to contribute to the development of the products. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes\r\n\r\nThe project will result in three intellectual outputs:\r\n\r\n~ Learning content on intercultural competence \u2013 partners will apply a culture general approach, which is not focusing on specific cultures but on developing intercultural competences, which can be used in any environment.

As our college is only about 3 km away from the Dutch border, the focus of our school programme has always been on internationalisation.\r\n\r\nOur aim is not only to prepare students to be able to live and work in the Euregio region, but also to pave their way for an increasingly global job market. Preparing them for the job market, however, is not our only goal. With the work placements we want to give them the chance to gain positive experiences with people from other countries and cultures. In our opinion, an understanding between people from different nations can grow best if people actually meet. Also, having yourself experienced what it is like to be a \u201cforeigner\u201d in another country, will help you approach people without prejudices in future.\r\n\r\nThe project \u201cFirst vocational experiences in Europe\u201d is based on these considerations.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at two target groups. On the one hand there is a group of 152 students from the full-time initial vocational training and on the other hand there are 18 trainees from the dual system (taught at college for 1 \u00bd days and at a company for 3 \u00bd days). In the next two years 140 of the participants of the full-time initial training at our college will take part in the additional vocational qualification \u201ceuregio competence\u201d. In 2004 this additional vocational qualification has been developed together with the 5 partner regions in the Euregio Maas - Rhine region and has been offered to the students with great success. It consists of 4 competencies: language competence (the students choose either French or Dutch as a second language), information competence (course: Living and working in the Euregio Maas- Rhine region), intercultural competences (one focus of the language courses) and a work experience in the region, the students are learning the language of. If the students have successfully passed all the segments and successfully passed an additional language test they will be rewarded with the Euregio competence certificate, which is accepted in all partner regions.\r\n\r\nThe other 12 students of the full-time vocational college will do their work placements in England, Spain or France apart from the above mentioned additional qualification.\r\n\r\nFurthermore there will be 18 participants from the dual system (trainees). They will do work placements in England.\r\n\r\nAll these activities are aiming at consolidating and extending their language skills, at acquiring a larger intercultural competence, as well as getting insights into the world of work and the social structure of their host countries.\r\n\r\nThe work placements of our college in the Euregio region will be organized by our school. We will find accommodation for the students. Our partners in Belgium and the Netherlands will help us find work placements and together with the students we will choose the most suitable for them. We will also take care of the students during their work placements. Our colleagues will meet the students during their time abroad. Usually at the end of their work placements they will see them in their companies.\r\n\r\nApart from that they can be reached by email or telephone any time. The vicinity of the work placements and the commitment of the teachers involved have enabled us to take good care of the students so far.\r\n\r\nTo implement and supervise the work experience in countries which are further away needs more support by our local partners.

First and foremost we have seen more self-confidence as they have coped with the demands of their work experience on their own. For many of them it is the first time that they have to organize their daily routine by themselves and in foreign surroundings. After successfully coping with this they are rightfully proud of themselves. They have gained this experience for their future and this effect we can immediately notice at our school.\r\n\r\nWhen the students are coming back from their work experience and are talking about their experiences they are the best advertisements for the project.

This Euregio offers a lot of qualified workplaces but you need the linguistic and intercultural qualifications. To prepare jong people for this special job market, the additional vocational qualification \u201eEuregio-Competence\u201c has been developed in 2004. At the Vocational College Herzogenrath the learners can follow this qualification since that time and it is very successful. About 40 students receive this qualification every year.But this doesn\u00b4t only enable them fort he euregional job market, it also is a plus for their application on the German  labour market. A lot of companies work together with cross-border companies in the Netherlands or Belgium. And also the students have proved that they are motivated to do more than only the necessary things.But it\u00b4s not only the euregional job market we prepare the students for,  they should also get first, possibly good experiences with people in different countries. Because the progamme includes vocational internships abroard, they can make those experiences.The Vocational Colleges from J\u00fclich, D\u00fcren and Eschweiler were impressed on \u201eEuregio-Competence\u201c and choose it to start an internationalization strategy at their schools.The connection between the Ludwig-Erhard-College Bonn and the project manager is based on the cooperation in the context of Europeanactivities together with the EU-Gesch\u00e4ftsstelle in the Cologne region. Both schools want to start the additional qualification \u201eEuropakaufmann\u201c in the dual system and so it seemed to be reasonable to us to work together. This qualification includes an internship as well.We can exchange experiences, share the work and motivate each other.With this project we reach 147 students in the school based training and 32 in the dual system.Those yong people will test and expand their language skills and make experiences in the new work environment during their 2 \u2013 8 weeks lasting Internship. But they  learn something about a different way of working and different culture, too. They will learn to organise their life on their own and to handle new and sometimes strange situations. In our experience the students normally are very impressed by the people they come to know and they are getting more open towards other cultures. They are more self-imployed and more self-confident and that has a positiv effect on their social environment.The internships in the Euregio Maas-Rine are organised and handled by the teachers themselves because the workplacements are very clos tot he Colleges. They are in close contact with the companies in the Netherlands and Belgium as well. The internships in other European countries are organised by reliable partners.The contact between students and companies then is kept via mail.In this project we also plan mobilities from teachers.

They will learn about and acquire the processes, technologies and the culture of work in the conditions of a developed European economy, improve their ability to communicate in English, especially in the field of professional terminology, and learn about the socio-cultural background of UK. The members of the staff of the intermediary organization will provide the students organizational help and they will monitor the stay. They will regularly contact the employers and host families and hold meetings with the students. The students will be supported by the accompanying teacher on their journey to Plymouth and back and during the first days of the stay. The second run to Plymouth will be realized in spring (May)- June) 2016 for nine students of the four-year branches Transport Operation and Transport Economy, Mechanic - tool setter and Mechanic of installations in buildings. The participants will spend three weeks working  for businesses acording to their branches and learn about their activities, deepen their knowledge and skills in their field of study, learn about the culture of work in terms of advanced European economies, deepen their ability to communicate in English, especially in the field of technical terminology and get familiar with the socio-cultural environment of Great Britain.

We plan mobilities to six European countries (Cyprus, Great Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy, Slovakia). We would like to extend the program and, in addition to students of chemical programs that prevail, send abroad also students of the newly taught programs at our school - Chemist of fire protection, Beauty services and students of the apprenticeship program Hairdresser. Vocational training is a means of new knowledge acquisition and practical skills gaining. A foreign vocational training has proved an invaluable experience with the different occupational and cultural environment and also a strong motivation for their further learning. It also increases the quality and the atractiveness of the vocational education. In accordance with the curricular reform internships enable the development of civic, professional and key competencies and also in practice meet the cross-cutting themes. By passing through the language preparation and then the very internships students will improve their language portfolio. They will enhance their communication skills and also extend the vocabulary of technical terminology. The great benefits we also see in the possibility to learn the demands put on their profession, recognize learning opportunities and employability on the European labor market. The practices will be conducted at workplaces of chemical or pharmaceutical companies or in laboratories or at educational institutions (secondary vocational schools of a similar kind, technical colleges).\r\nIn case of Italy, Germany and Slovakia the mutual exchanges are planned. The partner schools in these countries as well as our school are members of CREDCHEM Network. Under this arrangement we collaborate in the implementation, development and experimental validation of the European Credit system of vocational education ECVET for chemical sector.\r\nStudents of the branch Chemist of fire will undergo the practical training at the vocational school in \u017dilina, that disposes of an excellent technical background in the field of fire fighting equipment.\r\nStudents of branches Beauty services and Hairdresser will get training in cosmetic and hairdressing salons of a vocational school in Bratislava. These internships are mutual as well.\r\nAll internships will be certified with document Europass-Mobility and will be validated as an integral part of the educational cycle.\r\n\r\nVET staff development:\r\nIn recent years, vocational education records significant changes for example in the structure of fields of study, in technology of education, in using new teaching resources and devices, in composition of students, it must face little interest of students in studying technical and scientific fields. These changes put greater demands on teachers of vocational subjects and laboratories, teachers must more intensively watch the news in their field, work with new technologies supporting teaching, cooperate with teacheers of another subjects, namely maths. The need for the project comes also from the lack of foreign experience which teachers should have, from the need to improve their language and professional skills, from the need to enhance attractiveness of vocational education, increase quality and inovation of teaching and prepare graduates for needs of national and european labour market.\r\nThe aim of the project is to initiate personal and professional development of teachers and a transfer of new trends in vocational education. We want to achieve this by enabling our teachers of vocational subjects internships in four EU countries where teachers will gain new experiences with vocational training in schools of similar focus, gain new ideas and examples of how to use modern teaching tools and methods based particularly on ICT.

Activities will directly address targets set out in the Europe 2020 strategy to promote youth, employability of young people, lifelong learning, the countering of social exclusion and the promotion of active citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe theme, \u201cOcean Citizens of the Future, has been selected because Plymouth and Brest are both experts in the maritime field and the project focuses on the integration of this environment into the social and economic well-being of both cities, while raising the awareness of their citizens to well qualified jobs and recruitment opportunities within the maritime sector. This fits in well with current major developments to reinvigorate the regions\u2019 marine and advanced manufacturing sectors, significantly increasing job opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe partnership will be coordinated by the two regional education authorities, working closely with eight schools, covering a range of demographic profiles from socially deprived to more economically-advantaged across the whole age range i.e. 3 \u2013 18 years. Teachers in these schools have already been involved in extensive project planning, designed to make the fullest possible use of the outstanding coastal environments, as well as contacts with local businesses and industries accessible to the partner schools in both countries, including tourism, commerce, port industries and military bases. \r\n\r\nThe schools and education authorities will work together with other key organisations with international reach, including Brest'Aim -Oc\u00e9anopolis in Brest and the UK\u2019s National Maritime Aquarium (NMA) in Plymouth. Both have major roles in research and educational provision and will play a strategic part in project support, multiplier events and dissemination of results. Other more local groups and small scale organisations with entrepreneurial approaches likely to appeal to young people will also be involved. Both cities have a vibrant range of major cultural activities and events which draw on the cities\u2019 maritime histories and environments. These will be fully integrated into opportunities for all involved in the project i.e. 5000 +.\r\n\r\nShared collaborative activities will bring an added value to the competences of the partners through meeting clearly identified needs of young people, who need support and encouragement to appreciate and develop the skills needed to succeed in the wider environment of today\u2019s Europe.\r\n\r\nEcological, economic and social challenges for the regions will be explored in ways designed to generate real impact and meaning for students, teachers and the wider communities.  Ocean Citizens of the Future will encourage the young people involved to appreciate and interact with ecological and environmental issues within their shared European environment, through their joint international activities, communication and integrated mobilities. This will encourage them to become more proactive citizens with a heightened development of initiative and increased language skills.\r\n\r\nProject results will include:\r\nYoung Reporters of Arts and Sciences .
