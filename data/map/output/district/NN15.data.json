The school employs 70 members of staff and lies at the heart of the Ise Lodge housing estate (one of the largest housing estates in Britain).  Many of our children had parents and grand parents that have all been through the school.  A very large proportion of pupils are of White British heritage. The proportion of pupils from minority ethnic backgrounds is below average. Very few have English as an additional language.  We have recently noticed an increased number of vulnerable pupils at the school and those for whom safeguarding is an important issue.\r\n\r\nOur team a school is relatively new and strive to develop to ensure we make an impact through the learning and activities we provide. We have began our global development by registered for the Global Learning Programme with a local school as we realise that this is an area that is lacking and an experience the school must have to be successful.   \r\n\r\nTherefore, our project main objectives are:\r\n\r\nTo develop leadership across the school through the observation of best practice across Europe.\r\nTo develop the skills and expertise of teachers so that they can deliver first quality teaching to all children.\r\nTo increase knowledge and understanding of various ICT tools and increase competencies in classroom practice.\r\nTo develop and enhance teaching and learning through methods to address learners self confidence, motivation and appreciation of their own skills and abilities.\r\nTo ensure that each school's curriculum is exciting and innovative and has an element of globalisation and internationalism and enhances the learning of the children.\r\nTo develop the skills and expertise of teachers so that they can meet the demands and expectations and deliver a first class education to all children.\r\nTo ensure children are prepared for the global dimension that is the nature of the world today and have a clear and sympathetic view of a variety of cultures\r\nTo develop and enhance teaching and learning methods and application in ICT, visual literacy, SEN practice and wellbeing.\r\nTo further enhance and develop leadership to support capacity in our middle and senior leadership, which will in turn support and facilitate the dissemination of successful strategies gleaned from our international development courses.\r\nEstablish links to develop partnership projects.\r\nEnhance teaching and learning through sharing of good practice and experiences with schools across a number of countries.\r\n\r\nWe aim to achieve our objectives by staff attending structured training courses in 3 countries Italy, Iceland and Spain.  A total of 12 teaching and non teaching staff will take part in these training which included structured sessions as well and visit to schools and cultural activities. Staff have been selected based on their role, experience and willingness to share and implement changes in our school.\r\n\r\nThe project will have elements of high quality training, developing teacher competencies, creating cross-school groups tackling similar issues as well as a forum to discuss innovative practice and share these innovations across many more schools. It will enable a forum for discussion and an opportunity for school-led research, particularly around the aspects of leadership and mental health.\r\n\r\nThe project should have maximum impact in that it meets the needs not only for our school but also for the alliance as a whole. It is innovative in that the objectives and the priorities have been established taking into account our role in the alliance and have been chosen to match the needs of the school. It also provides a wonderful opportunity to cascade and disseminate results through a ready set up system which is the teaching school alliance.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the project, we should have a curriculum and methodology that creates consistency within and across schools and develops teacher competency in teaching; a system of SEN provision that is led by a strong philosophy and underpinned by great practice which is crucial to successful schools; children who are well-balanced and have training in stress and anxiety relief and a school that has knowledge and expertise to deal with children and families in crisis. All of this development will be led by a team of teachers who have a strong vision and awareness of what needs to be achieved and how change can be managed and sustained. This will have a long term impact on the experiences of our children and the our community.", "http://www.millbrookjuniors.co.uk", "Millbrook Junior School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035557_coordinator"]]}}, "5YT": {"cordis": {"data": [[1212278400000, 1346371200000, "Water in Industry, Fit-for-Use Sustainable Water Use in Chemical, Paper, textile and Food Industry", "Alpro UK Ltd", "'Sustainable water use in industry is the goal of AquaFit4Use, by a cross-sectorial, integrated approach. The overall objectives are: the development and implementation of new, reliable, cost-effective technologies, tools and methods for sustainable water supply, use and discharge in the main water consuming industries in order to  significantly reduce water use, mitigate environmental impact and produce and apply water qualities in accordance with industrial own specifications (fit - for - use) from all possible sources, and contributing to a far-going closure of the water cycle in a economical, sustainable and safe way while improving their product quality and process stability. The 4 pillars of the project are Industrial Water Fit-for-use, Integrated water resource management, Strong industrial participation and Cross-sectorial technologies and approach. Water fit-for-use is the basis for sustainable water use; the integrated approach a must. Tools will be developed to define and control water quality. The heart of AquaFit4Use however is the development of new cross-sectorial technologies, with a focus at biofouling and scaling prevention, the treatment of saline streams, disinfection and the removal of specific substances. By intensive co-operation between the industries, the knowledge and the technologies developed in this project will be broadly transferred and implemented. This AquaFit4Use project is based on the work of the Working group 'Water in Industry' of the EU Water Platform WSSTP; 40 % of the project partners of AquaFit4Use were involved in this working group.

A deployment platform will ascend on the wind turbine tower and deploy a work climber on the base of the blade. The climber will move on the blade by means of air-suction and carry out inspection with a shearography kit on a cantilever. The deployment platform will also act as the power and data link.\n\nOperational modeling is done by EDF, the end-users that drive this Innovation Action. Preliminary testing and validation of the market-readiness of SheaRIOS robotic application will take place at their site, both on-shore (EDF R&D) and off-shore (EDF Renewables). Three competitive small and mid-scale technology companies from three European countries will contribute so Europe will (1) integrate more wind power, (2) reduce operational costs, (3) keep the technology lead, and (4) remain a major export. As per Wind Europe, these are the targets for enabling wind to become the backbone of our electricity generation system.\n\nBased on our analysis, the non-destructive testing service provider would save 1,055\u20ac per wind turbine inspection and payback of SheaRIOS investment will be achieved after 152 inspections, or the first 2 years. The wind farm operator will save more than 1 full day per wind turbine inspection, because of the reduced inspection time, which directly translates to less revenue lost due to idle wind turbines. Finally, the cumulative savings for a period of the first 5 years will translate to \u20ac92.74m, assuming SheaRIOS will be successful in averting just 20% of the unforeseen WTB failures and contributing to increased health and safety for the rope access workers that are involved in hundreds of accidents each year.\n\n[1] Wind Europe, \u201cMaking transition work\u201d, September 2016", 414603.0, 2960655.0, 4, 7, "SheaRIOS", null, null, null, "h2020_213155_912188971"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "RENEWABLE TECHNICAL SERVICES LIMITED", 414564.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_14120"]]}}, "7PW": {"nhs": {"data": [["RP1", "St Mary's Hospital", "nhs_RP1A1"]]}}, "7RP": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Developing Research and Pedagogy", "Hall Meadow Primary School", 10505.0, 1, 1, "Hall Meadow Primary School s located on the edge of a market town in the East Midland and has been established since 2003.It now functions at full capacity with 7 single form entry classes from reception to year 6.

Through a pedagogy that attends to the needs of the whole child, the school has secured exceptionally high standards for young learners. The school also is also a lead school for the 'Inspire' teaching school alliance\" which is founded on the principle that all schools have something to offer each other. We place as much emphasis on the emotional and social wellbeing of the child, as we do on the cognitive elements of learning. This has what has enabled us to continue to be one of the most highly performing schools in the country and to work collaboratively with many other schools to share our practice. Our international schools work has enriched the curriculum  and our intention is continue to strengthen this aspect  as we move forward in developing our curriculum. As leaders in Education, we are always looking for new creative ways to enhance and develop teaching and learning. A multicultural approach will give opportunities to form links with other professionals and formulate professional dialogue. At the heart of education lies the children and any opportunity to enhance and develop their learning and their ability to think critically will be a useful tool for learning.We aims to broaden our perspective and maintain high standards both in our school and in the schools that we support and share practice with.The objectives of the project are as follows;* To develop strategies for leadership in disseminating good practice in action research and ultimately to ensure teaching and learning allows all children to demonstrate their cognitive capabilities and reach expected age related standards * To develop whole school strategies for accelerating progress in children who find access to the curriculum more challenging through use of innovation and developing depth of understanding* To enhance the teaching of mental maths to raise standards of attainment and to develop understanding of the mastery of mathsThis project is intended to inform the teaching and learning to secure the best possible outcomes for children.
