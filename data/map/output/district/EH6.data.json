It will have active users who will be champion certain updates on the site similar to an online publication or blog as well as having an internal backend where users can link together on further projects and discuss current policy and initiatives. The site will work off an ACL which stands for Access Control List, it will allow the project partners to manage the users of the site, and different groups. This will create extensive control on who can see what and who can edit or manage what. This online toolkit/site will be able to embed and host existing information available and will act as a very crucial hub and online community for youth workers, volunteers and policy makers within Europe and further afield.

As stated in the report these industries contribute to revenues of \u20ac535.9b with the creative and cultural industries (CCIs) contribute to 4.2% of Europe\u2019s GDP. The sector is its third-largest employer, after construction and food and beverage service activities, such as bars and restaurants.The project will have a significant impact on a European level by creating a pan European youth focussed programme which will further contribute to empowerment of young people to express themselves as well as further upskilling them to explore third level education thus leading them to further contribute to the growth of the music and cultural industries that exist across Europe.

We have some teachers who have done their training during the GDR times and are mainly teaching grades one to three at our primary school. Their English skills are limited, or they do not trust themselves in speaking the language in front of the pupils.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect in our school concept and guidelines is to cultivate the international contacts. Up to this point our focus was the student exchange with our partner schools. During this project we would like to focus more on the exchange of our teachers in combination with sitting in on classes in the native language and in the foreign language.\r\n\r\nOne important part is to get to know the school systems in different cultural contexts.\r\n\r\nTo reach those goals we will establish a group of teachers who will get to know the concepts of successful European schools. Their experiences and gained competences are to help us improve our school development and to also measure up against international comparisons. 18 out of around 40 teachers will attend six arrangements (Hei\u00dft das so? Oder sind das mobilities/activities?), including two courses of \u201eHow to teach English lessons for school starters\u201c and sitting in on classes in our partner schools in England and Finland, as well as at our new partner school in Scotland. We hope, that the participation in advanced trainings and the educational exchange at our partner schools will help us improve our didactic-methodical competences, our media competences, extend our repertoire in methods and teaching materials and will give us a better insight and reflection into our own teaching skills.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we are expecting to revaluate our own school concept, minimize our teachers\u2019 reservations to speak English in front of a class and to work with modern media. We also expect them to be more open-minded in terms of heterogeneity and also hope to strengthen our school profile. In addition to these aspects, we are also anticipating the professionalisation of our inclusion approach and of other aspects of our scholarship system.\r\n\r\nAfter the execution of the planned activities, we are going to evaluate whether we achieved our goals. Before the activities take place, we are defining criteria, for example \u201cIs my own need for advanced trainings fulfilled?\u201d, \u201cHow can I use my new knowledge in our school?\u201d.

In our cluster our language focus is French and Spanish.  Our aim is to immerse our children in these languages on a regular basis as part of our daily teaching. Some members of staff have been on further Spanish training to develop their skills. This is part of their Continuous Professional Development and attending the immersion course would add to that. We previously taught French and Spanish at selected stages but have now introduced Spanish to every class from Nursery to Primary 7 this session.The main objectives for our application are to improve language competencies across the school, this will allow us to meet both our school and cluster priorities, ensuring all children are immersed in Spanish from a young age. We understand the importance and benefits of exposing children to a foreign language on a daily basis as part of their classroom experience. Our project will continue to focus on using classroom vocabulary and basic language to ensure learners have a solid foundation of Spanish.

We have identified specific barriers at our schools being difficulties in transition between school levels, motivational issues, social exclusion and the lack of peer support.\r\n\r\nThere are an increasing number of pupils not reaching their potential due to motivational, transitional and exclusive issues. We want to investigate how we can reduce these barriers so that more pupils reach success in life both on a social and educational level. We believe that when empowering pupils to understand and overcome these barriers they can act as mentors and support for their peers, thus we aim to develop a functional system of peer support and co-coaching.\r\n\r\nWithin school, our primary objective is to assist pupils to perform the best of their ability, irrespective of social background or disability. Our project aims to address issues which affect all school age pupils with a specific focus on overcoming the problematic transition between school forms, countries and other issues teenagers deal with hindering them to perform in school.\r\n\r\nThe pupils involved in the programme will be aged between 16-18, and each school has agreed to hold one international meeting which will involve workshops and interaction with pupils from other countries as well as organisations and outside parties working with inclusion and motivational issues.

Each school has agreed its role in the project by taking ownership of focus areas; Scotland will focus on transitional problems, Holland will focus on motivational problems using surveys and workshops to explore present situation and identify suitable solutions and activities. Germany will focus on peer support through workshops devoted to coaching and the use of peers to engage less able pupils and Sweden will focus on integrational activities through visiting organisations working with refugees and the creation of activities meant to reduce barriers between different groups at school, e.g. refugees or pupils not yet attending national programmes.\r\n\r\nAs the aim is to fully utilise the pupil voice, another vital component of our project is to motivate and enthuse young people.

On return to their own communities the  aforementioned trainee youth workers will spend deliver a 3 week  programme delivering a sports programme to the young people within their own organisations using their new found learning and implementing  their own training . \r\n\r\nWith several   partners in the UK  we will arrange a 8 week training programme for the 24 trainee leaders who are over in Scotland as part of the youth workers training and network[ see attached programme].During their time in Scotland the participants will share ideas  and begin to co-develop a sports programme of activity that they think will be transferable to their own organisation back home and in which they could competently deliver . Each country's programme will inevitably be different due to the different needs and projects of the sending organisation however the participants will benefit from shared learning and practical experimentation as to what will work and what will be more difficult to transfer to their own organisations.  This programme will be the outcome of their own learning and will ensure that the model of peer learning is maintained with the young people passing on their new found learning to other young people. \r\nThis 3 week programme will have 2 components. The first component is to ensure skills around a particular sport is shared with the young people in the sending organisation  [ e.g skills around football or athletics or pony trekking or canoeing] The second component involves sharing basic coaching training with other young people back home who are considering coaching some of the other younger young people but who lack some of the basic skills and knowledge. This part of the programme will be open to other local youth agencies within the local area who are involved in sports  programmes with young people and will allow these organisations to capacity build their own work with young people . \r\n\r\nActivities \r\nThe activities in Scotland will be a mixture of informal learning sessions as well as visits to other sports projects , outdoor centres and  social enterprises that involve delivering sports programmes. The training is aimed to improve young peoples skills in  a wide variety of sports but including football coaching and general sports coaching  and help them develop coaching and mentoring skills which they can then use to the benefit of others that they volunteer with.

The aim is to develop knowledge exchange trips (typically of 8-10 days) that focus on the management of our natural and cultural heritage.  NET is developed around the priority areas of work within natural and cultural heritage, conservation interpretation and education in Scotland today.  Each training visit will be associated with a broad theme, which will provide a focus for activities through the week.  Emphasis will be placed on exchange of knowledge, ideas, issues and solutions between the participants and hosts. Informal talks by participants on their work in Scotland and challenges they face, as well as talks from the hosts, encouraging focused discussion on how both participants and hosts can benefit from each other\u2019s knowledge and experiences and how they can  build this into ongoing adult education courses.  \r\nAs in previous years, we will work with our partners to develop adult education training placements, which focus on new skills and knowledge and have the capacity for the exchange of best practice that fits with participants needs. For example in Germany the programme will focus on the wildcat and on preserving and managing its habitat, In Iceland the focus will be interpretive techniques for understanding and conserving the cultural landscape, including the traditional skills of turf building. In Finland and Slovakia the programme theme is forest schools and environmental education.  In Norway the themes are large mammal management, fishery management, predator control and balancing hunting and conservation interests.\r\nOur partners all  share our aim of providing high quality and innovative vocational training.

Our network of regionally based Reserve Project Officers work with local volunteers to undertake practical conservation work on these sites, protecting a diverse range of biodiversity and ensuring safe access for visitors to enjoy greenspaces and the wildlife they host.\r\n\r\nThis project will give 10 motivated and enthusiastic young people the opportunity to \"learn by doing\" by joining local volunteers to carry out conservation tasks on wildlife reserves.  The on-the-job training they will receive is non-formal and learner-centred, with activities being tailored where possible to meet their interests and needs.  The selection process has where possible identified volunteers facing fewer opportunities or obstacles in their career journey which will be addressed by participation in the project. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\n- To boost the knowledge, skills, transcultural awareness and employability of young people interested in a career in conservation by providing meaningful training and worthwhile work experience relevant to their job interests and academic background.\r\n- To support European volunteers to protect biodiversity on the Scottish Wildlife Trust's network of nature reserves and encourage them to apply the conservation skills gained in their future careers \r\n- To disseminate learning and raise awareness of the impact of volunteer involvement through a range of channels, including social media, print media and the Erasmus + Project Results Platform\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe EVS volunteers placed through this programme will be involved in protecting biodiversity on our nature reserves over a 12 month placement. They will be based at one of 4 key locations - Inverness, Castle Douglas, Dundee and Irvine (all accredited locations).  From their base, the volunteers will travel to local wildlife reserves to participate and learn through a variety in a range of activities on reserves under the supervision and guidance of the relevant Reserves Project Officer.  These activities will include woodland management, peat bog restoration, creation of wildflower meadows and footpath construction. All volunteers will also be offered the opportunity of participating in residential trips to help deliver identified conservation tasks on the Trust's more remote reserves, such as Handa Island in the North West. They will also be supported in developing a self-led project and disseminating their learning and experience in a range of ways.\r\n     \r\nWe will make all necessary pre-placement arrangements including making a formal agreement with sending organisations and arranging accommodation for volunteers.  Our qualified and experienced staff and mentors will provide a well-supported, friendly and relaxed working environment, ideal for the learning and consolidation of new skills.

The volunteers will also gain additional invaluable skills and experience, such as improved language and team-working skills and an ability to operate in a trans-cultural context.\r\n\r\nIMPACT ON ORGANISATIONS\r\n\r\nOver the duration of the project, the EVS volunteers will deliver a total of around 13,500 hours on conservation tasks on the Trust's reserves network; this time investment will achieve clear and lasting enhancements to biodiversity and access on our reserves.  They will also have completed self-led projects which enhance the Trust\u2019s learning and inform our activities and which we would not have been in a position to complete without them.  We have found that the cross-cultural liaison opportunities provided by hosting EVS volunteers work enriches the work experience for our staff as well as for volunteers from the local community.  \r\n\r\nBeing involved in this project will enhance the cross-cultural awareness and international scope of the sending organisations and increase their capacity to work in partnership.\r\n\r\nIn the longer-term, the planned wide-ranging dissemination activities in the UK and the sending countries will also raise awareness of the enormous impact and importance of the ERASMUS+ scheme and just how invaluable volunteer involvement is in the work of conservation organisations.", "http://www.swt.org.uk", "Scottish Wildlife Trust", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046374_coordinator"], [2015, "Improving Scottish Wildlife Trust Reserves", "Scottish Wildlife Trust", 41576.0, 6, 8, "The Scottish Wildlife Trust owns or manages over 120 nature reserves in Scotland.

To secure cultural sustainability in these areas, we need to strengthen the \u201ccitizen help citizen\" or \"peer to peer approach\", where civil society associations from the cross-cultural sector of amateur arts, voluntary culture, and heritage are engaged.  AIM AND OBJECTIVESThe overall aim is to improve the competences of the voluntary associations and their volunteers to provide enlivening arts and culture opportunities in the sparsely populated communities with an added value for civic and democratic participation, community bonding and local identity.The objectives are1) To develop innovative ways of outreach to citizens engaged in arts and culture to become resourceful culture volunteers.2) To develop high quality courses tailored to these groups on how to organise cultural activities with an added community value. 3) To develop the competences and skills of the voluntary associations to support volunteering and cooperation with stakeholders.   4) To develop appropriate methods to assess the involved knowledge, skills and attitudes to fulfil such demanding voluntary work.OUTLINE OF ACTIVITIESThe innovative dimension of this project is its integrated adult education approach, where we will: 1) Complete local field surveys of the current competence profiles of culture volunteering to get a baseline as well as state of the art examples for the succeeding development work;2) Develop an integrated curricula frame for culture volunteers as well as culture managers to provide enlivening cross-culture activities with added community values. 3) To design and test a series of national pilot courses for culture volunteers and managers in the varied contexts of the partner countries. 4) To design and test new Erasmus+ pilot courses for culture volunteers as well as culture managers with the aim to offer sustainable Erasmus+ training events as well as high quality national courses after the end of the project.5) To provide a Communication Portal with desk research and other supporting information about the issues of the project as well as presentations of the project\u2019s pilot work and outputs to the virtual audiences.THE PARNERSHIP CIRCLEincludes \u2022 two national umbrellas for voluntary culture: Voluntary Arts Network in United Kingdom and Cultural Councils in Denmark; \u2022 one national association for liberal adult education: The Hungarian Folk High School Society; \u2022 two organisations from the liberal adult education and NGO work, with expertise in field research and curricula planning: Foundation of Alternative Educational Initiatives in Poland, and Interfolk, institute for Civil Society from Denmark; \u2022 one public body, the Municipality of Lousada, Portugal. \u2022 Furthermore, ActKnowledge from New York will be involved in the pilot work as external evaluator to incorporate the Theory of Change methodology in the impact evaluations.

Several surveys by UN, OECD, EU and others indicate that the declining trust refers not only to the usual suspects as governments, companies and mainstream media, but also to NGOs and even more concerning to an increased distrust of other people.\r\n\r\nTrust is the fundamental element of social capital in a country, and the World Development Report (2013) shows that countries, where people are more likely to trust others, are also countries where there is less violence and more political stability, accountability and stronger economic growth.  Furthermore, trustful social relations are essential for happiness. The World Happiness Report (2012) indicates trust as one of the major reasons that some countries are happier than others.  \r\n\r\nTrust among fellow citizens is also essential for the subjective well-being or Quality of Life. Accordingly, the Eurostat Report: Quality of life in Europe \u2013 facts and views (2016) can conclude - contrary to one of the overarching aims of all EU learning and culture programmes - that the Quality of Life for the EU citizens is declining. \r\n\r\nNEED\r\nWithout trust, institutions don\u2019t work, societies falter and people lose faith in each other. Here, we think, the European sector of participatory culture (amateur arts, voluntary culture and heritage) can make a difference. This sector is, next to amateur sport, the largest civil society sector in the EU member states, and it has in the last decade been the civil society area with the highest rate of expansion in members and new associations. A vast number of voluntary and paid staff and artists are employed in a myriad of associations to provide arts and culture based activities for about 38 pct of the peoples in the member states (Eurobarometer 399, November 2013).\r\n\r\nHowever, the voluntary arts and culture associations could strengthen their societal engagement. Especially in these times, the learning providers in this sector should prioritise new initiatives that can help to counter the current decline of the cohesiveness and mutual trust in our communities.\r\n\r\nAIM AND INNOVATIVE ELEMENTS \r\nThe aim is to bridge social capital and to promote inclusion, cohesion and trust by strengthening the participatory and co-creative culture activities in the European sector of amateur arts, voluntary culture and heritage. \r\n\r\nOur development work will focus on bridging social capital in the following five contexts of culture activities and lifelong learning: inter-social, inter-generational, inter-regional, inter-cultural, and inter-European. Thereby, we intend to strengthen new participatory culture and co-creation activities, where the learning context are changed not only from individual creativity to collective creativity, but to bridge people normally outside of each other\u2019s direct social networks - not just bonding social capital between similar subgroups of individuals, but bridging former segregated social groups.\r\n\r\nKEY ACTIVITIES AND OUTPUTS \r\nThe 2-year project has four main phases: \r\n1) FOUNDING - launch the Communication Portal, English ed.  and complete a State of the Arts Survey, seven language ed. ; \r\n2) DEVELOP - compile good practice and innovative approaches and publish five Thematic Compendia, seven language ed.; \r\n3) TEST - design and test curricula by seven national pilot courses and two European pilot courses, and provide Curriculum Report, seven language ed., and design sustainable Erasmus+ training course packages; \r\n4) VALORISE - complete seven national conferences including representative foreign guests, deliver final dissemination and publish Project Summary report, English ed. \r\n\r\nIMPACT AND BENEFITS\r\nThe goals are on short term to educate the educators, to teach and engage the key staff in the huge European lifelong learning sector of participatory arts and culture to initiate new co-creative culture activities with high potential of bridging social capital. \r\nOn long term, we expect it can help to increase the mutual trust and thereby improve the quality of life for our EU citizens.\r\n\r\nWe expect the project\u2019s information provision, awareness raising as well as new possibilities for further education regarding participatory culture and co-creation will inspire the learning providers in amateur arts, voluntary culture and heritage to be more societal engaged to counter the current decline of cultural cohesion and mutual trust in our communities and to promote empowerment, togetherness, recognition, openness and inclusive participation among former segregated social groups. \r\n\r\nPARTNERSHIP CIRCLE\r\nThe partnership circle includes 8 partners from 7 countries in Northern, Eastern and Western Europe, that represent four strong national umbrellas as well as four knowledge and research centres, representing a transnational European sum of varied expertises and experiences in the field, which we cannot find in just one of the participating countries.", "http://www.voluntaryarts.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA204-034241_2"]]}}, "7EL": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Non-formal And Informal Learning and International Training IN EUROPE AGAIN", "Mackenzie School of English Ltd", 207962.0, 10, 30, "The project called \u201cNon-formal And Informal Learning and International Training IN EUROPE AGAIN\u201d, aka \u201cNAIL IT IN EUROPE AGAIN\u201d, is a development of the preceding project as regards its qualified partnerships and the proposed learning objectives, although some new points are also introduced.\r\nThe beneficiaries are in-training interns that will obtain their high school diploma (Foreign Languages School or Technical School of Chemistry, Materials and Biotechnology) corresponding to EQF Level 4 and have finished the 4th class of either school branch; among them there are immigrant students, one student with special educational needs and a high percentage of women (consistently with the recommended promotion of the values of non discrimination, social cohesion and active citizenship), for a total of 110 beneficiaries and 20 accompanying tutors. \r\nThe mobilities between 2 and 4 weeks involve a group of 27 partners in 9 E.U. countries which are representative of working and training environments tested in other LLP and Erasmus+ projects, some of them in a relationship of reciprocity. \r\nThese collaborations are varied and interesting and include private companies, Chemistry labs, public institutions, training institutions, universities, museums, hotels, kindergartens and other organizations in the fields of tourism, culture and commerce. \r\nIt has always been useful to work in synergy with organizations such as Xena (for competence monitoring), Padova City Hall, the Province administration of Padova and F\u00f2rema Confindustria for the training of the beneficiaries on the topics of private enterprise and cross competences useful for the world of work, besides helping in the dissemination of the action at a local level.  \r\nRecent school legislation concerning work experience in school curricula provides for quite a high number of compulsory hours of work experience also for the students of the 4th year. Consequently, the participation to the Erasmus+ project is even more effective in helping the school comply with the new requirements and offering the trainees an invaluable experience that might even steer the beneficiary towards specific future working/training choices. \r\nAlthough the work placement is an important stage of the process of personal growth for the participants, a good project does not confine itself to the period of work experience abroad, but preliminarily it offers preparatory activities at school that cover the whole span of the project\u2019s life. \r\nA qualifying feature of the experience is the planning and testing, rich in content and quality, of the Learning Outcomes Units inspired by the ECVET system and of the agreed upon learning objectives with tools such as the MoU and the LA, both with the traditional partners of the CREDCHEM network and with the ones of the educational and tourist fields, with the purpose of acquiring skills that can be transferred to national and international contexts. \r\nIn order to promote this good practice that can be applied in particular in the context of the Technical school of Chemistry, this year more mobilities will be reserved for the students of the Chemistry branch, consistently with the Key Objectives of ET2020 to make science and technology more appealing while improving one\u2019s language skills, strengthening creativity and innovation as key factors of a sustainable economic development. \r\nHigh quality skills and competences for employability, innovation, active citizenship and welfare, together with transparency and competence and qualification recognition, are explicitly recommended among the 6 priorities of the 2016-2020 period.  \r\nThis important goal is reached thanks to work-based learning provided by the work placements, which have the following objectives: \r\n\u2022 For the Chemistry Technical School: acquiring methodologies and procedures in the field of chemical, biological, biotechnological, environmental hygiene and healthcare analysis; interpreting results and writing reports; using instruments; performing qualitative/quantitative analysis with different methodologies;\r\n\u2022 For the Foreign Languages School: developing multilingual communicative skills in the tourist and cultural fields in hotels, tourist offices, libraries, recreation/cultural centres, universities, museums; collaborating in the organization of events, planning itineraries, managing reservations and quotes; collaborating in an educational team by planning activities relevant to the interests of the participants using one\u2019s communicative skills. \r\nThis project supports the teachers involved as tutors in a process of continuous professional development through projects of teacher mobility (ERASMUS+ CLIL O.W.Ne.R.S. 2016-1-IT02-KA101-022762); this opportunity will be taken this year by some of the tutors that have most recently joined the Erasmus+ team, to improve their teaching competence and language skills as teachers of non-language-related subjects.", "http://www.mackenzieschool.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005740_22"], [2016, "Non-formal And Informal Learning and International Training IN EUROPE", "Mackenzie School of English Ltd", 197324.0, 10, 28, "The project called \u201cNon-formal And Informal Learning and International Training IN EUROPE\u201d- NAIL IT IN EUROPE offers 105 students the possibility of a training experience abroad and it counts on the collaboration between IIS Scalcerle and bodies such as Xena (for the monitoring of competences), the town and province administrations of Padova and F\u00f2rema Confindustria (for the training of the applicants concerning entrepreneurship and the soft skills useful in the job market and for the project dissemination in the local socio-economical and manufacturing context).The foreign partners are 27 in 9 different European countries. With some of them there is reciprocity both in the Mobility program and in other LLP and Erasmus+ programs.The foreign network includes various work and/or training organizations: companies, chemical labs, public bodies, training bodies, universities, museums, hotels and others in the tourist, cultural and commercial fields.The new professions will require updated digital skills, entrepreneurship and a sense of initiative; many of the key competences for an active citizenship can be found among the objectives of NAIL IT IN EUROPE.Our ambitious aim is to highlight and promote the development of creativity and problem-solving skills in the working and entrepreneurial fields. These are soft skills that are developed also through non-formal and informal learning, which is particularly significant in the context of a work placement experience abroad managed autonomously in many ways by the beneficiaries.  On a European level, this aim cannot be reached without competence in foreign languages and a deeper awareness of European citizenship.The work placement experience is only one step along this process of growth and awareness and it needs coordinated and solid planning and implementation of preparatory activities that invade the sphere of traditional teaching and modify contents and methodology of the students\u2019 curricula.The beneficiaries of the NAIL IT IN EUROPE project are 105 students of IIS Scalcerle and other schools of the province, selected according to shared criteria which are described in the quality procedures of the school. They are trainees at their initial training stage who will get a High School or Technical School Diploma corresponding to level 4 of EQF. They have concluded the 4th year of their educational training (either the Foreign Languages course or the Chemistry, Materials and Biotechnologies technical course). Immigrant students and an elevated percentage of women are involved. The work placements will last from 2 to 4 weeks.The work placements abroad will be organized, monitored and assessed mainly by using ECVET criteria and will be meant to allow the acquisition of competencies that can be built up in time and acknowledged at a national and an international level in different contexts. With NAIL IT IN EUROPE,  Learning Outcomes and ECVET will be developed further. The content and the quality of the LO and the training objectives will be agreed upon by using tools such as the MoU and LA both with traditional CREDCHEM partners and with partners of other fields.The impact on the school and the staff that manages the project is considerable. More and more teachers have felt the need to be more informed and up to date on the topic in order to support their students more effectively in this experience. The comparison with other educational systems generates an effective cooperation also in the different subject departments, where learning objectives and curricula are updated. In a peer-education context, former trainees are involved to train the new applicants, to act as tutors and to be part of a working team that analyses the fallout and effects of the mobility experience on the future professional or educational life of the students. Besides the focus on soft skills, the project pursues the achievement of the following technical and professional skills in different fields:Chemical-biological:Learning methodologies and procedures in the fields of chemical, biological, biotechnological, environmental and sanitary analysis; interpreting results, writing reports; using instruments; performing a qualitative-quantitative analysis with different methods.Foreign languages, tourism:Developing multi-lingual communicative skills in the tourist, art and culture fields in hotels, tourist offices, libraries, leisure and cultural centres, universities, museums; helping in the organization of events promoting the cultural heritage of an area or exhibitions; planning itineraries; managing reservations and quotes.Child-care and educational services:Developing communicative skills which are not only multi-lingual but also focused on the beneficiary (nursery school children, young people in leisure centres); collaborating in an educational team; planning activities in consideration of the attention span and level of involvement of very young beneficiaries.", "http://www.mackenzieschool.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA116-004989_27"]]}}, "7JG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Language Training", "St Mary's Primary School (Leith)", 2725.0, 1, 1, "The immanent implementation of  a  dynamic new national policy called 1 + 2 languages has prompted our school to seek a mobility course to help build the skills and knowledge of teaching staff who deliver modern languages.
