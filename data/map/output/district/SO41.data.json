Stories abound of houses literally dropping into the sea and local beauty spots disappearing under the waves. In the early days valiant attempts were made to combat this problem head-on: blockades and artificial barriers were put up to prevent the sea from making further incursions inland. But, as it turned out, this just shifted the problem elsewhere. It had to be recognised that the forces driving coastal change are so powerful that it is not sustainable to resist them. \n\nSo now the policy is one of \u2018managed retreat\u2019. This, however, has several implications for Natura 2000 sites, many of which are located along the English coastline.  Ensuring that the overall ecological requirements of the Natura 2000 sites are maintained in the long term requires that losses are made good by gains elsewhere, for instance, through the re-creation of areas with similar habitats. \n\nThis LIFE project developed a strategic approach to integrating the management of flood risk with the ecological needs of Natura 2000.  This would enable the UK Government to meet the obligations of Article 6(2) of the Habitats Directive - namely to avoid deterioration of natural habitats and the habitats of species - even at the cost of losing individual sites. \nThe project was a collaborative effort between two public bodies: English Nature and the Environment Agency, operating under the guidance of an advisory group comprising nine other organisations including the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association and several conservation organisations.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=346", "http://www.english-nature.org.uk/livingwiththesea ,", "life_196"], [1999, "saline lagoons  - Conserving saline lagoons & their birds on ten Natura 2000 sites in England", "Royal Society for the Protection of Birds", 1108104.0, 554051.0, "Saline lagoons are a priority habitat under the Habitats Directive and now total just 1300 hectares within the UK.

In addition to providing a deployment function, the large space deployable structures can provide shape and stability for a spacecraft throughout its mission. Deployable structures have the capability of reducing mass substantially and also allow for a very compact storage volume during the launch phase of a mission.  To date, there is a limited number of European deployable structures being developed due to the inherit risk, cost and complexity associated with them. In addition, the conservative nature of the space industry combined with the environmental and materials challenges related to the deployment and sustainability of space structures makes the problem even more challenging. The TRL level of most deployable technologies is currently low due to this associated risk. The objective of this project is to develop 3 specific, useful and innovative large space deployable technologies: an inflatable sail structure, a deployable solar panel and a CFRP deployable boom. The aim is to develop these technologies from a current TRL of 2-3 to 6-8 within the 3 years of the proposed DEPLOYTECH project. The project addresses two key areas required for the development of critical space technologies  as described in the SPA.2011.2.2-02 call: 1. Large thin walled deployable boom and membrane structures 2. Large thin walled inflatable structures. Ground prototypes of the three deployable technologies will be developed and qualified for future flight opportunities which have already been shortlisted with industrial partners.
