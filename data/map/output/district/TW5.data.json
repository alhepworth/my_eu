I will be the participant due to my requirement to be able to teach French at KS3 competently.  Focus of the training will therefore be strongly on the language learning itself and also the rich culture of France.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of the training will hopefully be a more culturally aware, enthusiastic and knowledgeable teacher who has firsthand experience of living and interacting in the language that is then taught to students.  This will in turn mean that in the long term Heston will have language learners who are keen to immerse themselves in other cultures, willing to take up languages at AS Level and beyond and have exposure to raw and authentic material that brings their learning to life. \r\n\r\nAs an organisation Heston will become a school which has strong European links and thus open itself to a network of education and training beyond the U.K. Moreover, it can also be used as a hub for training of staff from partner schools abroad who wish to work amongst native English speakers.", "http://www.hestoncommunityschoo.uk", "HESTON COMMUNITY SCHOOL", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002215_coordinator"]]}}}}
