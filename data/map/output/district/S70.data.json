It is suggested that the more citizens find connections between their as-usual life activities and relevant policies, the more they become pro-active or motivated to be involved in the PMPs. For this reason, UbiPOL aims to provide context aware knowledge provision with regard to policy making. That is citizens using UbiPOL will be able to identify any relevant policies and other citizen's opinion whenever they want wherever they are according to their as-usual life pattern. With the platform, citizens  are expected to be more widely aware of any relevant policies and PMPs for involvement during their as-usual life therefore improved engagement and empowerment. Also, the platform will provide policy tracking functionality via a workflow engine and opinion tag concept to improve the transparency of the policy making processes. Finally, the platform enable policy makers to collect citizen opinions more efficiently as the opinions are collected as soon as they are created in the middle of citizen's usual life. UbiPOL is provides security and identity management facility to ensure only authorised citizens can have access to relevant policies according to their roles in policy making processes. The delivery of the opinion and policy data over the wireless network is secure as the platform use leading edge encryption algorithm in its communication kernels. UbiPOL is a scalable platform ensuring at least 100,000 citizens can use the system at the same time (for example, for e-Voting applications) via its well proven automatic load balancing mechanisms.

This is crucial in order for them to be able to participate in working life after completing their education. This will again probably prevent early school leaving, less unemployed young people, and all the qualities of life that reseachers have found that is related to having a job, feeling attractive in working life and being able to take care of yourself financially. \r\n\r\nSecond: In Programme for service and transportation there seems to be rather many students who strive with lack of motivation to attend this educational programme and to finish their studies. This is due to that it might be their third choice, and they would preferred to study something else, but they could not get to that program. Many of these students are less motivated for theory and may also have light learning difficulties. At the same time, this specific vocational program often is teached in a very theoretical way.  We want to make stronger connection between learning and practical training by much more use of job training from the very beginning of the first level, find a model for cooperating with and follow up learning in local businesses (and may be later, provide options for work training abroad). Thus, we want to make learning more interesting, increase learning outcomes, prevent drop-out, and help more young people to get relevant jobs.\r\n\r\nThe participants involved in this project will be 6 program teachers from the department of adapted teaching and 5 teachers from the education program for service and transport at Stend Vidareg\u00e5ande Skule. \r\n\r\nThe teachers are going to do short-term job shadowing at 3 different schools in England, Germany and Sweden, Two of them are chosen because they have worked out a good model for cooperating with local businesses, and letting the students learn while \u201cdoing a real job with real challenges\u201d. We hope to learn from them and take the knowledge home to our school. \r\n\r\nBarnsley College work with social and professional skills to qualify students for\r\nthe UK job market.They have an education programme for students with learning and behavioral disabilities, focusing on social skills for life and work management.\r\nThe development in the British labor market lies ahead of the development in Norway, especially in relation to automation and mechanization. It is therefore of great interest for us to look at how Barnsley College work with social and professional skills to qualify students for the UK job market.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results will be renewed teaching practices with better customized training, use of work-relevant tasks and more emphazise on social skills for students who need this. Hopefully long term effect will be that students  find it more motivating and easier to learn at school.

Access to information influences inclusion. However, a recent report shows that as many as 1 in 10 students leaves primary school with low literacy in NL (I. Christoffels, et al, 2016). Today\u2019s digital society offers new learning opportunities for children with literacy problems. \u201cA is for APP\u201d (APPS) unlocks these digital learning opportunities to improve literacy in struggling readers in European primary schools. The project will support and train primary school teachers to use ICT-based methodologies and reading-fluency apps in a classroom setting for the benefit of struggling readers.\r\n\r\nOur project\u2019s objectives are:\r\n(1) Define the typical characteristics of appropriate apps for reading fluency and outline how to use these apps in a diversified approach for struggling readers in the classroom. \r\n(2) Create hands on tools with and for teachers allowing them to use this knowledge in the day-to-day inclusive teaching practice.\r\n(3) Raise awareness and build an international community centred around the possibilities of literacy apps for struggling readers involving all relevant stakeholders, including app developers and policymakers.\r\n\r\nThe APPS consortium consists of 11 partners: 4 primary schools, 3 national centers for learning disabilities, and 4 universities, located in Belgium (BE), the UK, the Czech Republic (CZ), and the Netherlands (NL). The project is supported by 8 associated partners.\r\n\r\nAPPS will provide:\r\n(1) An in-depth stakeholder needs analysis identifying the needs of all relevant stakeholders concerning reading fluency in the classroom. This will be accompanied by a transferable stakeholder engagement strategy report (IO1).\r\n(2) A community building platform enabling active interaction with all stakeholders during and after the project (IO2).\r\n(3) An inventory and critical appraisal of (the characteristics of) existing reading fluency apps for BE, NL, and UK (IO3).\r\n(4) A pilot test and qualitative evaluation of 5 reading fluency apps in the primary schools in BE, NL, and UK (30 pupils per school; during 4 months) in order to choose one best app per school for further ABAB-testing (cfr. result 6).\r\n(5) Translation and adaptation, beta-testing, and dissemination of an existing reading fluency app to the Czech language (IO5) for further ABAB-testing (cfr. result 6).\r\n(6) An ABAB single-case experiment (30 pupils per school; 1 app per school; during 4 months) to evaluated the selected reading fluency apps in BE, NL, UK and CZ.\r\n(7) A toolkit for teachers in the 3 project languages (English, Dutch and Czech), offeringtips, hands-on guidelines and good practice examples of how to deliver a diversified approach in the context of app use by struggling readers in the classroom.\r\n(8) An IT literacy curriculum for struggling readers (10-11 years old), developed in close collaboration with educational policymakers (IO6).\r\n(9) Three sets of recommendations on reading fluency for teachers and parents; for national and European educational policymakers and for literacy app developers (IO7).\r\n(10) Monitoring and evaluation of changes in attitudes, confidence, competence, and reading levels of the 120 pupils throughout the 36 months.\r\n(11) Training of and together with primary school teachers on using reading fluency apps in the classroom and organising classroom practice catering for differentiation to varying levels of readers.\r\n(12) Tools and innovations available for a wide network of stakeholders through engagement activities and targeted dissemination (including 12 national multiplier events, 1 international multiplier event and the use of eTwinning).\r\n\r\nAPPS will not only analyse and evaluate several existing reading fluency apps and best teaching practices in different European countries, it will also define the typical characteristics of apps that actually work. Moreover, APPS is a collaboration of primary schools, literacy researchers, and national centers for learning disabilities across four European countries, making it possible to finally fill the theory-to-practice gap on literacy and ICT education at a European level. The IT-literacy curriculum for struggling readers (aged 10-11 years) will create the necessary framework for teachers to apply a diversified practice when dealing with reading fluency and it will provide policymakers with the information needed to implement this at a national or European level.\r\n\r\nLong term benefits of APPS include the implementation of the IT-literacy curriculum in primary schools and an improved knowledge among primary school teachers on how to use apps in a diversified classroom setting. This will benefit struggling readers all over Europe and will reduce the risks of them falling behind in society due to their literacy problems.
