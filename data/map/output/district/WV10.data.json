The volume of leachate produced is increased by rainfall. It cannot be directly discharged to water courses as it contains many hazardous pollutants and therefore must be retained for treatment. This proposal contains details of the approach we will take to develop an automated, modular, mobile leachate treatment system. The treatment will be carried out directly in an advanced oxidation process that uses reactions at both the anode and the cathode of a new form of electrolytic cell that we will develop. Whilst current treatment methods can be expensive to install and maintain, may involve the use of chemicals and require permanent positioning at the landfill site, our apparatus will allow new treatment strategies to be used by the landfill operators. The automated, mobile system will offer a flexibility of operation that is not currently available. Cost savings will be made due to the reduced treatment time of our system, using reactions at the anode and cathode rather than the anode only. Additional savings can be made by the use of renewable energy to power the process. Electricity is the only resource required, hence wind or photovoltaic generation of power would allow operating costs to be minimised. With over 150,000 landfill sites across Europe, and an estimated annual spend of \u20ac 10-17 billion on leachate treatment, there is already a large market available.

It is, in fact, over 10% of EU GDP (including the linked industries) and employs 9.7 million people and 1.8 million companies. In our country, the industry has, as a whole, about 191.000 businesses and, on 31st  December 2015, 886.000 employees, while in the two regions covered by the project (Sicily and Calabria), between 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, employment in the tourism sector has recorded an average increase compared to 2013-2014, by 3.8% in Sicily and 2.7% in Calabria. The data and projections show, however, on the one hand, the expansion of the sector and the tourist attractiveness of the two regions and, on the other hand, emphasize the need to provide trained young staff, highly qualified and able to respond positively to new and high competence requested by the local labor market.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy and ET 2020, WORK AWAY offers young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies: professionalism in the specific sector of TOURISM, soft skills, cultural knowledge and language skills. These general objectives are pursued through a mobility experience which consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 STUDENTS attending CLASSES IV and of 3 months for 80 newly graduated of the 8 participating VET Schools (Technical Institutes for Tourism and Hotel and Catering Schools). The project also promotes the exchange and transfer of good practices in VET by relating our VET system with the training and employment system to other European countries and contributes to the consolidation of the ECVET System.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY\r\n1. Transversal Activities: management and coordination; Dissemination and exploitation of results; Follow up;\r\n2. Mobility Preparation: Plan of communication and cooperation; Recruitment and selection of participants; preparation of participants; Learning plan definition;\r\n3.

As the labor market becomes increasingly international, Europe, and thus also our country, needs education and training paths that fully respond to these challenges. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of education and vocational training. This would help learners to reach high level qualifications, fundamental for a first successful inclusion in the labor market or to the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programs are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU Member States have recently set a target of allowing at least 6% of all learners in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through \"LEO quali-TC STRATEGY\", IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" and the other seven VET Schools involved, look at improving the quality of education and vocational training giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills and curriculum: professionalism in the specific areas of Tourism and Catering, cultural knowledge and language training. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 students in initial vocational training and of 3 months for 64 recently graduated learners.

Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20 neo-graduates for an internship abroad lasting 10 weeks\r\nThe activities will take place from 01.06.2017 until 31.01.2019 and includes the selection and preparation of students, the organization of the mobilities, activities abroad, evaluations, dissemination and follow-up activities.\r\nThe consortium plans to include in mobility 8 students with special needs, in detail students with DSA or BES.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed actions will be wide and will involve multiple levels of recipients in direct and indirect manner:\r\n\r\nstudents:\r\n- Competitiveness on the labor market;\r\n- Improving their social skills;\r\n- The acquisition of transversal skills (self-esteem, responsibility, ability to take tasks, ...) will also bring benefits to emancipation and employability;\r\n- Peers of the students are indirect beneficiaries, through the experiences of the participants in the action.\r\n\r\nTeachers:\r\n- The renewed interest in teaching will bring greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to manage projects;\r\n- Increased understanding of the training gaps of students who are entering the world of work;\r\n- Development of ECVET as tools for the recognition and validation of students' Learning Outcomes;\r\n- Increased understanding of the tourist business processes in Europe;\r\n- Increased ability to intervene on motivation and orientation of students, particularly those with

The 3DGoldSkills project was born within Arezzo\u2019s GOLD AND SILVER DISTRICT, which is one of the most traditional and historical sectors of Tuscan industry and that represents the Italian excellence in the world of jewellery. The current difficult economic situation, however, has resulted in a sharp change in the competitive landscape that had hitherto supported the growth of the sector. 3DGoldSkills aims at facing these issues by RAISING THE LEVELS OF DIFFERENTIATION AND INNOVATION within the industry. This will be possible through the YOUNG\u2019s training and specialization in the field of process and product innovation for the jewellery industry, as they will be able to support the companies\u2019 process of modernization (lacking of technology) as well as the process of development of advanced services, in order to compete in an evolving market increasingly invaded by competitors.\r\n3DGoldSkills aims at contributing to the increase of employability for students or young people who have recently completed a course of study in a professional school. This target will be achieved through two actions: students mobility and high school graduates mobility. The participating schools are professional-technical schools that have included in their curricula: courses related to chemistry applied to the gold sector (galvanic processes), courses related to rapid prototyping and new 3D technologies, courses related to design and art applied to the gold sector and to marketing / sales.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES. The project\u2019s main objective is to carry out mobility actions in the field of gold and silver for the young living in Arezzo. The planned activities are aimed at improving the participants\u2019 life and soft-skills, that will help them to be included in the labour market and hard skills, which could be useable in the GOLDSMITH field. In this way, the local businesses will be able to find, within the local labour market, trained and highly Europeanized young people, who will be able to support their business decisions of high strategic impact.\r\nThe project will also recognize and validate the LO through linear and clear procedures in compliance with the ECVET.  This will be possible thanks to the use of skills and credits recognition methods and tools  through Learning units, which shall be capitalised and turned into education and / or training credits.\r\n\r\nPROFILE AND NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n60 STUDENTS. 16/19 years old students attending State High Schools in Arezzo.\r\n20 HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES / QUALIFIED. Young people who have obtained a vocational qualification or diploma related to gold industry, by not more than 12 months. \r\nThe project involves the participation of young people with physical disabilities or Specific Learning Disability (SLD).\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES. The activities of the project shall be as follows:\r\n- Project management (divided into four main documents, enclosing the four key aspects of the sound management of the project: Control and Coordination Plan, Learning and Assessment Plan, Communication Management Plan, Dissemination and Valorisation Plan).\r\n- Trainees preparation (language, technical, educational and cultural training).\r\n- Internships identification and activation (following the selection of participants, the candidate-company MATCHING will be held in collaboration with the foreign parties, which will evaluate the participants profiles according businesses availability).\r\n- Accompaniment of underage participants with physical disabilities or SLD by adequately prepared subjects (mainly the teachers working in the participating Institutes)\r\n- Ongoing monitoring and ex post.\r\n- Final assessment (outcomes, project, good practices).\r\n- Dissemination and exploitation beyond the boundaries of the participating territories.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY. The activated methodologies are, essentially, practical and aimed at achieving effective, efficient and repeatable models.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT.

As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.  The project is therefore the result of co-operation between the consortium and its partners, and its design and structure reflect this co-operation in terms of the organisation and management of the project, in terms of the selection and preparation of the participants, the supervision of the mobilities, the evaluation, certification and validation of the skills acquired, and the dissemination of the results.

It contributes to the educational, social and professional integration of young people and adults and participates in international relations activities, particularly by encouraging exchanges and the welcoming of students, apprentices, students, trainees and teachers. The school possesses a 140 acres farm, a real business at the heart of this institution offering training throughout life.\r\n\r\nThe school is present throughout French Guiana through its headquarters located between Cayenne and Kourou, but also its remote branches (Saint Laurent du Maroni, Cacao and Maripasoula) and its actions in isolated districts in partnership with the Amazonian Park of French Guiana.\r\n\r\nFrench Guiana is the only European territory located in South America. It is 90% covered by the Amazon rainforest and is protected by various statuses.

They prepare diplomas such as the agricultural vocational diploma and high school vocational diplomas with specializations in agricultural production (breeding and market gardening), management of natural areas, but also trade in rural areas.\r\nMost of these learners come from sections in which one of their teachers has benefited or will benefit from an Erasmus + trainers mobility proposed by the Local Public Institution of Education and Vocational Training of French Guiana (these mobilities are included in the staff\u2019s training plan)\r\nThe training courses can take place in two ways:\r\n-  students going to the same region but to different agricultural farms (1 or 2 pupils per farm).

Within the framework of these training courses in Europe, the objective is twofold:\r\n- on the human level: immersion in another context, open-mindedness regarding other cultures.

To do this type of training course abroad is of particular interest: it will enable the learners to know other functions or techniques than those in France and French Guiana, to value their own know-how acquired in France through the exchange, to consolidate the learning of a foreign language, to be aware of the situation of an agricultural farm in another cultural environment, in other natural conditions than their region of origin.

In Europe, the project works with our 4 receiving partners, who each deliver our Enterprise and Employability curriculum in a manner common across the projects, and monitor progress and recognise achievements in a manner common across the project.The participants will develop a wider awareness of the chosen industry, improve their transferable vocational and soft skills, demonstrate initiative, build entrepreneurship, confidence and self-esteem, declare aspiration through their career development plans (job prospects) and improve their language skills and cultural awareness.We aim to boost employability, with participants gaining the sparkle they need to compete in the current job market - attaining the job they want, and being able to manage their own career development as a citizen of Europe. This economic activity benefits communities - communities looking inward upon themselves and gaining cohesion with active players, and looking outwards as a community or people, projects and employing organisations that each gain an European perspective.We build on Learning Plans by devising individual development plans that declare goals for self-development and ways of working in new teams and for new projects.  Learners are supported to be entrepreneurial and to gain confidence and presentation skills.The project works with three receiving partners, who each deliver our Enterprise and Employability curriculum in a manner common across the projects, and monitor progress and recognise achievements in a manner common across the project.The project lays the foundation stones for an active leisure consortium that comes to include more private training organisations in the UK delivering this curriculum and engaging with sector employers.
