At the same time, improving European educational and training system quality has been set as a key target in Europe\u2019s strategy for becoming a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy by 2020 (Council of European Union, 2010). As such specific goal to improve skills within the adult\u2019s education are seen in a key role. \r\n\r\nIn this context, \u201cTextile heritage - from the Wooden loOm Weaving to the Digital ARt\u201d (DARE2WOW) brings together 6 countries from all over Europe (Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, the UK, Latvia & Greece) to support the development, transfer and implementation of innovative practices within the partnering organizations and Europe by implementing the project\u2019s joint initiatives that promote cooperation, peer learning and exchange of experience at European level in the area of textile production and exploitation.\r\n\r\nThere are many methods for general improvement of adults\u2019 manual skill on the market; however, there is clearly a lack of model that identifies the capabilities (knowledge, skills and insights) to fill skill gaps in the area of textile production. There is a need for more flexible learning process - one that uses the innovative access to new technologies and peer-learning opportunities opposite to any of the few existing laborious and increasingly demanding educational programs of the formal education that stress on complexity and difficult terms with little connection to the two subject \u2013 manual work and digital capability. \r\n\r\n\u201cTextile heritage - from the Wooden loOm Weaving to the Digital ARt\u201d (DARE2WOW) project proposes a flexible and collaborative method, processes and tools for adults to increase their skill, knowledge and insights in their own pace and within their own understanding. The project promotes and strengthens the European cooperation while designing and piloting a new model, new tools and a new virtual platform between the partnering institutions but also for free access to all stakeholders to learn, develop and create a new understanding of the textile industry where technology, globalization and ecology are part of their textile production and exploitation. This will also be a space for discussing, trying and learning along the new concepts that could potentially improve one\u2019s life and bring prosperity and wellness while keeping eyes on the objectives, learning from others\u2019 experience and stimulating reflectivity on the possibilities that are out there when finding its place within the large textile industry. The project creates a tool for finding the best possible partners when looking for courses for adults, as well as a place for networking, sharing experiences, information and best practices. \r\n\r\nThe project implementation is based on common activities: conducting six transnational meetings that will be attended by representatives and experts from all participating countries; developing research and analysis on the methods used by the formal and in-formal education for adults in the participating country \u2013 shared experiences and case studies of good practice; developing a training module based on the Curriculum for Adults Education. The project derives from the experiences and actual needs distinguished in the partnering organizations to develop an adult educational tool and as such exploits the project results directly during its implementation. Thus the final result is to offer its beneficiaries an innovative tool that is well equipped to be directly applied in everyday life starting from the era of the digital art and going back to the way of wooden-loom weaving.", "http://www.sisuconsulting.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA204-015869_4"]]}}, "7AT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "H\u00e1romdimenzi\u00f3s rendszer gy\u00f3gypedag\u00f3giai haszn\u00e1lat\u00e1nak kidolgoz\u00e1sa a fogyat\u00e9koss\u00e1ggal \u00e9l\u0151 gyermekek t\u00e1rsadalmi beilleszked\u00e9s\u00e9nek el\u0151seg\u00edt\u00e9s\u00e9\u00e9rt", "The Park School", 82722.0, 3, 4, "Nowadays students tend to understand the world around them through visual stimuli; visual images are more easily processed and understood than the content of a traditional frontal lesson. Moreover, in education, the growing popularity of digital supplementary materials also reflects the preferences of today\u2019s net generation, for whom the digital world is the natural environment. Besides, among the students of the special education partner institutions participating in the consortium, the ratio of those students who require special education due to the immaturity of the nervous system and therefore cannot meet the requirements of mainstream curricula is also increasing. For these students, receiving different movement experiences is the most essential developmental stimulus to strengthen their attention concentration, develop different logical, mathematical, writing and reading skills. This, in turn, results in better complex thinking processes which enable them to perform more complex activities. Due to a better school performance the chances of early school drop-out are much lower. Likewise, the use of student-centred methods is more efficient in the development of the students\u2019 basic skills. Better school performance also induces a stronger professional profile of the teaching profession, and students also have a better life perspective, being more useful and valued members of the society.The aim of the tender is to adapt a three-dimensional displaying and analysing system, which is already applied with success in professional sport and different scientific areas, to the field of special education and development. The current project is set out to develop a model for the movement development supported by the three-dimensional system, thus contributing to the more efficient movement development of special needs students. The use of the three-dimensional system is not only useful for the students, but for the teachers as well, since they are provided with a measurement tool, which enables them to objectively measure the efficacy of a certain movement therapy.The coordinating institution aims to fulfil the above mentioned aims and results through a four-member consortium. The consortium includes two special education institutions, which provides education for students with mild intellectual disabilities. The third member of the consortium is a foundation, whose profile is the diagnosis, development and rehabilitation of special needs students. The fourth member of the partnership is a research enterprise focusing in the development of the three-dimensional system used in the project. The professional profiles of the participating colleagues cover a wide range of the field of special education and rehabilitation.The members of the partnership develop two intellectual outputs in the project. The first one is the methodology of the use of the three-dimensional system in special education. The second one is a handbook, available in printed and online form, on the development and use of the three-dimensional methodology. The handbook is edited in a way that it meets the requirements of a university coursebook. The development of the three-dimensional methodology is facilitated by two general and three institutional trainings. Besides, the methodology will be \u2018marketed\u2019 in various events. The results of the project will be presented in three local and regional workshops, besides, a national and an international conference will also be organized on the topic. The dissemination of the results will include national as well as international publications and workshops.The major result and effect of the project is going to be a faster speed at the acquisition of different movements on the students\u2019 part. The sense of success will result in a better school attitude and willingness to cooperate, and teachers will achieve higher added pedagogical values. This, in turn, will result in lower school aggression levels, better results in school competitions, and a bigger chance to be able to integrate in the mainstream society after their studies. Considering the teachers, they will have a better digital competence, will be more willing to cooperate at the school, and will be protected against burn-out.Finally, it can be concluded that by the implementation of this innovative method into special education, students with special needs will have a better chance to more fully integrate into the society. Thus, they will experience the importance of self-realization, the feeling of belonging and the support of their environment.", "http://www.thepark.surrey.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-HU01-KA201-022988_2"], [2014, "Professzion\u00e1lis gy\u00f3gypedag\u00f3gia az EGYMI-ben", "The Park School", 12415.0, 3, 3, "The Budapest 3rd District Kindergarten, Elementary School, Unified Special Education Institution (Szell\u0151 EGYMI) offers complex special educational assistance for students with special educational or mental needs living in the area. Considering recent tendencies, it is important to highlight that the number of autistic students, as well as students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds, for instance, orphanages, has dramatically increased. This phenomenon poses considerable challenge to the teachers of the school. As a consequence, to cater for the special needs, there is a growing number of extracurricular activities offered to the students. To be able to develop appropriate methods it is essential to gain thorough information about international good practices. Such experiences can form the basis of the transformation of the current system.\r\n\r\nThe Key Action 1 mobility funding is an excellent opportunity for the institution to be able to send five of its best-performing, most active and enthusiastic teachers to foreign schools for short periods of time. The two other schools participating in the program are two similar special education institutions located in the United Kingdom and Romania. Both schools provide ample opportunities to get acquainted with autism, information and communication technologies (ICT) and behavioural changes based on non-violent communication in an international setting. As a result, Szell\u0151 EGYMI can build good practices and technologies into its local educational practice.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these purposes, one colleague, well versed in inclusion and autism pedagogy, is going to visit the Special Education Elementary School in Sfantu Gheorghe, Romania, where she is going to teach lessons and take part in a ten-day course on autism. In the United Kingdom, three colleagues are going to visit The Park School, a similar special education institution, in Woking. During their stay, they are going to have the opportunity to extend their professional and methodological repertoire by observing a higher-level use of ICT devices, music therapy and movement development. The head of Szell\u0151 EGYMI is also going to visit both locations, thus being able to learn about the new good practices, visit lessons held by foreign and Hungarian colleagues, and have discussions with the other head teachers about the conditions needed for the introduction of the new methods.\r\n\r\nThanks to the fundings, the above described activities are going to have several positive effects and results on school life, in many cases filling in a niche. One such effect is the expansion of the professional and methodological repertoire of the participants, which results in the development of the colleagues\u2019 digital competence, a more efficient use of ICT devices and the improvement of the situation and inclusion of autistic students. The participating colleagues are going to have a broader perspective on special education in international settings, have a more improved linguistic competence and, not the least, have a lifetime experience. This can result in better work activity, more enthusiasm and a more positive attitude to work.

This programme runs over a two year period and can be completed in the following countries: United Kingdom, Ireland and Finland. Four departures will be organised in groups of 6 youths to better organise the training prior to departure.\r\nWe offer an internship of 15 days to supervisors in 6 European countries: Spain, Bulgaria, Ireland, United Kingdom, Finland and Germany. The periods are chosen based on availability of supervisors. This is actually an individualised career plan since these participants can also choose the host country and the type of business in which they want to do their internship.\r\nTo understand this issue we must not forget that if the targeted public is fixed, we do not actually know each individual personally since we are not a schooling organisation and do not know the participants before the selection is started.\r\nThe profile of beneficiaries:\r\nFor SFP: youths selected in the Missions Locales, are highly motivated ,available, registered as trainees in vocational training, willing with a real personal project to fulfil.\r\nFor supervisors: motivated and willing, they have an undeniable desire to evolve in their careers and to help their structure to progress to a new dimension, particularly a European one.\r\nDescription of participant\u2019s activities\r\nSFP: Harnessing the professional internship in companies by sector of activity, deepen linguistic knowledge (prior to departure and during the course if necessary) and be able to take advantage of this wonderful cultural and social experience which they are going to benefit from.\r\nSupervisors: Recognise, identify and discuss the work practices of social inclusion structures of other countries.

Among these, is the axis of 'European Identity Citizenship' with the European sections as means of rebuilding motivation, addressing the issues of absenteeism and school dropout, and promoting success, professional integration and the opening onto the world.\r\n\r\nThis axis aims at:\r\n      \u2013 making language learning more efficient in order to facilitate the integration of the youth population into the European labour\r\n          market, particularly thanks to a greater mobility programme,\r\n      \u2013 offering an intercultural project so as to make our pupils more aware of the existence of a European zone, of other cultures and\r\n          to develop a feeling of citizenship and to reinforce their European identity.\r\n      \u2013 Promoting equity and inclusion by giving the opportunity to an underprivileged public to access a mobility project that gives\r\n          credit to the student pathway.\r\n      \u2013 Stimulating partnerships with the neighbouring schools.\r\n\r\nIn this context, in 2005, after a successful experimental mobility project in 2004-2005, a European section in Spanish in Administrative & Management studies was created.

It holds the status of SEN (Special Educational Needs) school, which makes it benefit from an increase valuation.\r\n\r\nThe school site is situated in the education pool of Poissy/Sartrouville, which is classified as an EPA (Education Priority Area). It welcomes 688 pupils including 294 girls and 394 boys, all coming from very diverse origines as well as on a geographical level as on a sociological one. They are spread into four different streams of education:\r\n     \u2013 the services sector studies;\r\n      \u2013 the prevention and security studies;\r\n      \u2013 the performing Arts studies;\r\n      \u2013 the industrial engineering studies.\r\n\r\nThe school faces three major issues:\r\n      \u2013 a lot of pupils find it difficult to have a job,\r\n      \u2013 absenteeism and school dropout increase the risk of pupils  ending up with no job or being socially cast out after schooling,\r\n      \u2013 60% of the pupils come from underprivileged or very underprivileged backgrounds and 25% are eligible for a scholarship.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to solve these issues, the school set up a school project centred around five axes. Among these, is the axis of 'European Identity Citizenship' with the European sections as means of rebuilding motivation, addressing the issues of absenteeism and school dropout, and promoting success, professional integration and the opening onto the world.\r\n\r\nThis axis aims at:\r\n      \u2013 making language learning more efficient in order to facilitate the integration of the youth population into the European labour\r\n          market, particularly thanks to a greater mobility programme,\r\n      \u2013 offering an intercultural project so as to make our pupils more aware of the existence of a European zone, of other cultures and\r\n          to develop a feeling of citizenship and to reinforce their European identity.\r\n      \u2013 Promoting equity and inclusion by giving the opportunity to an underprivileged public to access a mobility project that gives\r\n          credit to the student pathway.\r\n      \u2013 Stimulating partnerships with the neighbouring schools.\r\n\r\nIn this context, in 2005, after a successful experimental mobility project in 2004-2005, a European section in Spanish in Administrative & Management studies was created. Later on, a European section in English was also created in 2011 for the administrative and management studies.\r\n\r\nSince their creation, every year, the school organises school trips for both the European sections. Until now, the projects have been financed by the FSE for one and for the other by the grants attributed as part of the LEONARDO program.\r\n\r\nEach year, between 20 and 30 of our pupils benefit from a mobility experience thanks to the different teams committed to the projects since the opening of the European sections.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring an answer to the identified needs, we strategically set up a series of activities that consist in:\r\n\r\n     \u2013 reinforcing and deepening the linguistic and cultural knowledge of pupils by adding extra hours of foreign languages \r\n        (one hour extra per  week from year 11 to year 13) and the intervention of a foreign language assistant.\r\n     \u2013 Developing and strengthening/ consolidating the pupils' professional skills by teaching them extra hours of their main\r\n        vocational subject in English or Spanish (2 hours weekly throughout the sixth form)\r\n     \u2013 planning training periods abroad (Spain and England) since 2005 (a five-week-mobility programme assorted with days of\r\n         integration and work experience in a company),\r\n     \u2013 organising activities to stimulate the awakening of the feeling of citizenship with the setting-up of visits and/or interventions,\r\n         together with a special discovery day of London and finally the European week of languages in the school.\r\n      \u2013 Using performing tools (language laboratories, audiovisual resources, etc. \u2026), and also increasing the use of ICT.\r\n\r\nOur project allows a five-week-long mobility including a period of integration and a work experience from November 8, 2015 to December 12, 2015.\r\nOn the one hand, it will be in Salamanca, Spain for 12 pupils (2 boys and 10 girls) from business studies, who are in their final year. On the other hand, 14 students (4 boys and 10 girls) from the Administrative and Management studies, will go to England.\r\n\r\nSince 2005, there is ample evidence that this experience of mobility contributes greatly to reduced absenteeism, to fight the dropout problem, to make easier our students' certification examinations, to pursue education and to their integration into employment.", "http://www.wsbhospices.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-013885_1"], [2014, "La mobilit\u00e9 un levier pour l'avenir professionnel", "THE WOKING HOSPICE", 51370.0, 3, 13, "Our project joins with the framework of the professional training, to improve the level of English of our students of 3 sections of vocational high school diploma to allow them a better occupational integration or a better pursuit of studies.

Early school leaving is a real problem in French vocational schools today and too many young people leave school without a diploma.The project unites students around it and gives them extra motivation.\r\n\u2022Give students in the section better access to higher education. For them a good standard of language skills is required. Most of our students continue their studies with Btec HND (2/3) either in Admin assistant courses or Executive assistant for small and medium size company courses.\r\n\u2022 Allow students to explore other ways of working. Indeed, the English or the Irish have a different pattern of the working day.\r\n\u2022 Gaining confidence. Our students have often been \u201cbroken\u201d by the school system. They arrive at the vocational school with bad attitudes and thinking that the requirements will be revised downwards. With this project, they discover that it is not so, and that this type of school offers innovative and enriching projects. \r\n\u2022 Develop a taste for travel abroad. Many of our students who have benefited from training abroad have felt encouraged to have other experiences abroad.\r\nA service provider is necessary to organize professional internships abroad.\r\n\u2022 find the appropriate company in line with the professional skills of the diploma, and the student\u2019s skills or abilities.\r\n\u2022 ensure the regular monitoring to each student and help them if necessary in their relation with the families or the companies.\r\n\u2022 Greet students and facilitate their integration\r\n\u2022 Find suitable accommodation with host families, people willing to accept French students in their homes. \r\n\u2022 Be in constant contact with students in order to intervene with families and businesses if necessary.\r\n\r\nThese service providers are selected on the quality of services offered.

In that respect, those flourishing programs ensure the future challenges that we need, however, to improve year after year.\r\n\r\nEach experience enables us to facilitate the students\u2019 professional integration in the midst of the European community. It also develops their personal fulfillment in the same way.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the leading team operates from the different questionnaires that the previous groups filled in after their mobility, so as to anticipate and avoid every possible future difficulties whatsoever.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the National Agency\u2019s remarks on the former applications, are very much taken into account as to enhance our organization.\r\nAlso, in order to broaden the possibilities in terms of teaching fields, our school allowed another class to enter the European Section (Seconde Administration and Accounting), in addition to the ARCU section (Reception, Customer relationship), that was already selected.\r\nSo that in 2014, a dozen students from these two sections are offered a mobility in the European Union between March and April.\r\n\r\nWe decided to select a  partner, for it seems rather difficult for the teaching team to set up a large repertory of Company addresses from a distance.\r\n\r\nThe mobility program will develop as such:\r\n- Host families \r\n- 4-week internship in a company\r\nThe program applies to our cosmopolitan students, whose social backgrounds are varied and most of the time rather modest.\r\nOn average, they have formely experienced difficulties at school and haven\u2019t been the ones to decide whether to prepare a professional exam or not.\r\nTheir presence in  Saint Fran\u00e7ois d\u2019Assise Technical School consequently being experienced as a failure in the first place.\r\n\r\nThus, as far as we\u2019re concerned, their level in English would not constitute a flaw whatsoever. Only their motivation being taken into account.\r\nThe European mobility program undoubtedly serves their genuine value and also participates in bringing them a major asset in that professional realm.\r\n\r\nOur students\u2019 main objectives are to improve their English levels, as well as their qualification and knowledge; to open up to other ways of lives and other cultures.\r\n\r\nThe program allows them to enlarge to other layouts and reflections.\r\n\r\nWe endeavor to match our students\u2019 personalities to the project and aim to include as many of them to participate to a mobility in Europe while acknowledging a professional and personal experience abroad.\r\n\r\nThe whole program will allow them to pass their Professional Bachelor successfully, honored by a \u201cEuropean mention\u201d, as well as Europro and Europass diplomas. These two latest being at stake as far as their training is concerned.\r\n\r\nWe noticed that those kinds of leading and challenging programs are in favor of our students\u2019opening which constitutes an indeniable asset for their further career.\r\nAlso, the program enables a better adaptation to the working field requirements, added to an easier integration.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, our goals remain realistic, in reference with the various criteria that our partners can provide.\r\n\r\nWhat we try to set up is a systematic remediation, in the aftermath of each mobility, in order to diagnose the problems and determine the needs for a successful program.\r\n\r\nThroughout various activities, we tend to promote our programs and never forget to mention their beneficial consequences.\r\n\r\nOur school is nowadays very much recognized for its efficient European programs.", "http://www.wsbhospices.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-001540_5"], [2016, "Erasmus+ facilitateur d'insertion professionnelle", "THE WOKING HOSPICE", 8839.0, 4, 14, "Our project joins within the framework of the professional training, to improve the vocational training of our pupils of 3 sections of vocational high school diploma to allow them a better occupational integration or a favored pursuit of studies.

This schoolyear (2014-2015) these tools have been implemented and this project is now in its beginning stage. To develop this further it is important that the team has a good idea of how the tools can be used in the daily practice. The International School (ISL) of Surrey is a school that uses A4L and L4L in an excellent way in their teaching. Two staffmember of Merlijn have already had a chance to experience this at ISL in the past. The next step would be that two other member will get the chance to visit ISL Surrey and job shadow other teachers of that school for two days. This way, they will get a good picture of how A4L and L4L are put into practice.  The two teammembers are selected because they use IPC (and English) on a daily basis.\r\nThe reason why we chose ISL Surrey is because they offer IPC in English and they have a lot of students who are second language learners of English. At Merlijn this is also the case. The teacher who teach IPC also have the need to develop their English school vocabulary. During their visit they will be immersed in English and they will expand their vocuabulary.\r\nAfter the visit the participants will share their experiences with the other team members. In that meeting a new plan will be developed with the whole team to further implement A4L and L4L at Merlijn. In the long run the school will profit from the visit, because the whole team will then have a good idea of how these tools can be used in schools.
