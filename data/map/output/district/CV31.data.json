As a result we have an increasing number of young people with a sense of exclusion, disbelief in democratic institutions, apathy and disenfranchisement. And those with the fewest skills or the fewest opportunities are most at risk. The further social exclusion of youth from deprived rural areas seems inevitable and there is a feeling that the formal education system doesn't always prepare youngsters for their future career. Some measures are being implemented, yet other ways to support young people need to be found.

By reaching out and broadening our partnership base, we feel we can be more effective with our dissemination activities, reach a wider range of people and sustain this activity through joint cooperation between many partners from different countries. \r\n\r\nThis Contact making Event will bring together 54 youth activists and youth workers from 6 different countries (UK, Estonia, Romania, Italy, Turkey and Portugal) to create an environment of diverse cultures, understanding of democracy and universal values such as freedom of expression, tolerance to cultural and racial differences, European awareness, intercultural dialogue and social inclusion.   \r\n\r\nThe objectives will include: building new partnerships between Erasmus Plus Programme Countries; facilitation of the inter-sectorial (NGOs, private businesses) networking process among participants and partner organisations; introduction of working methods of organisations with different backgrounds; exchanging principles and possible ways of youth participation and youth empowerment in a non formal way to support active citizenship and social inclusion; providing knowledge about possibilities of cooperation within the various aspects of Erasmus+ programme by presenting examples of efficient and successful cooperation, motivating youth workers/ youth activists to become project multipliers, and producing future high quality far reaching projects through international cooperation.\r\n \r\nThis activity will focus on aspects of non-formal education development in order to encourage potential partners to set up projects and future cooperation in forms of youth exchanges, EVS, training courses etc.  Through organisations\u2019 fair, project market, networking, cultural activities and traditional presentations and discussions, young activists and youth leaders will interact in a six-day project in which they will also be exposed to national diversities, and will work together to formulate ideas about how to promote youth empowerment, social inclusion and active citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe project will aim to enhance the cooperation between organisations from represented regions and wants to stimulate the creation of project ideas within actions open for cooperation within the Erasmus Plus Programme countries. An additional aim of this activity will be to find potential programme multipliers, who are ready to promote European youth opportunities in regions of their countries as well as to spread the learning from this activity. \r\n\r\nWe anticipate that this Contact making event will also further support our network of partner organisations.

This is especially burdensome to young people who, due to lack of practical skills, are often the last group to be hired.  Addressing the problem of youth unemployment and lack of practical skills (experience), requires finding innovative and entrepreneurial solutions that involve youth leaders, facilitators, local, regional and national communities as well as input and participation from the youth themselves.   \r\n\r\nAddressing youth unemployment also means addressing the \"fall out\" from unemployment as well:  social and economic exclusion,  disenfranchisement and lack of participation in society and citizenship on all levels.   \r\n\r\nOur partner organisations plan to address these issues via a project with a two step implementation phase aimed first at organizing a seminar to expand and explore solutions to these problems and second, a youth exchange, where through a programme facilitated by the partner organisations and spearheaded by the targeted youth themselves, these methods will be addressed in innovative and entrepreneurial ways to create sustainable solutions that can be disseminated throughout local communities to impact an ever growing audience of people. \r\n\r\nEach project Activity (Seminar and the Youth Exchange) will bring together 24 participants from the UK and Lithuania.  The objectives of this project will be to bring together youth leaders and at risk youth in a tolerant and inclusive environment to work together to help resolve and remediate the issues related to unemployment, poverty and social exclusion  focusing on innovative solutions and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe seminar will bring together youth leaders and facilitators and will focus on training them to be educators, facilitators and stimulator's to create an energetic and innovative youth exchange.

Among these barriers are the labour market issues and challenges with getting continued education.\r\n\r\nWhile carrying out projects all across Europe our partnership has discovered that young people representing remote rural areas have one peculiar advantage - familiarity with the environment of the rural areas they live, in terms of knowledge of its strong sides as well as commitment and passion to live rural. Therefore, a \u201crecipe\u201d of engaging such committed youth in social entrepreneurship is seen as boosting opportunities for youngsters to provide for themselves and benefit their rural communities.\r\n\r\nSocial entrepreneurship is the attempt to draw upon business techniques and private sector approaches to find solutions to social, cultural, or environmental problems. Social entrepreneurship typically takes into account a positive \"return to society\" and often closely interconnected with the voluntary sector.\r\n\r\nThis 10 days' youth exchange will bring together young people from the UK, Portugal, Sweden, and Latvia to Porto, Portugal from the 28th of September to the 7th of October, 2017 to work on \"recipes\" for social entrepreneurship in rural areas. The developed cookbook of \u201crecipes\u201d will allow to follow up, disseminate, and multiply the developed ideas/projects upon return home.\r\n\r\nWith this project we also want to promote non-formal ways of communication between the participating groups of young people from rural areas by letting them share their ideas, skills and achievements in peer-led workshops. It includes the youth participation aspect as it is strongly present in non-formal education, peer leadership and peer education.\r\n\r\nOur objectives as related to the topic of the youth exchange are as follows:\r\n\r\n\u2022 To reflect, discuss and learn about challenges for young people in rural areas;\r\n\u2022 To analyse the role of social entrepreneurship for inclusion of young people living in rural areas;\r\n\u2022 To examine how the non-formal learning and social entrepreneurship can positively impact on the lives of young people from rural areas throughout Europe and agree upon action-centred activities that assist young people to address the issues raised;\r\n\u2022 To practice peer-led approach of non-formal groups in a youth exchange;\r\n\u2022 To make progress in recognition of non-formal learning and social entrepreneurs\u2019 inputs and achievements;\r\n\u2022 To raise awareness and understanding of the peer-led techniques;\r\n\u2022 To encourage full participation and taking on of responsibility by young people in all aspects of the exchange;\r\n\u2022 To raise cultural awareness between our countries and to promote cooperation and understandinng. \r\n\r\nThe target group for the exchange is youngsters coming from rural areas with an age from 18-25. These youngsters are experiencing exclusion with economical, social and educational challenges to overcome. Empowering them to set socially valuable goals and giving them tools to reach these goals will make our societies healthier and more humanistic.\r\n\r\nWe have planned the programme in a way that it will allow the young people from each country to meet and plan their own national presentations and evenings and then during the exchange they will make a similar active contribution in international teams on their chosen workshop. Workshops will be led by youngsters themselves and will allow their skill or talent or achievement in certain field to be shared with other participants in the peer group. Then they will make an effort to make this work towards the benefit of the local community or a local target group through the developed social entrepreneurship projects in accordance with the OPEN SPACE technology.\r\n\r\nDuring the exchange we will use activities, workshops, presentations, facilitated exchange of experiences and best practices.

Innovative thinking speeds up and improves the very meaning of community volunteering, making it more Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this Mobility project belongs to the young people who feel certain that such international Youth Exchange can create innovation-friendly environment that makes it easier for great ideas to be turned into community-oriented projects.\r\n\r\nThe project will bring together partner organizations from the UK, Estonia, Turkey and Lithuania. The exchange will take place in Lentvaris, Lithuania. Each country will be represented by 15 young people and 3 youth peer leaders. The idea can be further developed in local projects after the exchange and serve as an inspiration for developing follow-up projects by the participants who will establish new contacts for future co-operation. Furthermore, the participants will be introduced to a set of brand new methods and tools for generating ideas and developing strategies for successful project implementation, get familiarized with the basic tools in project making/project management. The exchange will shed light on the objectives, strategies, project phases and evaluation guidelines and enable the participants to share their best practices and start the process of developing ideas for future co-operations.\r\n\r\nThe target group for this exchange is young people with lesser socio-economic opportunities motivated to improve their knowledge, skills and understanding to play an effective role in society, to become visible as a members of their communities. In addition, these young people are motivated to become more self-confident and develop a sense of responsibility for themselves as well as their surroundings. Their careful selection is one of the main aspects of this youth exchange to be taken care of by all the partner organisations.\r\n\r\nThe approach used during the exchange itself will be workshop based, which will include discussions, sharing of ideas and practical activity e.g. role play, world caf\u00e9, open spaces etc. to aid learning. Young people from partner groups will also prepare artistic, creative workshops in a medium of their own choice. This will not only provide opportunities for exploring the theme of active citizenship but will also act as a means of inclusion and intercultural learning as they are prepared to run the workshops with mixed nationality groups and also to publicise it to the local young people and public in the vicinity of the exchange. This will also ensure that the young people have been involved in the design and implementation of the programme.\r\n\r\nThe exchange will have a strong non-formal empowerment / training dimension pursued in workshops of World Caf\u00e9, Open Spaces and other strong non-formal education tools. These tools will aim to introduce participants to concepts such as citizenship, human rights, diversity, democracy and civil society.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this project can greatly contribute to the personal development of  participants. In the series of workshops participants will learn:\r\n\r\n- using imagination to consider the situation of others;\r\n- about the barriers to volunteering and active citizenship and ways to overcome those barriers;\r\n- analysing the role of community;\r\n- the difference between positive and negative action;\r\n- that everyone can make a difference;\r\n- the variety of ways in which a person can be an active citizen.\r\n\r\nThis project will also have a strong European dimension and stimulate reflection on the emerging European society and its values.

After taking part in such activity young people will certainly value the experience they have gained. They will make friends with young people from different countries and of various nationalities, learn a lot about various parts of Europe, its shared values and its heritage.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the exchange and its results will also be transferred and used in the participating partner organisations according to the agreements drawn between the participants and the partner organisations.

They hamper productivity and competitiveness, and fuel poverty and social exclusion. Nowadays, Europe is facing a high number of unemployed young people. The consequences of high unemployment are not merely economic, but Europe also risks a 'lost generation' of young people that, as they cannot participate in society, result in low self-esteem, low motivation and even radicalisation of thoughts and cynicism. It is a threat to the personal development of these young people as well as society and Europe as a whole. \r\n\r\nWe developed this youth exchange because we believe that it is important for young people \u2013 as well as for the future of Europe \u2013 to be inspired to learn, to develop their talents, skills and attitudes towards themselves and towards the society.

This implies that the exchange will develop certain attitudes and skills both in young people and peer leaders to improve European citizenship education in peer-to- peer youth work as well as to explore and to understand experiential learning and outdoor education methodology as an approach to youth citizenship education. \r\n\r\nThis 10 days youth exchange will bring together 14 young people and 2 group leaders from the UK, Turkey, Ukraine and Azerbaijan to Baku region of Azerbaijan from the 1st  till the 10th of December 2014.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n- to present and discuss the legal background for developing youth work connected with EC between EU and Partner countries.\r\n- to explore possible policies and strategies of making EC present on all levels of youth work concentrating on a grassroot level.\r\n- to explore and understand experiential learning and outdoor education methodology as an approach for youth citizenship education.\r\n-  to stimulate the active participation of young people in European policy-making.\r\n- to develop attitudes and skills of young people and peer leaders for improving citizenship education in peer to peer youth work. \r\n- to reflect on essences (principles, attitudes) of democratic citizenship, to increase awareness about skills and attitudes of young people that should be developed for becoming active European citizens (through youth work activities).\r\n- to identify and compare what is to be a European in Azerbaijan and Partner countries (non EU members) and EU itself.\r\n- to increase understanding how non-formal learning can enable to develop those skills and attitudes of young people (reflect on principles of non-formal learning through practical exercises and reflection sessions).\r\n- to develop skills to use experiential learning as an approach in citizenship education (by reflection on experiential activities and by running workshops during the exchange).\r\n- to develop EU - non-EU partners co-operation in the youth field by empowering young people to participate in the development of European youth projects.\r\n\r\nThe target group for the exchange is youngsters with lesser opportunities.

So while the economy is apparently doing better, that's not actually what's happening for young people from linguistic minority communities.The innovativeness of this project is in its aim to promote social inclusion and active youth participation by empowering peers to address these issues in their immediate daily peer group environment of different linguistic minorities suffering from unemployment and social exclusion.The youth exchange will involve 12  participants and two leaders from each of the partner groups in the UK, Belarus, Turkey and Azerbaijan and will take place in Baku Azerbaijan for 12 days.The target group for this exchange project are young people from linguistic minority families who face employment, educational and /or training difficulties, including those with a difficult social/economic background. This target group have fewer opportunities to participate in any exchanges and get intercultural understanding. They do not possess  sufficient resources to get international experience. But empowering them to set socially valuable goals and giving them instruments to reach these goals will make our partner European communities healthier, more human and inclusive.With this project we want to promote non-formal ways of communication between groups of linguistic minority young people coming from different European countries. In the midst of the constantly increasing unemployment rates among young people in Europe, there arises a need for innovative strategies aimed at improving young people's chances in the labour market. In the modern world where many organisations work on a multinational level, their future employees are expected to have competences which will enable them to work in an international environment. They are Inter Cultural Learning (ICL) Skills.Many young people get important practical skills in formal education establishments, but at the same time they often lack certain intercultural communication skills. Such skills are also essential to build a successful career. Besides, as modern societies are culturally diverse, the ability to successfully cooperate with people with different cultural backgrounds became a truly important both in private life and in the professional field.Therefore, our partnership discussed an opportunity to undertake this International Mobility Project involving a specific target group - young people from national, ethnic and linguistic minority groups - in order to provide them with a basic set of essential inter cultural communication competences that will both boost their chances in the labour market and contribute to their social and cultural development. Our Youth Exchange will be focused on developing employability skills of national, ethnic and linguistic minority youth and enabling them to explore inter cultural learning (ICL) principles. At the same time, non-formal education methods will be promoted.A balanced set of theoretical and practical sessions will enable the partnership to achieve the objectives set for the project. These objectives include:- Sharing realities and exploring the existing situation with unemployment of national, ethnic and linguistic minority youth;- To find common ground in the issues related to inter cultural learning as the key to employability and development of such skills;- To find possible ways of including national, ethnic and linguistic minority youth in social life by developing their inter cultural learning and social skills;- To discover the effect of inter cultural learning on numerous aspects of a young person\u2019s life;- To discuss and understand how social inclusion and employment policies in the participating countries influence us as citizens;- To discuss how non-formal education can positively influence youth employability and to discover examples of best employment practices related to young people having national, ethnic and linguistic minority background;- To empower participants to become active citizens;- To encourage the young people to become examples to their peers;- To present the Erasmus+ programme and to encourage the creation of future projects with young people having national, ethnic and linguistic minority background as the target group.After the Youth Exchange the participants will be encouraged to act as multipliers, applying the newly obtained knowledge with their peers in their local communities.", "http://www.wayc.org.uk", "Warwickshire Association of Youth Clubs", "erasmus_2016-2-UK01-KA105-024755_coordinator"], [2015, "Young women\u2019s empowerment for active citizenship", "Warwickshire Association of Youth Clubs", 35573.0, 4, 4, "Our partnership\u2019s research demonstrated that struggle for one\u2019s rights should begin at an early age.

It includes active youth participation aspect due to its strong presence in non-formal education, peer leadership and peer education.\r\n\r\nOur partner from Azerbaijan proposed to run the youth exchange in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, as they believe that the situation with young women's status in the East tends to be much more severe than that in the West. For a long time women in Eastern countries remained within the four walls of their household, their dependence on men was total.

Adopting healthy behaviours early in life leads to benefits not just to the individual (physical, mental, social, emotional) but also benefits society (lower burden of illness, more productive and engaged citizens). Our proposed project is aiming to educate and highlight the advantages of a healthy lifestyle. We plan to conduct a youth exchange focusing on healthy behaviour with a special emphasis on the use of sports volunteering as a sustainable method by which to achieve this goal. The proposed youth project is the result of a collaborative effort by four diverse partners who all bring experience, commitment and enthusiasm to our project's theme.  We will bring together 64 young people from the UK, Portugal, Lithuania, and Turkey to participate in a 10 day Youth Exchange to be held in Portugal that will focus on the promotion of healthy life long behaviours through sports volunteering activities.   Each partner has previously worked on projects related on the promotion of healthy behaviors and the partners  were chosen for this project because it is an area of keen interest to each organisation and each recognizes the need to promote healthy behaviours to a wider and wider audience.  By bringing together the different perspectives and experiences of each of the partners we feel that we can create a stronger and more capable partnership that can run a effective youth exchange and multiple the results internationally. With this youth exchange we plan to spread the message on the advantages of the healthy behaviours by publicising the idea of a healthy lifestyle and sports volunteering in the European communities we represent. We will build on the previous knowledge and experience we have in this area, encourage innovative contributions to our project's design and ensure that the project is firmly  rooted within the local community.  This youth exchange will make it possible for the participants to meet for exploring volunteering as a strong tool to support their ideas and spread their message related to healthy behaviours far and wide and to practice healthy lifestyle and sports volunteering as part of the field work activity.The main objectives of the youth exchange:- Promoting the advantages of healthy behaviours by publicising the idea of healthy lifestyles and sports volunteering in the partner European communities.- Exploring volunteering as a strong tool to support participants' ideas and spread the message related to healthy behaviours far and wide.- Stimulating teamwork between the partners that will lead to further evolution of the theme of promotion of healthy behaviours through lifestyle changes and sports volunteering so that its impact at all levels of community can be increased.- Practicing healthy lifestyle and sports volunteering as part of the field work activity.- Providing participants with Youth Pass accreditation.We plan to reach continuous cooperation by inviting both those who are experienced in European youth work and newcomers.  The participants will be young people who will come from regions or communities that give fewer opportunities in social, economic or geographic aspects (peripheral areas). The national economic structures of the countries normally do not offer these young people opportunities to gain international experience. The Erasmus+ Programme can be a very good opportunity for them to get inter-cultural experience as well as help advance the cause of promoting healthy behaviours.The main activities during this youth exchange will be workshop based, and will include facilitated discussions, educational means and techniques featuring good practice sharing, simulation exercises, role-play, an inspirational visit to a local organisation,  and outdoor activities as lively non-formal means of education. Young people from partner groups will also prepare artistic, creative workshops related to the project theme that they have designed themselves. The advantages gained and skills acquired at the exchange will be used not only by participants of the project but will also be disseminated by local youth groups as well as the organisations that take part in intercultural follow up projects (which will be very strongly  encouraged and supported). We wish to expand pour influence nationaly and internationally by initiating cooperation with the Erasmus + Programme Countries and promotion of the Erasmus + programme itself. We anticipate this leading to  follow-up projects and continued usage of the skills gained during this exchange, especially in respect to valorisation and  transfer of knowledge.The participants will be given records of what was accomplished during the exchange so that they can share it in their local groups and communities by making presentations and organising workshops.

It perpetuates the cycle of which it is part. In the long-term, Early School Leaving constitutes a tremendous waste of potential, for individual, social and economic development. Young people with poor school performance and early school-leavers are more likely to be unemployed, to be in precarious and low-paid jobs, to draw on welfare and other social programmes throughout their lives, and to encounter difficulties in gaining a place in vocational training. They are much less likely to be \"active citizens\" and to become involved in lifelong learning. \r\n\r\nWe developed this youth exchange because we believe that it is important for young people \u2013 as well as for the future of Europe \u2013 to be inspired to learn, to develop their talents, skills and attitudes towards themselves and towards the society.

During the workshops on what European citizenship means for representatives of different corners of Europe it was highlighted that European citizenship is perceived as a feeling of historical, social and cultural bonds to the continent sharing its common past, present and future rather than any political/economic union and at that practicing active attitudes to play an effective role on all levels of responsible youth participation.The aim of this 11 days Youth Exchange is to develop the attitudes and skills of young people and peer leaders for improving European citizenship education in peer-to-peer youth work as well as to explore and understand experiential learning and outdoor education methodology as an approach for youth citizenship education.

We believe that volunteer activism in developing grassroots sports is the most successful and innovative way to engage young people in healthy lifestyles, demonstrate and promote healthy behaviours and create opportunities for them. \r\n\r\nThe concrete objectives of the exchange will include: improving self-organisation and responsibility-taking skills of every participant; promoting healthy behaviours, social inclusion and active participation of young people in society; creating presentations in promoting the concept of sports volunteering and volunteer activism in developing grassroots sports in a creative way; increasing the participation by young people with fewer opportunities in the civic life of their community.\r\n\r\nThe venue of the youth exchange in the Republic of Bashkortostan republic , Russia was chosen as a vivid example of multinational and multicultural area where different minority groups live including Bashkirs. In this area particular attention is given to the development of voluntary youth work and promotion of the idea of healthy lifestyle. The republic actively supports sports volunteering projects together with a wide network of youth organisations active in this field.\r\n\r\nThe proposed youth exchange has an extensive role of the peer led groups approach as most of the workshops will be led by those young people that have former experience of local projects, youth exchanges or EVS with other partners and have built their own position within their youth organisations on active involvement in the previous youth projects. Now some feel the capacity to promote their achievements in the international cooperation project by building up new sustainable links/networks and promoting the idea and values of sports volunteering using creative artistic means to advance the level of participation of young people with fewer opportunities in volunteering for inclusion through non - competitive games and sports.\r\n\r\nThe young people - participants of the exchange will have different experiences in intercultural contacts from nil to quite experienced peer leaders and ex EVS volunteers. By using knowledge and experience got during the previous projects and involving suitable methods and ensuring that the project is firmly rooted within the local community, we hope that this youth exchange will give the possibility of reaching out to young people with fewer opportunities through sports volunteering in Europe.  \r\n\r\nEducational objectives of this youth exchange are to be reached rather by real experience together in the group than by theoretical inputs.

Social exclusion of young people, in particular youth in a NEET situation, can have negative consequences for the economy and significant costs for Europe. According to the research made by Eurofound (http://eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/labourmarket/youth) the economic loss due to the disengagement of young people from the labour market is over 150 billion euro. \r\n\r\nTherefore, early and non formal holistic interventions are needed. Based on these findings and conclusions our partnership of youth organisations from the UK, Lithuania, Turkey and Portugal decided to undertake this multilateral youth exchange aiming at promotion of social inclusion and active citizenship of young people in NEET situation by empowering them to initiate, design and organize specific creative and innovative grass-root projects and activities for the communities they live in. \r\n\r\nThe participants of the exchange will be 14 young people who are not in an employment, education or training situation and 2 group leaders from the participating organisations.

After these encounters (seminars, training courses) they raised awareness of intercultural problems in modern Europe and now are willing to share innovative visions and practice possible ways of social and community inclusion of unemployed migrant youth by facilitating Intercultural learning process in their local and regional peer led projects. The innovative feature of this project is that we aim at developing the Inter Cultural Learning process by empowering peers to address this issue in their immediate daily peer group environment of multicultural communities suffering from unemployment.

To introduce the revised European Charter on the Participation of Young People having unemployment problems in Local and Regional Life and to develop ways and competences in using it.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this youth exchange we would like to demonstrate what our values are and popularize the concept of non formal education and inclusion in an original way among the local people through grassroots sports.\r\nWe plan to further adhere the principle of self organization and unemployed youth empowerment where the youngsters are very much involved in the planning process not only before and during the exchange but also as results exploitation after the exchange. \r\n\r\nThe youth exchange is planned to take place in Gomel region, Belarus. In this area particular attention is given to the promotion of unemployed youth non formal education and inclusion through sports and outdoor activities. The administration of Gomel region actively supports projects aimed at promotion of non formal education and inclusion through grassroots sports and sportive games together with a wide network of youth organizations active in this field.\r\n\r\nThe proposed youth exchange has an extensive role of the peer led groups approach as most of the workshops will be led by the young people having former experience of different  youth projects with other partners. They feel the capacity to promote their achievements in the international cooperation project by building up new sustainable links/networks and promoting \r\nnon formal education and inclusion of unemployed youth through grassroots sports\r\n\r\nThe young people - participants of the exchange will have different experiences in intercultural contacts from nill to a quite experienced peer leaders and ex EVS volunteers. By using knowledge and experience got during the previous projects and involving suitable methods and ensuring that the project is firmly rooted within the local community, we hope that this youth exchange will give the possibility of reaching out to unemployed young people through grassroots sports and games in Europe.  \r\n\r\nEducational objectives of this youth exchange are to be reached rather by real experience together in the group than by theoretical inputs. The methods of non formal education such as using facilitated discussion, developing positive relations and delivering projects will engage young people in the exchange. These methods increase participation of unemployed youth, empower young people to make changes in their lives and promote equality of opportunity, diversity and sharing experiences.\r\n\r\nOne of the project\u2019s aims is also to initiate cooperation with the Neighbouring Partner countries.

During the workshops on what European citizenship (EC) means for representatives of different corners of Europe it was highlighted that EC is perceived as a feeling of historical, social and cultural bonds to the continent sharing its common past, present and future rather than any political union. \r\n\r\nThe theme of this exchange is promoting EU Citizenship and the rights that go with it through youth entrepreneurship initiatives using social responsibility approach, thus enabling young people to act as active, informed citizens. This implies that the exchange will develop certain attitudes and skills both in young people and peer leaders to improve European citizenship education through youth entrepreneurship initiatives in peer-to- peer youth work as well as to explore and to understand active youth participation approach to youth citizenship education. \r\n\r\nThe 10 days Activity will bring together 14 young people and 2 group leaders from the UK, Estonia, Romania and Italy to Catania.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n \r\n1. To explore and understand the meaning of EC  for young people in old and new EU member states.\r\n2 To develop attitudes and skills of young people and peer leaders for improving citizenship education through socially responsible entrepreneurship initiatives . \r\n3. To increase understanding how non-formal learning can enable and develop those skills and attitudes of young people (reflect on principles of non-formal learning through practical exercises and reflection sessions).\r\n4. To raise awareness of the need for youth citizenship education through socially responsible entrepreneurship \r\n\r\nThe exchange will initiate new youth participation projects with young people having economic and employment problems in order for them to become motivated and trained in youth citizenship issues through socially responsible entrepreneurship using  empowerment and inclusion methodologies.\r\n\r\nThe project methodology will be based on active youth participation approach. The activities foreseen during the project will be workshop based, which will include practical activity (presentations of participants and organisations; intro to European citizenship  / active citizenship through socially resposnsible entrepreneurship initiatives; intro to active youth participation approach; presentation of the Erasmus + Programme), facilitated discussions, sharing of ideas. \r\n\r\nThe exchange will develop certain attitudes and skills both in young people and peer leaders to improve European citizenship education in peer-to- peer youth work as well as to understand active youth participation approach to youth citizenship education.  \r\nThis youth exchange will allow participants to explore more from each other and with inputs from experienced youth workers on how we can make our youth organisations and networks play a more effective and challenging role in making these important issues really work for the youth sector of European region and making the European citizenship meaningful in all parts of Europe. \r\n\r\nThe impact of the exchange and its results will also be transferred and used in the participating partner organisations.

Participating partner organizations agreed that inclusion and empowerment of youth representing different national and ethnic minority groups is essential for European youth policy development, advancement of solidarity, participation and democracy. However, they felt that this issue is a complex one, it needs to be explored in the more targeted type of environment and addressed with peer education dimension as they find it important to include and facilitate this aspect in their own international peer led initiatives and projects.

With the youth exchange \u201cNEETing the change\u201d our partnership consisting of partner organisations from the UK, Lithuania, Latvia, and Turkey is aiming to empower young people for community participation and equipping them with skills to overcome NEET situation.The project intends to explore the current situation regarding unemployment in Europe, the conditions under which young people live, their educational background, the match (or mismatch) between their studies and what they want to do in their lives. The facilitators will equip young people with tools that allow them to identify their talents, their skills, their interests and passions in order to get employed (or self-employed). The need to provide sustainable rather than temporary solutions will be explicitly discussed and practiced. Young talents will be inspired and empowered to practice social inclusion, work with community and overcome NEET situation.

At the events they discussed the steps we should take to raise young people's awareness on the ecological problems. As a result of the final workshops practiced there youngsters came to the conclusion that responsibility means that they must learn how to influence important public decisions in the field of ecological environment protection that affect them in many ways. However, this was noticed to be a challenging issue that should be explored with the help of relevant non-formal methodologies and appropriate scope of activities within the frameworks of a specialised project targeting deprived urban areas as they are mostly disposed to ecological risks and hazards. \r\n\r\nWith this project our partnership aims to give an opportunity to young people from deprived urban areas of the UK, Turkey, Belarus and Moldova to find out more about possible dangers of ignoring environmental problems that our communities face and learn how to keep a close watch on potentially dangerous actions and policies by initiating participation projects. The project will help the young people to learn about dangers of man-made actions for the environment and equip them with tools to participate in environmental solutions. The participants will be motivated to raise public awareness about possible dangers of ignoring environmental problems, especially among their peer group - young people coming from deprived urban areas. \r\n\r\nAs a result of this project young people supported by their sending organisations will develop strategies for contributing to environment protection and form teams that can control environmental situations in their own community.
