All of the leading European research groups with activities in nanosafety, nanorisk assessment, and nanotoxicology are represented in NanoImpactNet. All exposure routes, major disease classes and impact assessment approaches are represented within the network. It will coordinate activities within Europe. It will help implement the EU Actionplan for Nanotechnology and support a responsible and safe development of nanotechnologies in Europe.", 36395.0, 2768163.0, 12, 26, "NANOIMPACTNET", "http://www.nanoimpactnet.eu", "http://www.smuc.ac.uk", null, "fp7_86639_998579984"]]}, "erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "ST MARY'S UNIVERSITY TWICKENHAM", 28934.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.smuc.ac.uk", "ST MARY'S UNIVERSITY TWICKENHAM", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035370_coordinator"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "ST MARY'S UNIVERSITY TWICKENHAM", 26082.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.smuc.ac.uk", "ST MARY'S UNIVERSITY TWICKENHAM", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046772_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "ST MARY'S UNIVERSITY COLLEGE TWICKENHAM", 16266.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.smuc.ac.uk", "ST MARY'S UNIVERSITY COLLEGE TWICKENHAM", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023306_coordinator"], [2015, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "ST MARY'S UNIVERSITY COLLEGE TWICKENHAM", 10273.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.smuc.ac.uk", "ST MARY'S UNIVERSITY COLLEGE TWICKENHAM", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-013147_coordinator"], [2014, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "ST MARY'S UNIVERSITY COLLEGE TWICKENHAM", 1070.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.smuc.ac.uk", "ST MARY'S UNIVERSITY COLLEGE TWICKENHAM", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000064_coordinator"]]}}}}
