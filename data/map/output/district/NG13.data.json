However despite these growth rates, the proportion of RES used for domestic heating and hot water is still under one percent. The main barrier is the high equipment and installation cost of the technology. In addition solar thermal yields cannot always be optimally utilised in existing hot water and heating systems. This is due to the limited size and operating temperature range of conventional thermal energy stores. Increasing the contribution of RES will also necessitate larger thermal stores, which is often difficult due to space and cost constraints. Although higher density Phase Change Materials (PCM) show promising results, they have not been proven to deliver real improvements in domestic applications. In PipeStore, we propose to develop a modular and low cost thermal storage technology, based on a \u2018pipes-in-a-pipe\u2019 configuration that can contain a range of PCMs. These will have different melting temperatures, enabling the storage of lower grade thermal energy. This will increase the effective utilisation of a typical solar system by up to twenty percent. Furthermore, a novel actuation and control system will facilitate the use of supercooled PCMs. This will be enable optimal energy storage with a controlled rapid thermal discharge. PipeStore can be scaled and customised to suit any RES in any property. The technology can be positioned in a loft, between walls or in a garage etc. This means that buildings with space limitations can also benefit from RES. The market for thermal storage relating to RES is currently \u20ac500 million in the EU and is expected to expand at a rate of at least ten percent per year. Our aim is to capture a five percent market share by 2020 which will be worth \u20ac40 million per year.", 244944.0, 824655.0, 4, 6, "PIPESTORE", "http://www.pipestore.eu/", "http://www.newwaveinnovation.com", null, "fp7_107652_984860401"], [1317427200000, 1380499200000, "Second Generation Unit Load Device to improve the Security and Efficiency of the Aerospace Logistics Industry", "New Wave Innovation Limited", "The SAFEGUARD project presents a new technology to improve the security and efficiency of air cargo through the research and development of a second generation Unit Load Device (ULD). With 1 million ULDs around the world worth over 900 million Euros, they are a crucial element of the global aviation industry. For example, in 2009, 80 million tonnes of air cargo was carried by the existing ULD fleet. However, 26 million tonnes of this cargo (33%) was transported on passenger aircraft and industry experts agree that air cargo is the weak link in the supply chain. Considering the potential security problems around the global air cargo supply chain, there is an urgent need to review and improve existing technological solutions. Over the last 20 years, incremental improvements have primarily focused on weight reduction, which has resulted in compromised security within the supply chain. The research and development of the SAFEGUARD technology will result in a step change improvement in the security of air cargo supply chain, in addition to large economic savings and logistics improvements for airlines. The proposed technology will overcome the existing security concerns in the supply chain, as well as reducing the ULD weight, minimising supply chain imbalances for ULD availability and the current high maintenance requirements. Following the research program, the new technology will enable our SME consortium partners to jointly commercialise a new product, with forecast revenues of 105 million Euros to 2020 and significant advancements in air cargo supply chain security.", 235991.0, 1100820.0, 4, 8, "SAFEGUARD", null, "http://www.newwaveinnovation.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/149393.jpg", "fp7_101433_984860401"], [1317427200000, 1380499200000, "Development of a highly efficient, innovative beverage COOLer", "New Wave Innovation Limited", "The total EU stock of beverage coolers is currently 6.3 million, which is nearly 50% of the total number of commercial display refrigerators in use. So far commercial refrigerators have remained outside EC legislation. However, this is likely to change as it is now generally accepted that commercial refrigerators offer significant potential for energy savings. A recent working document for the implementation of the Ecodesign Directive outlines several legislative options that will encourage and mandate significant energy efficiency improvements for beverage coolers.  Compared to similar sized domestic refrigerators, the energy consumption of commercial beverage coolers can be over 3 times higher, even after allowing for increased heat loads, due to use of glass doors, for example. This is the result of a combination of factors such as: i) lack of legislation and standardization; ii) user requirements in relation to pull down (cooling rate of products within a set time frame), which means that the refrigeration system of most coolers is significantly oversized; iii) the fact that the large majority of equipment owners do not operate the beverage coolers and hence do not pay for operating cost. This means that cost and design are the most important drivers and not efficiency. We aim to overcome these barriers by development of unique technology that makes effective use of phase change materials (PCM) within beverage coolers. This will allow downsizing of the cooling system, thereby significantly increasing energy efficiency. It is our aim to achieve a 75% saving compared to a base case cooler. The market opportunity will be worth at least \u20ac700 million per annum in Europe alone. In order to exploit our development we will introduce a radically new business model that will allow equipment owners and users to share the benefits of energy savings.

Our chilled vending sector is heavily based on older HFC refrigerant technology.  In contrast Japan has embraced natural refrigerants and is the leading manufacturer of CO2 and HC vending machines. As a result, our industry needs to innovate and develop advanced components and systems, to remain competitive and provide cost effective, energy efficient products. Small refrigeration systems as used in vending machines use capillaries as the expansion device, however they do not enable optimal operation over the range of refrigeration loads. Away from design point load, coefficient of performance drops due to sub-optimal filling of the evaporator. More advanced control systems may be introduced by replacing the capiliary with an expansion valve, however for refrigeration systems in the 50-250W capacity they are challenging to manufacture cost effectively, due to small orifice sizes. As a result the Expand project will develop a low cost expansion device for HC and CO2 refrigerants together with a control system that  will enable efficient modulation of refrigeration system capacity in relation to load.  This will enable cumulative energy consumption savings of 25% for the cooler in relation to present HFC systems, thus regaining a technological lead for the European vending industry.

Despite stringent health & safety standards over 50% of UK road workers reported a near miss with a vehicle and the large majority of injuries or fatalities occur within designated safety areas. These safe zones are either protected by positive protection systems such as concrete barriers or soft barriers such as traffic cones. The latter are mainly used for temporary works. In such a scenario cones may be the only protection a road worker has from traffic. Due to the maturity of Europe\u2019s road network and the rapid deterioration as a result of heavy traffic and weather conditions, temporary road work is increasing. In addition to concerns about safety, preparation of these temporary barriers is a major drain on resources. As a lot of roadwork is carried out at night, barriers are equipped with lanterns. These are typically powered by disposable batteries which only last a short period of time and have to be changed frequently. The Safelane consortium have successfully developed  a wireless perimeter protection system that detects an impact to a temporary barrier. However,  there are several significant technical hurdles that currently prevent the development of a system that can be applied to every road maintenance scenario. In Safelane we propose to develop an all-encompassing system including; a Smart re-chargeable lantern battery with integrated wireless impact sensor; a Smart alarm base station capable of receiving alerts from individual impact sensors, to warn the workforce; and a device management system enabling road maintenance contractors to effectively manage temporary work sites via a web based graphical user interface.

A growth in single occupancy, an increase in multi-dwelling buildings (flats) and a fall in household floor space have all driven an increase in the purchase of combined washer-dryers, growing at 9% p.a.\n\nHowever, washer-dryers are inefficient, using as much as 50% more energy to wash and dry a load than separate systems. This is a concern both for energy consumption and cost for the user - estimated 15 million washer-dryers consume 18 TWh of electricity worth \u20ac300m and indirectly emit 10,000 tonnes of CO2 each year. As well as energy efficiency, washer-dryers also have practical limitations. Due to the small drum size of the machine compared to a dedicated tumble dryer, it is not possible to dry a full wash load in one go, adding to cost and significantly reducing convenience.\n\nLoWash will address these issues by creating a highly energy-efficient machine capable drying a complete wash load without user intervention. It will achieve this by combing an innovative hydraulic load balancing drum with a unique passive/active heat pump drying chain to create a washer-dryer capable of washing and drying a complete 7kg load without removing any of it from the machine. It will do this using <50% of the energy required by current washer dryers.\n\nRealising this vision would provide a \u20ac34m market opportunity to our consortium for washer-dryers.
