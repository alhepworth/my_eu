These plays will be created by young people between the ages of 14 and 19, who will research, improvise, using theatre techniques and eventually script two plays, that will be performed at local community level by its originators. Some of these young people are from circumstances that offer them fewer opportunities than their peers, from both youth theatres. Approximately 50 young people will be involved. The plays will then  be exchanged and performed by the other youth theatre, performed to the public and watched by the originators via live feed. There will be a live debate followed by an evaluation process. It is expected that the methodologies of both processes will be slightly different, though both theatre based through workshops, according to the style of the two leaders. It is hoped to address issues around prejudice and discrimination deriving from post war attitudes, enabling greater freedom and inter-nation trust and confidence through an empathetic process of stepping into each other's plays and speaking with each other's voices. The plays will be e-published and made available to other youth theatres in Ireland and the UK for performance and sent on to stakeholders for consideration as testament to the young people's views and current attitudes.", "http://www.junkshoptheatre.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IE01-KA205-000337_1"]]}}}}
