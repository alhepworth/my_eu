In the EU, regulations to protect animals during transport are laid down in Council Regulation 1/2005. Due to the small profit margins in the pig industry, however, improving pig welfare must go hand in hand with economic benefits to get a sustainable solution. This poses a challenge to all parties involved in the logistic chain, many of whom are SMEs. TRANSUS proposes a revolutionary new concept for the groupwise transport of pigs, i.e. to use the concept of standardized container transport, taking into account animal welfare and hygiene requirements. An easy-to-handle, stackable, transport container enables cost-effective transport of slaughter pigs (circa 10 pigs/container) from farm to slaughterhouse, because (a) (un)loading of individual pigs can be done without the (expensive) lorry being present (only (un)loading of containers is necessary and can be done by a standard forklift truck), (b) once in the container, the pigs do not need to be handled individually until they are ready for further processing at the slaughterhouse (stress reduction in the pigs), (c) cleaning of empty containers can be done offline, and (d) the containers can be developed in a modular way, allowing optimised designs for expected group sizes, logistic handling at the farm and at the slaughterhouse, and cleaning/disinfection. Although in essence the transport container is suitable for SMEs to develop and manufacture, the total mix of requirements and logistic procedures in the pig meat industry, necessitates application research. The R&amp;D activities have been organised in a number of work packages and will be carried out in close collaboration between SME and RTD participants, with activities as system specifications, pig welfare research, development of the transport container, trials and assessments, and elaboration on ways of exploitation.", 131499.0, 1355955.0, 6, 13, "TRANSUS", "http://transus.net/", "http://www.quality-equipment.co.uk", null, "fp7_97639_984498106"]]}}, "9UP": {"cordis": {"data": [[1257033600000, 1377907200000, "Ambulatory Magneto-Enhancement of Transdermal High Yield Silver Therapy", "Pulse Medical Technologies Limited", "There are approximately 2 million people  who suffer from chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers in Europe at the present time. These wounds typically take between 12 and 24 weeks to heal, but 30% take over two years. This represents a cost to the European healthcare services of at least \u20ac8 billion  a year in treatment. Two thirds of cases are released immediately for treatment in the community, and it is common for 40% of community nurses\u2019 time to be taken up by the management, dressing and care of this type of wound.  In addition to the above, one of the reasons behind the phenomenon of antibiotic resistant bacteria is the widespread use of medication when there is no clinical infection. If low level silver ion dressings could be used in prophylaxis instead of antibiotics there would be an additional saving in terms of the cost of treating patients who contract antibiotic resistant infections. More importantly the incidence of antibiotic resistance will be lower.  Current wound treatments are either expensive, inadequate or dangerous. Our idea provides a way of enhancing the effectiveness of silver-containing dressings used in the treatment of ulcers by creating a pulsed electromagnetic field at the wound site by the incorporation of a pulsed electromagnetic element in a low silver dressing. The pulsed electromagnetic field increases the concentration of silver ions available to the wound bed margin.   The device is designed to be worn by patients in their every-day lives without the need to attend a medical facility for treatment. The system consists of two distinct components \u2013 an electronic pulse generator and an electromagnetic component contained in a disposable surgical dressing which is impregnated with silver-containing nanoparticles.", 213172.0, 906682.0, 6, 10, "AMETHYST", null, "http://www.pulsemedical.co.uk", null, "fp7_107635_996283509"], [1514764800000, 1688083200000, "MW Fuel Cell micro grid and district heating at King\u2019s Cross", "Buuk Infrastructure No 2 Limited", "ELECTROU will install the first MW fuel cell in Europe fully integrated into a building at the high profile redevelopment at Kings Cross, London. This includes the full use of power & heat generated by the fuel cell within the local building, the site wide heat, power and cooling networks, and extends to water re-use and support of the micro grid.\n\nELECTROU will prove that the multi-MW installation due to operational efficiency and negligible emissions will massively improve local and EU wide carbon emission targets. Designed to be an outdoor installation the plant will be adapted to indoor requirements e.g. space, ventilation, and safe access and egress. Up-scaling more than 3 times the installed capacity compared to current indoor installations is a critical step for large scale deployment within building applications.\n\nThe use of fuel cells in this critical sector is currently prevented due to the high spatial requirements of multiple smaller modules, high capital cost compared to other technologies, and complexity of integration. ELECTROU will break all of these barriers. The project will demonstrate to key decision makers, investors and financiers that there is a near term route to produce electricity and heat in a highly efficient way by a technology which is commercially viable today.\n\nELECTROU will prove through funding support that multi-MW installations within buildings can make an investment grade return without the need for any form of local or EU subsidy, this is a critical step in making the sector viable. A targeted dissemination campaign will be performed to share all of the results with stakeholders and the general public that promotes the technical, commercial and environmental benefits of this mature but high tech technology. We will develop one valid process for all fuel cell installations in Europe by supporting the set-up of simplified regulations, codes and standards that as a result will positively influence market entry throughout the EU.", 79300.0, 9001533.0, 3, 6, "ELECTROU", null, null, null, "h2020_212590_925834640"]]}}}}
