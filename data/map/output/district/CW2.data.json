It is made up of 23 VET programmes belonging to 18 vocational fields.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at meeting the needs of its members, in particular:\r\n-Modernize the schools and boost the appeal and quality of their Intermediate VET \r\n-Acquire the necessary skills to implement the dual learning apprenticeship model\r\n-Initiate or consolidate internationalization \r\n-Incorporate the European dimension in the curriculum\r\n-Improve the participant\u2019s global competences \r\n-Ameliorate key competences in students and boost professional competence in teachers.\r\n\r\nThese needs would translate into the following project objectives:  Contribute to lowering school drop out rates. Diversify the educational offering of the dual learning apprenticeship model. Give educational institutions a global dimension while fostering transnational mobility. Raise employability of Intermediate VET graduates and increase the number of students going on to study Higher VET.\r\n\r\nWith a means to achieve these objectives, two types of mobilities are being considered:\r\n- Mobility of 74 students to take their 5 week on-the-job training in companies in Germany, UK, Italy and Finland \r\n- Mobility of 44 CFGM teachers and members of the Department for Education, with a view to do job shadowing for the dual learning apprenticeship model in Germany the United Kingdom and Findland.\r\n \r\nIn order to make these mobilities a reality, there are 11 European VET shools acting as partners, all of them of considerable size, with international experience and most of them with previous experience of cooperation with the Department for Education. Agreements are celebrated for the exchange of teachers and students. The latter will be sent for internships to the companies with which agreements have been entered. The students will be also mentored by the VET institutions at their destination. The cooperation consists of visits, phone calls and emails.\r\n\r\nParticipants are selected at each educational institution, following a call and based on specific common criteria. Each school takes care of preparing for the visit on different dimensions: pedagogical, cultural, health and safety, trips, protection, etc. This preparation can also be done in cooperation with other schools be it a face to face cooperation or via the Moodle platform created to this effect. The students use the OLS and specific language courses,  and an online course is created for the staff at the Department for education. All participants sign learning agreements/work programs before the mobility takes place. \r\n\r\nThe sending institutions in close cooperation with the host partners organize travel arrangement, lodging and boarding, insurance, and offer the necessary advice to obtain the necessary documentation.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of skills and its communication to members is done using Europass and national instruments (credits for teacher training, recognition of on-the-job training hours, certificate of participation).\r\n\r\nThe assessment plan includes the proposal, methodology, learning results, impact, objectives, dissemination and statistics. It includes questionnaires and/or statistics analysis from the Department of Education and it caters for contingencies or poor quality of activities. \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes are: \r\n-Increased interest by teachers on European projects \r\n-Growing number of institutions offering the dual learning apprenticeship model; \r\n-Improvement in management of transnational mobility\r\n-Better academic outcomes \r\n-Network creation; \r\n-Decrease in early school leaving rates\r\n-Changes in the Administration to facilitate these projects and their participation in KA2 and KA3;\r\n-Awareness of institutions and regional companies. \r\n\r\nThe impact is measured with numerical indicators calculated from statistical data and questionnaires.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination plan  and achieved results disseminates on traditional, social media and on the Web: the assignment and results of the project, the experiences of participants (reports on the website, dual VET educational sessions); sessions about organization of mobility in Erasmus + FP projects; debriefings to potential participants; hosting of  foreign participants; electronic posting at the end of the project with the results and experiences of participants.

This means that most of our students are disadvantaged in terms of experiences abroad and therefore have little awareness of how today's local and national plans are intrinsically linked to a European horizon. Ok School Academy is therefore investing much of its energy in training professionals of the beauty sector, not only able to be high quality work holders, but also to create through innovation. Vocational education and training in the field of wellness is called to a difficult task: training young people to enter the labor market in 3/4 years. Due to a lack of time, the focus is often on practical learning rather than the development of more complex processes (soft skills, problem-solving, developing of a proactive mindset) that would allow the students to acquire real marketable competences.The increase of economical standards and a different relationship between leisure and work time have fostered the growth and evolution of the wellness sector. Today in Brescia and Lombardia the sector mainly includes individual or micro enterprises with 1 or 2 employees, very often related to a localized market. Workers are required to possess proper competences to cover the entire range of available services. Sector growth with more and specific demands and the increasing competition with the arrival on the market of new entrepreneurs (especially Chinese) causes the need for an organization development with prospects for growth both in size and in the specialization and valorization of workers.The new consumption patterns highlight the trend of customers to deal with a single supplier for the satisfaction of an integrated set of requirements; in order to accommodate the growing demand for \"integrated\" services it is essential to train the new professional resources in a proper way, aiming at complementing traditional technical skills with cross and management competences useful for the full participation of workers in business strategies.Through Erasmus+ 50 students and 8 teachers will be able to observe the wellness market,  in 2017-18, in two countries, UK and France, considered as leading countries in hairdressing and beauty, going through innovation processes.The participants will carry out 3 weeks internships, supported and guided by the partner organizations, South Cheshire College in the UK and the Regional Chamber of Crafts and Small Enterprises of the Midi-Pyrenees in France.Another project partner is Cooperativa Tempo Libero of Brescia, whose cooperation concerns the pre-departure training and the evaluation phase of the skills acquired by the students.Thanks to the project, the students will develop, in line with their curriculum, an attitude that will ensure more employment opportunities both in Brescia and in the entire European system. Thanks to the comparison with a professional and cultural context different from their usual one, the students will strengthen their methodological approach, increasing that openness necessary for learning to learn and for the flexibility required by today's labor market.

The Technical School for Mechanical Engineering in Mindelheim seeks to fulfil this demand by offeringstudents an education which will enable them to gain these skills.\r\n\r\nSecondly, global energy and climate problems make the participation in this project even more important. Energy issues are in focus all over the world and there is an enormous potential for saving energy. Our technicians will definitely be involved with energy efficiency measures and will have contact to foreign suppliers or customers in and outside their home country in the course of their future careers. This is why it is so important to enable our students, through this mobility project, to gain experience of finding new solutions through the exchange of knowledge and the development of their problem-solving skills with people from other countries. \r\n\r\nBy staying in a foreign country with a different culture the pupils will not only get practical work experience but will also be confronted with technical problems in a foreign language. In addition, they will have the chance to improve and consolidate their foreign language skills (listening, reading, speaking and writing). Furthermore, staying in another country for a while will increase their intercultural awareness and encourage them to communicate with people who speak a different language and have a different culture from their own. \r\nWithin the scope of the project the attention of the pupils will be drawn to the challenges which can occur when carrying out a (professional) project in which there are participants from other countries or when taking part in a project in another country. At the same time, their (energy) technical knowledge will be consolidated and they will learn how to find and present energy efficiency solutions and measures. \r\nAdditionally, the participants from both sides should become more conscious of energy issues which will strengthen their feelings of responsibility for our common environment. In this way, permanent partnerships for future projects can be cemented, the results can be passed on to third parties and others will be encouraged to do the same. \r\n\r\nThe project participants have all completed a certified vocational training as well as at least one year of practical work experience. The Technical College offers its pupils a diverse vocational education which includes professional training (general education subjects and specialist subjects) as well as the chance to gain key qualifications. All the participants also acquire the training supervisor certificate as part of their technical training at the school. For this, they are required to take part in a 40-hour energy efficiency course certified by the German Chamber of Commerce for which they must pass a final exam. \r\n\r\nAt first, the participants will do a week\u2019s intensive course in English in the partner country including an examination at the end of the course.

The South Cheshire College came up with a solid training programme proposal that meets the expectations of the EPAL MO.\r\n\r\nProject Objectives\r\nIt is envisaged that the training programme will have many viable outcomes such as:\r\n- improved learning performance through being introduced to different learning/teaching methods.\r\n- enhanced employability, as the inclusion of the programme on the individual participant's europass cv will be attractive to potential employers.\r\n- improved language competency, due to the immerse nature of the programme design.\r\n- enhanced awareness of different cultures, again due to the full immersion of each participant into UK college life.\r\n- improved learning performance, both in the vocational area, but also due to the wider enrichment programme on offer, in particular, the utilisation of sport and physical activity as a means of encouraging participants to strive and a\r\nThe programme, with the additional benefit of sport and physical activity, aims to promote and develop other facets of college life and experience, such as school attendance and leadership. \r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants\r\nThe students of the EPAL Markopoulou-Oropou are 16-19 years of age. Many of them come from families of migrant workers mainly from Balkan countries. As with the teachers, it was the YouthActiv programme that triggered their interest and intention to see more of Europe. So they asked their teachers to investigate the possibilities of their mobility in a European country for training purposes.\r\nGiven that there are senior students interested in participating in the mobility programme the School will look at offering to up to eight graduate students the opportunity to join the mobility group.\r\nThere will be 30 student participants and 3 accompanying persons participating in the mobility action.\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities\r\nThe training programme focuses around the vocational specialisms of the students. Half of their weekly programme will be based on their vocational field of either business/finance, ICT, Engineering or Electrical. This provision will span several delivery platforms including underpinning knowledge, practical experience, self reflection, project work and appropriate industrial visits/experiences.\r\n\r\nThe remaining half of their programme is designed to enrich the learning experience of the students and will operate according to the following delivery areas.\r\n- Cultural Training - including a bespoke language programme, and specific cultural provision to enhance and reinforce cultural learning\r\n- Sports activity - a well known method of overcoming barriers to learning and increasing the confidence of learners, this will be a vital part of the programme. Learners will be offered the chance to take part in many physical activities, designed to enhance their programme. South Cheshire College has excellent sporting facilities including an all weather multi use games pitch, and a fully equipped indoor sporting venue, which includes a state of the art indoor climbing wall.\r\n\r\nImpact Envisaged\r\nBesides the objectives described above the partnership strongly believes that this learning experience as a whole will open \"new horizons\" for as students in terms of their employability and their mobility potential in the European Union, especially during this period of the financial crisis our country is dealing with, which has significantly narrowed the chances to get employed.\r\n\r\nPotential Longer Term Benefits\r\nThe successful implementation of the project may enhance the intention for mobility of individuals, not just students and teachers, but also young people, youth workers, volunteers and civil society organisations of the local community.", "http://www.scc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-EL01-KA102-000541_1"], [2017, "Reflektive Praxis w\u00e4hrend der Ausbildung zur/m Erzieher/in in europ\u00e4ischen Kindertagesst\u00e4tten", "South Cheshire College", 60053.0, 3, 5, "The project will be put in practice in colleges and day-care centers.

The project participants have all completed a certified vocational training as well as at least one year of practical work experience. The Technical College offers its pupils a diverse vocational education which includes professional training (general education subjects and specialist subjects) as well as the chance to gain key qualifications. All the participants also acquire the training supervisor certificate as part of their technical training at the school. For this, they are required to take part in a 40-hour energy efficiency course certified by the German Chamber of Commerce for which they must pass a final exam. At first, the participants will do a week\u2019s intensive course in English in the partner country including an examination at the end of the course. This course will also provide them with the necessary technical terms. During the second week of the participants\u2019 stay in the UK it is planned to carry out an \u201cEnergy Efficiency Day\u201d for different classes at the host school. This will be based on the knowledge the students gained from their last action/measure which was the creation of an energy efficiency catalogue. The participants will plan, organise and afterwards evaluate this action. A variety of activities relating to the cooperation with the SCC college students, facility management staff, administration staff and the college management will be necessary for the preparation of this action/measure and all kinds of conversational situations in the foreign language, English, will evolve. The German participants, divided into small groups, will be responsible for introducing a variety of energy efficiency-related topics at different workstations and they will organise activities which should take place at different, topic-related places at the school.Afterwards, the participants' results from the individual days will be collected, evaluated and recorded in a written report which will be presented to the SCC college management. This will not only give the German technology students the opportunity to practice their technical English and help them to consolidate their energy efficiency knowledge but will also put them in the role of a trainer which are all important skills for their future careers. By publishing and widely distributing the project results, we hope to be able to make a contribution towards more public awareness of the worldwide problem - climate change.

The school has 345 students in 11 national programs and the introduction program. A third of our students come from a country other than Sweden and no less than 29 nationalities are represented at our school.  Our school values international contacts high and our goal is that all students at some point during their time at the school have had an international contact or have participated in international cooperation, and the school also works to increase the number of employees involved in international activities and to implement this to all the  programs of the school. It is therefore seen as essential to participate in job shadowing or attend courses abroad. The school has been awarded \"School for Sustainable Development\". As part of keeping the award and to have sustainable development as an \"umbrella\" of all our activities, it is important that more people acquire   a better understanding of what sustainable development, and Education for Sustainable Development, is and how to work with these issues in the classroom to create active citizens outside the classroom. With the large number of students from other countries, it is also important that our teachers learn methods and tools that create good learning environments for all students in an intercultural classroom.\r\n\r\nWe want to implement job shadowing and courses in Europe to:\r\n\u2022 Increase the skills and quality of our teaching so that pupils' results improve.\r\n\u2022 learn new tools and methods to teach in the intercultural classroom as well as in the \"traditional\" and to develop teaching methods and approaches.\r\n\u2022 Improve the leadership and organization.\r\n\u2022 Be able to integrate sustainable development and ESD (Education for Sustainable Development) in our subjects and our various programs.\r\n\u2022 Acquire new perspectives on teaching and on the organization as well as new knowledge and to translate it into practical action.\r\n\u2022Obtain knowledge of schools in other countries for increased mobility of our students in the future.\r\n\u2022 To increase the international contact network for the participants.\r\n\u2022To accomplish a better integration and increased knowledge and understanding of different cultures in our school and in our community.\r\n\r\nWe are seeking job shadow placement in Crewe, United Kingdom for 10 people.

Those who want to go on one of the two courses in this project will be selected on the basis of a written application, which must justify why they want to participate and how they intend to disseminate and implement their knowledge and experiences in and outside our organization. Participants will be given the time to implement the tasks sent out before the course and to prepare information materials to inform other students and colleagues in Crewe. The expected outcome of the project is that we have employees, various tools and methods for working with students from many different countries in the intercultural classroom, with sustainable development, quality improvement methods in terms of teaching and learning, leadership and organization. Another result is a major international network that we can work with in other contexts.

The Technical School for Mechanical Engineering in Mindelheim seeks to fulfil this demand by offeringstudents an education which will enable them to gain these skills.\r\n\r\nSecondly, global energy and climate problems make the participation in this project even more important. Energy issues are in focus all over the world and there is an enormous potential for saving energy. Our technicians will definitely be involved with energy efficiency measures and will have contact to foreign suppliers or customers in and outside their home country in the course of their future careers. This is why it is so important to enable our students, through this mobility project, to gain experience of finding new solutions through the exchange of knowledge and the development of their problem-solving skills with people from other countries. \r\n\r\nBy staying in a foreign country with a different culture the pupils will not only get practical work experience but will also be confronted with technical problems in a foreign language. In addition, they will have the chance to improve and consolidate their foreign language skills (listening, reading, speaking and writing). Furthermore, staying in another country for a while will increase their intercultural awareness and encourage them to communicate with people who speak a different language and have a different culture from their own. \r\nWithin the scope of the project the attention of the pupils will be drawn to the challenges which can occur when carrying out a (professional) project in which there are participants from other countries or when taking part in a project in another country. At the same time, their (energy) technical knowledge will be consolidated and they will learn how to find and present energy efficiency solutions and measures. \r\nAdditionally, the participants from both sides should become more conscious of energy issues which will strengthen their feelings of responsibility for our common environment.

In the second week small mixed groups of students will work on energy-efficient measures at and with our partners. This will include the complete chain of action of an energy consultation from the identifying the problem, carrying out measures to evaluating the results, calculating energy efficiency measures and the presentation of the results. The target is to create and present a catalogue of energy efficiency measures.\r\nBack in Mindelheim, the results will be summarized in a comprehensive report and the consumption values of our partners compared with ours. These will be communicated on both sides in both countries and should encourage a sustainable further development in other organisations too. The findings/comparative values collected during the project will also be dealt with in lessons at school and addressed further, by means of various media, to companies, schools, environmental organisations as well as various other multipliers. The project report, created, will be published and will be included in the evaluation of the school marks. The course contents will also be part of the school lessons of the partner organisation and any energy efficiency measurements which have been proved to be viable will be promptly put into practice.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it is intended that the Mindelheim group plays a leading role as energy consultants apart from passing on the knowledge they have attained during their energy efficiency course to the pupils of their partner facility.

We want to  develop an educational method based on the cooperative work that facillitates teamwork and interdisciplinary.The main objectives are:Increasing student motivation through the implementation of new active methodologies.Co-working which involves reflecting on cooperation and respect for the rules.Introducing European values in the school's activities.Achieving integration of all students through a division of labor according to the capabilities of each.Increasing students' confidence in their own abilities to perform the tasks assigned.Improving the academic performance of students.Improving and enhancing our ability to work together by sharing good teaching practices.Reaching agreement on common strategies for the acquisition of key competencies.Motivating the learning of foreign languages through the implementation and display of a common project.Promoting the use of ICT, both for individual and group tasks, either  at home or in the classsroom  through its use during the project with a communicative approach. Improving the communicative competence of teachers in  the use of English as a tool to understand he different cultures that make up the European Union.We have looked for partners who have the same concerns and seek a collaborative approach to implement in their schools.The teaching staff and the School Board have approved the project and have given their explicit support to the proposed activities. The project actively involves members of the management team, the head of the  extra curricular department, and  a good number of teachers  from different departments of which 4 are Teacher representatives in the School Council. The profile of the participants includes teachers with a high degree of involvement in  the  school's projects  and an extensive career.The  mobility activities proposed are two training courses, one in the UK and one in the Netherlands, and two Job Shadowing activities, one in the UK and  the other one in Italy.   We propose the mobility for 8 teacherss, 4 in each year of the project. The training courses listed are related to new methodologies, which are meant to work the social and civic competences, digital literacy and competence of learning to learn from a multidisciplinary approach.The expected impact is to achieve a change in how to apply methodological strategies, so that our school becomes an inclusive, collaborative one which can  facilitate the learning process.We want to transform the traditional educational framework : \"a classroom, a teacher\"; allowing other teachers to attend our lessons, so that we can learn from each others and so enrich ourselves by new experiences in our own school.We intend to learn from other European institutions with similar projects and we hope that the involvement of the rest of the staff will grow.  We  firmily believe   these measures help to  improve  our student's learning outcomes as well as will increase  a school environment that facilitates the implementation of new projects.", "http://www.scc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-023700_1"]]}}}}
