During the first year of the project we will elaborate and than adopt methods and improve existing good practices and programmes which are effective in reaching community aims for social excluded people in the 4 key areas selected during the phase of project design ( Community building, Education, Training and Employability, Eco-Sustainability, Housing). After the analysis of study cases, at the beginning of the second year of project, technical expert of the project who participate in Study Visits will elaborate a Tool Box, containing  transferable good practices selected during study visits. This will help in the creation of a public web platform to be considered as an important tool for all those professional working in this field. We'd want this Platform to be an open space for all European Communities working with social excluded people in order to add their projects and good practices in the web and help professionals all around Europe to get a deep vision on key effective activities in community work.During the second year we will organize 2 courses: one about Community Innovative management, community self end eco-sustainability; and another on transferable methodologies on Empowerment - adult education in literacy, ICT basic skills, employability...).

Crucial in this is the lack of appropriate outcome measures that can robustly identify patient benefit from a specific therapy. The lack of specific and sensitive endpoints to differentiate between responders and non-responders both at the level of pain and tissue structure modification (disease modifying OA drug: DMOAD) has led to trials that included hundreds of patients in each arm with at least 3-years follow-up. Even despite these enormous trials, EMA and FDA have not approved any DMOAD yet. There is a general lack of understanding OA pathogenesis, which appears rather variable and likely reflecting different phenotypes with fundamental differences in disease aetiology, tissue alterations, clinical manifestations (pain/mobility) and disease progression. Although the current mind-set for drug treatment in the field is moving to a more personalized medicine and patient stratification approach, there are no accepted methods or guidelines to classify patients according to their prognosis and differentiate between subsets in terms of diagnosis methodology and treatment plan. The APPROACH consortium brings together a competent and multidisciplinary group of stakeholders that will setup \u2013 for the first time \u2013 a longitudinal cohort based on highly innovative stratification methods that identifies different OA phenotypes and subsequently develop guidelines for differentially diagnosing the right patient for the right treatment.\n\nThe stratified medicine APPROACH \nThe APPROACH consortium brings together a unique complimentary set of skills to develop, validate and link biomarkers with biological processes and clinical end points in OA patient subsets. This will support future regulatory qualification and guide clinical trials for relevant endpoint validation, thereby paving the road for stratified or personalized medicine.

Yet, English Language Teachers (ELTs) cannot deliver professional results if they are not sufficiently trained in the area of LTA. Unfortunately, research has shown that in many educational systems across Europe, ELTs are unable to create good quality assessment materials and procedures. This is at least partly because they are not sufficiently trained in the area of LTA: the lack of what has been termed as 'assessment literacy'. Given the current state of affairs, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient, relevant, scalable and sustainable LTA training infrastructure for ELTs, which can eventually be of benefit to other language teachers as well. \r\nConsisting of a network of experts from five different European countries (Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Germany and the UK), the Teachers\u2019 Assessment Literacy Enhancement (TALE) project will build on a solid identification of LTA training needs of pre- and in-service English Language Teachers in order to provide a training ecosystem that will cater for these needs. \r\nOverall,  the TALE project will contribute towards: \r\n- the development of innovative training materials and services, that will be delivered through traditional face-to-face and online learning and offered through synchronous and asynchronous modes for the enhancement of the required LTA skills and competencies. The proposed training ecosystem will offer continuous support and mentoring to teachers in the respective countries.\r\n- the expansion and the exchange of LTA expertise between European educational contexts in a creative and innovative way\r\n-  the cooperation between and within different disciplines, e.g. education (foreign/second language teaching and testing, assessment literacy, Content and Language Integrated Learning assessment and eLearning/distance education) and various sectors of training and the workplace in order to foster efficient and meaningful assessments suitable for all types of language learners in primary and secondary education. \r\n- the synchronization and harmonization of foreign language teacher training and assessment practices in the field of LTA in Europe and beyond. \r\nThe training endeavor will follow three main phases. The first phase involves needs analysis which will be achieved through a comprehensive literature review on current thinking in language assessment literacy and an extensive consultation with ELTs to ensure that the new course will meet their needs. The results of this phase will be used as input in the next phase. The second phase will involve the development and piloting of the online training materials and services.  During piloting,  feedback mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that the stakeholders will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the training course. The feedback will be given due consideration and revisions will be made accordingly. Once the project partners have worked with and refined the materials and the evaluation process is complete, the Handbook of Language Teaching and Assessment will be drafted, refined, piloted and finally published to enable and promote wider implementation of the project beyond the partner organisations.

Nevertheless, confronted with these challenges, many educators have developed a unique know-how and expertise on the field. These empirical practices, often tacit and informal, would be a unique resource for other professionals confronted elsewhere with the same challenges.\r\n\r\nTherefore, our project offers an original solution for capitalizing on these good practices developed locally in Europe: one of building, at the European level and over time, an active community of field professionals (practitioners) and researchers (theorists of professional practices) to exchanges experiences and knowledge relating to the educational support of UMs.\r\n\r\nOver the two years of the project, close to 60 youth workers (educators, social workers) and researchers will get together, during four work sessions of 5 days each in France, Italy, Germany and Greece.\r\n\r\nAll sessions will use the methodology of the \u201ccommunity of practices and knowledge\u201d, which will enable the participants to share their knowledge gained from experience, cross them with theoretical knowledge and to extract lessons learned.

By developing an entrepreneurial mind set, participants will be able to see the potential for their own businesses.  This project therefore seeks to help develop job opportunities for the participants by developing their own businesses but also anticipates that the participants themselves will eventually provide job opportunities for others.  Work-based entrepreneurial training will provide participants with real life experience of the process to developing new businesses. Furthermore, as the consortium has previously identified, a common theme for those in the short food supply chain is that they feel isolated and VET courses of this nature will help to foster new relationships and thus expand networks for participants and ultimately supply support.  \u2018Creating Entrepreneurs in Food\u2019 is the first project to propose creating bespoke vocational education and training in the area of entrepreneurship aimed at those in the short food supply chain.

We want to popularize this method among a wider audience of educators, students, parents, and scientists; to spread its use to more countries, more schools, and more teachers; and to expose more children and more parents to learning using this methodology. This objective is based on the belief that our current primary and secondary education systems may no longer be fit for purpose for the rapidly changing world in which we live, and in a Europe that needs to create jobs, innovate, and become more socially and commercially entrepreneurial.The origins of the project are based on current Children\u2019s University (FUD) practice which requires children to attend Universities or other venues to come face-to-face with the scientists and academics who provide lessons dealing with complex subjects in a simple way. We plan to overcome the limitations of this approach by creating training for teacher and exchange of good practices between the partner organizations to foster innovation.  1400 teachers will receive a product of these exchange in a form of innovative Teachers' Materials (Teachers' Boxes). They will also have an access to Teachers' Community of Practice to learn from each other and to stimulate their personal and professional development.The ultimate aim is to change the education system and produce more adults who are innovative and entrepreneurial. Since this isn\u2019t possible to measure during the project we will measure the effect of the lessons amongst pupils, teachers, parents, and lesson contributors according to three criteria: Interest, Engagement, and Satisfaction.
