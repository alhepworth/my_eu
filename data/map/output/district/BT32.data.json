It is envisaged that through the medium of art pupils will develop a deeper understanding of their own cultural but of also the rich variety of cultures and diversity found within Europe.The partnership was developed through the use of the E-Twinning partner finding service, personal friendships and links that had been previously developed. Together we devised an acronym for our project, @Museart. This acronym summarised our thoughts that the project would involve museums, art, technology but also amusement and fun to facilitate an exciting and challenging project. The target aims of this project are to improve achievement in relevant and high-level basic and transversal competencies in a lifelong learning perspective through the promotion of art as a universal means of learning and communication. This will be an inclusive project that involves all members of school communities regardless of ethnicity, socio-economic background or academic achievement. We aim to strengthen the profiles of our teachers by sharing the variety of excellent, didactic practice within our European Community of schools. Our aims are:To enrich our culture by experiencing the main artistic places of each community and exploring the different cultures, traditions and places associated with art and creativity. We will use art as a means of developing curriculum material to enhance the life skills and competencies of the students. Through increased motivation the children will be able to enhance a wide range of life-long learning skills such as literacy, numeracy, ICT and an appreciation for aesthetic beauty. To address inclusion within our project we will use art as a means of inclusion for all our children. Art allows all children to express their talents through a variety of media.To strengthen the profile of teachers we will improve their cultural knowledge, share innovative teaching methodologies, exchange excellent practice and provide learning opportunities and cultural stimuli. The project involves 9 schools from 8 different countries around Europe. The schools serve a wide variety of socio-economic communities and a wide variety of ethnic diversity.The designed activities will empower the European citizens of tomorrow with the knowledge, abilities and attitudes vital to create a society that appreciates the unique artistic differences between cultures and backgrounds.  The dimension of communication and language skill development is a natural progression and project activities will provide scope for much creativity and innovation. In order to have sustainable impact this project has the focus of sharing and developing staff practice whilst still addressing key areas identified as European priorities and in individual schools.

Four schools (from Italy, Great Britain, Romania and Spain) found a common topic to work together. We all share the working spirit needed to develop the project. We thought that working on ICT, sports and communication would be a great idea. But what could be nicer than working out all that by using the root of our traditions? So we have the objectives clear:- We want our students to develop the necessary communicative skills to communicate with people from other countries.- The students have to be able to communicate and work using ICT.- They have to manage the different platforms to work on the project.- They will have to play traditional games and make an effort to play them properly.- They will have to be conscious of the different cultures and people living in the E.U.- The staff in all schools need to improve their language and digital skills in order to develop proper and innovative teaching.- The teachers and institutions will have to accomplish the terms and conditions adopted in the project.- We all want to learn from our peers, students and the experiences.There will be a group of 1000 students (from 3 to 15 years old) involved directly in the project, they have been selected because they have to fit the characteristics of this project. The groups from every country will be heterogeneous, so there will be a variety of students working on the activities proposed. Some of them live in big cities, whereas others live in small towns in rural areas. This is an important aspect as everyone of them will contribute with their personal experiences.The activities and methodology will be the following:- Exchanging emails, that means writing and reading.- Chatting by using video calls, listening and speaking.- Explaining and recording how the traditional games are played in the different countries.- Playing the different games from the different countries.- Exercising in a different way in order to keep and motivate them to be fit.- Using ICT tools to develop strategic skills and improving language communication by using a foreign language. - Learning about the culture, geographical situation, language...of all partners.We expect to achieve the following results and benefits in the long run:-Better preparation of teachers to their teaching career.-Improvement of all competences by the students: linguistic, digital, social...-Deeper knowledge of the European reality.-Consciousness of the importance of being fit through all our life.-Building a bridge between past and the future generations in order to take advantage of the knowledge and traditions.-Being able to cooperate with others and to create your own future labour career.-Exploiting all the full potential that students and people have.The impact we expect to attain is based on personal achievements and global improvements in the areas where this is implemented.First of all, both students and teachers will obtain several benefits after the project. For instance, better command of the English language and digital tools, a more active implication in the educational and social community, a deeper awareness of the importance of keeping fit, a more comprehensive knowledge about our traditions and an exhaustive familiarity about the European reality and its cultural and linguistic richness. In addition, the project will mainly cause a positive impact on the students and the whole community around as it will reinforce their transversal capacities which are a key point in the future life career as they are really valued by employers worldwide. These students will manage better to cope in different situations and they will have less probability to suffer unemployment thanks to all the knowledge and experiences acquired. This is one of the reasons we decided to do mobilities: they are very important to achieve some of the competences we expect our students to achieve, which will also very helpful for their future curriculum and motivation to carry out Erasmus projects.All the partners will make a good use of the realization and dissemination of the project in order that our European colleagues realise of the importance of working cooperatively to achieve any objective that can help to improve our students' skills and competences.", "http://www.stmarysbanbridge.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA219-025205_3"]]}}, "3HA": {"esif": {"data": [[1388534400000, 1609459200000, "Work Routes", "REED IN PARTNERSHIP", null, "ESF", 343620.0, 859050.0, "esf_ni_107"]]}}, "3QD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Streetfood: Opportunities for Regions", "Banbridge District Enterprises Ltd", 216573.0, 4, 6, "The street food sector is growing fast: NCASS registered 700 new street food businesses last year alone and our partners witness rapidly growing sectors with rising demand for support from young entrepreneurs.  Yet, for all its dynamism, the sector is also becoming more crowded and ambitious young entrepreneurs are looking upwards and outwards for further growth opportunities.  Viable paths to expansion include moving to fixed premises, manufacturing value added products for retail and franchising mobile units. By growing this way, street food entrepreneurs are able to create more resilient businesses with higher employment and turnover.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, today\u2019s street food entrepreneurs tend to be young, first time business owners and although they have developed useful skills they are often self-taught and lack formal enterprise education. Hence there is a clear argument for providing timely, tailored business training enabling them to overcome the strategic and operational challenges of scaling up. \r\n\r\nThen again, unless food entrepreneurs work in a region conducive to innovation and strategic food marketing, their efforts will be truncated.  Collective action is required: local authorities and economic development stakeholders must also grasp the potential of the street food movement to evolve into a vibrant regional food scene based on high quality, local produce, accessibility and authenticity. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Street Food: Opportunities for Regions aims to deliver high training for street food entrepreneurs to grow their businesses, at the same time as it works with HEIs and business development organizations that provide VET for the food sector, and wider economic development stakeholders to harness food SMEs as a driver of regional growth.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we will: \r\na) Engage 50- 60 high level stakeholder organizations in 5 Regional Alliances. Together they will \r\nstudy the evolution of the street food phenomenon, devise and implement 5 Regional Action Plans to boost the growth of innovative food entrepreneurs and their contribution to economic development and tourism at regional level. \r\nb) Publish a \u201cStreet Food: Opportunities for Regions\u201d Toolkit to facilitate the replication of Regional Alliances of this nature across Europe.\r\nc) Create Street Food Success: What\u2019s Next? a course curriculum and learning materials to help street food entrepreneurs grow their businesses successfully\r\nd) Trial the course with at least 50 street food entrepreneurs in participating countries, and 25 VET trainers, then publish the course, and engage in dissemination activities and events to facilitate its inclusion in mainstream VET provision.\r\n\r\nStreet Food: Opportunities for Regions has been carefully structured to generate impact for current street food entrepreneurs and the VET providers who serve them, as well as creating wider benefits for the HEI-VET community and overall regional economic development. \r\n\r\nAt individual level, street food entrepreneurs who take the course are more likely to grow their businesses, moving into new markets and products with greater confidence and skills for success.  Micro and small enterprises form the cornerstone of local communities and economies and so their success will contribute to a strong local food sector that is an integral part of a healthy and affordable economy.\r\n\r\nAt organizational level, VET providers, especially enterprise centres and business development centres, will benefit from an immediate addition to their portfolio of training services, offering better support for a new and growing group of young entrepreneurs which are currently not catered for. \r\n\r\nThrough the establishment of Regional Alliances, a wide spectrum of other stakeholders will be impacted positively, gaining greater awareness of the potential of street food to evolve into a mature and vibrant food sector and the specific policy tools and operational strategies that will enable them to achieve this. Based on this process and the commitments that each organization makes as part of the Regional Action Plan, high level stakeholders in enterprise training, economic development, tourism marketing will be better able to fulfil their organizational mission and to do so in a cost effective way (by pooling resources) which leads to a real increase in regional food identity, tourism and economic development.\r\n\r\nThe permanency of the Alliance will be cemented through the sense of achievement and strong social capital generated in the project and will become a reliable means of ensuring ongoing, systemic improvements to increasing the relevancy of VET for young food sector entrepreneurs and harnessing their growth as part of overall economic development strategies region by region.", "http://www.bdelonline.com", "Trade Management Services Ltd", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013678_2"], [2018, "Ambition to Employ", "Banbridge District Enterprises Ltd", 211846.0, 5, 6, "Small businesses are one of the main components of economic growth, social development and quality of life for EU citizens. However, the first steps of growth, especially the transition from being a sole trader to hiring a first employee(s), are not always easy. Lack of knowledge about the regulatory environment is a factor, but studies show that barriers are often perceived, and so hiring a first employee essentially requires sole traders to \u201ccross a psychological threshold for which they are ill prepared.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis lack of preparation has become more evident as reasons for moving into self-employment in the current economic climate have as much to do with the \u201cpush\u201d away from other forms of employment, as with the desire to start and grow a new business. The skills gap is further aggravated by the fact that the majority of public sector investment in business training has been directed to high potential growth start ups, while there has been little improvement in the quality of mainstream training for \u201cstandard\u201d businesses, including sole traders.\r\n\r\nAmbition to Employ will develop a new training model to enable self-employed owner-operators to hire their first employee with knowledge, ability and confidence. This requires teaching the practical, legal and financial aspects of employment and sustainable business growth, but also applying new insights into overcoming the psychological barriers and risks involved.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet these needs, our specific objectives are:\r\na) Create a self assessment tool enabling an objective assessment of readiness to employ and generating a personalized learning pathway. (IO1)\r\nb) Develop a new training model with comprehensive support for business trainers and advisors on how to impart the knowledge, skills and self-belief required to hire a first employee.(IO2)\r\nc) Create and market an open, free online course so that busy self employed individuals can access this new training directly. (IO3)\r\nd) Train the first  group of business trainers from key VET providers in each region contributing both to quality development, dissemination, and above all, the exploitation and sustainability of the project\u2019s outputs.\r\n\r\nAmbition to Employ will involve participants in pilot testing and a train-the-trainer learning activity, as well as in multiplier events. As a result, the results will be: \r\n- 20 VET providers will integrate this new topic of teaching to their entrepreneurship training and business support services with 40 more planning to use the model /OERs in following 2 years. \r\n- 220 self-employed entrepreneurs during the lifespan of the project, and 800 more in the following 2 years, will acquire the skills to take on their first employee, boosting their ability to achieve sustainable business growth and contributing to job creation overall.\r\n- Stakeholders in VET and wider business development will increase support for the integration of activities which improve the quality and contribution of self employment above and beyond a regulatory or financial incentive approach. They will recognise the value of combining knowledge creation with new pedagogical approaches to developing entrepreneurial mindsets and softer skills, including risk management and leadership.\r\n\r\nAgainst a backdrop of ongoing political and economic insecurity and weak growth, which has caused a notable rise in the number of self-employed entrepreneurs across Europe, Ambition to Employ stands to make a significant contribution to updating our VET systems and  increasing our capacity to teach much-needed entrepreneurial competences. The project will also generate strong return-on-investment in terms of its direct relationship with job creation.  \r\n\r\nThe overall impact will be a strengthening of our VET systems to respond to the changing patterns of employment and entrepreneurship. To date, many policy makers have either turned a blind eye to the fact that the recent rise in self-employment does not correlate to a rise in growth-oriented businesses; or if they are aware of the structural problems pushing people into self-employment, they have favoured fiscal incentives to encourage growth through employment.  This ignores many of the real reasons why self-employed solo entrepreneurs are not growing their businesses.\r\n\r\nAmbition to Employ establishes a new approach to ensuring the latent potential for solo entrepreneurs to contribute to job creation and wider economic growth are capitalized upon: by creating a new training model and the capacity to roll it out to dozens of training providers across our countries, we provide very practical assistance to this growing target group and show that responsive education strategies can make a difference.", "http://www.bdelonline.com", "Banbridge District Enterprises Ltd", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-048089_coordinator"], [2015, "Food Incubators Transforming Regions", "Banbridge District Enterprises Ltd", 207780.0, 4, 7, "Food and drink represents the largest manufacturing sector in the EU and encouragingly has sustained positive growth. Even during the economic downturn, levels of employment in the food and drink industry remained quite stable.  The majority of the  287,000 EU food companies employing employ 4.25 million people are SMEs or micro-enterprises. While the sector has excellent potential for artisan and specialty producers to establish, the lack of access to food grade workspace is a serious and inhibiting barrier to entry (40% of emerging food producers found the lack of  production space an inhibiting factor to business growth and of concern in terms of business effectiveness).  Artisan food producers struggle to support the capital requirements of setting up a production facility (investing in a food production unit is second only to  the establishment costs of a pharma clean room!).   On the other hand, there is an abundance of underutilized properties in public and private ownership which could be re-imagined as vibrant Food Incubators but the promoters of same lack the skills and practical strategies to develop them. Food incubators have the unique potential to spur productive, inclusive & sustainable economic development. They provide a strong foundation for the creation and expansion of food businesses and jobs by helping communities, VET bodies, development agencies to revitalise underutilised buildings into powerhouses of food sector learning, innovation and production.    At a time of rising social inequality, Food Incubators also offer the prospect of expanding employment  in the growing food sector through educational opportunities for disadvantaged populations.\r\n\r\nFood Incubators Transforming Regions (FITR) seeks to forge an effective & replicable model to provide the learning and strategic structure to develop food kitchens &incubators as enterprise,  training and support drivers at regional level.  The partnership involves 7 partners across 4 counties - UK, Ireland, Netherlands and Slovakia and will run for 24 months.  Its rationale is clear .. while there are many VET responses for food entrepreneurs and SMEs, there is no VET in the theme of training tools for developing regional infrastructure and support structures that will stimulate food economies.    FITR will comprise unique training curriculum and course materials to successfully establish and manage food incubator hubs to cater for the growing numbers of emerging food entrepreneurs who are in urgent need of a place to produce, learn and grow.   It will target community drivers, development agencies and VET bodies.  Developed by a compelling mix of  academics & industry specialists, it epitomizes quality VET provision.\r\n\r\nOur efforts are focused on three clear target groups:\r\na) Community leaders,  Chambers of Commerce , SMEs and agri food groups who need VET resources & tools and strategic support from FITR Regional Partnerships to help them develop food incubators \r\nb) HEIs and business development organizations that provide VET for the food sector.\r\nc) Local authorities and public sector agencies that can support food incubators (financially and logistically in terms of providing land, buildings and other resources) to drive regional economic and growth. \r\n\r\nThe project will work to fulfill the following objectives: \r\n a) Establish 4 sustainable, sector focused 4 Regional Partnerships to study and capture best practice in the development of Food incubators and through a Triple Helix  leadership network (involving industry, universities, and regional development bodies) develop 4 Action Plans as the ultimate blueprint to develop physical food incubator hubs at regional level\r\nb) Create and publish a \u201cThe Essential Toolkit to developing a Regional Food Incubator\u201d to facilitate the replication of both the Regional Partnership and the Food Incubator  across Europe.   This will focus on \"how-to\u201d strategies for food hub establishment and\r\noperation that are based on successful models operating in other regions and new concepts from the US (the market leaders in food incubators)\r\nc) Create and publish a course curriculum, guiding VET practitioners on the topics and skills most needed to establish and manage a Food incubator.\r\nd) Develop an intensive blended learning \u201cThe Essential Toolkit to develop a successful Food Incubator\u201d course based on open education resources, targeting regional changemakers in local government, development agencies, communities, businesses, not-for profits and others interested in establishing food hubs \r\n\r\nThere is a clear argument for providing timely, tailored training to a food sector Triple Helix  leadership network (involving industry, universities, and regional development bodies), building on their experience and enabling them to overcome the strategic and operational challenges of  food facilities deficits.

A leading driver of dynamic and innovative economies and an area of focus for EU development, it represents 6.8 % of European GDP (approximately \u20ac860 billion) and 6.5% of European employment (approximately 14 million).   Yet for all this potential, there is little opportunity for disadvantage groups to connect with VET in the creative economy as a stepping stone to entrepreneurship. Youth unemployment is a challenge across our partnership - in November 2014 it was 23.2% in Poland, 23% in Sweden, 21.8% in Ireland and a lower 16% in the UK.  It is clear that early school leavers and those of low educational attainment do not have the qualifications or resources to access universities and HEls in this field.  Karen Price OBE explains it clearly-  \u2018There is enormous raw capability in young people \u2026 if we could polish it up. If we could introduce that into our education system \u2026 we would transform the economy.\u201d   But the gap between real world opportunities and teaching is very acute in the creative industries where generic training strategies for creative entrepreneurship do not include community based VET responses.\r\n\r\nCreative Communities Igniting Change has been carefully structured to generate impact for the young unemployed and other socially excluded target groups, the communities that have experienced brain drain and high levels of unemployment and eyesore empty buildings and the VET providers who serve them, by achieving an effective and replicable core model for creative industries training and support within a community environment that provides access to VET for key target groups but also leads to broader economic innovation and revitalisation.\r\n\r\nOver 24 months, CCiC will achieve this in 4 regions in Ireland, UK, Poland and Sweden over 4 key deliverables:-\r\n1)  By establish 4 sustainable, sector specific Regional Alliances  (in Ireland, UK/Northern Ireland, Poland and Sweden) we are forging collaborative relationships between VET providers and HEIs, creative industry bodies, economic actors, local governments and wider stakeholders that will optimise and mobilise the creative sector strategic response at regional level. \r\n2) The resultant 4 Action Plans will improve the quality and relevance of creative industries training and support on offer and provide entrepreneurship pathways.   The creation of a \u201cCreative Communities Igniting Change Toolkit\u201d will facilitate the replication of Regional Alliances of this nature across Europe.  Such is our belief in the innovativeness of this strategic response, that we will commit to ensuring that our Toolkit will be adopted by at least 2 other regions (outside of our partnership) within the lifetime of the project.\r\n3) Create and publish a course curriculum, guiding VET practitioners on the topics and skills most needed by emerging creative entrepreneurs from at risk target groups.   Our blended learning \u201cCreative Business as a Source of Employment\u201d course, will  help potential creative entrepreneurs to set up business in 90 days.  We will also provide training to develop or enhance physical creative hubs in local communities.  \r\n4) Policy agenda at the heart of the project \u2013 CCIC will embed policy for development of creative regions by creating lasting partnership structures that will have a positive and long-lasting effect on the creative industries policy systems in each region. \r\n\r\nThe CCiC project will engage with four clear target groups\r\na)  Unemployed youth, women, older people, people with disabilities,  minority groups\r\nb)  Communities with physical space that can be easily converted to a creative hub - often overlooked, we will embed this project in local communities.
