Our community faces the challenges of meeting the growing demand for plastic pipes and the EU Landfill Directive and the revised EU Waste Framework Directive. The polluter-pays principle says that the costs of waste management are to be borne partly or wholly by the producer of the product from which the waste came and the distributors of such products, who are our SME members. Under floor heating, radiator heating and plumbing systems accounting in total 1.7 million kilometres of new piping in Europe, of which 56%, namely 0.96 million km are plastic pipes. 46% of these plastic pipes are made of PEX, which due to its cross-linked nature is not recyclable. Recycling of multilayer pipes with encapsulated aluminium results in highly toxic by-products. About 3500 tonnes of scrap plastic pipes is disposed of in land fill due to the use of non-recyclable plastics.\n\nOur idea is the development of a universal flexible plastic pipe system suitable for under floor heating, radiator heating and drinking water distribution. We propose to develop a pipe without PEX, and without an integral aluminium layer to allow 100% of the pipe scrap to be recycled. We will achieve this by replacing aluminium or expensive EVOH oxygen barrier materials with innovative nanocomposites in combination with a redefined wrapping technology.\n\nThe plumbing and heating contractors will benefit from selling a new innovative fully environment-compatible universal pipe system providing: savings in costs for storage, transportation, and logistics; improved work facilities (easy to install and bend); waste cost savings and CO2 emission savings.

This project will deliver that Investor Confidence Project (ICP) to the EU.\nSeveral studies document the potential energy savings for efficiency investments as well as the scale of the investment needed. BPIE estimated EUR937bn investment would be necessary in their Deep Scenario to achieve 78% energy savings and 90% CO2 savings.  \nDespite evidence of the potential attractiveness of investments, the flow of finance into energy efficiency remains much lower than required. Analysis reveals several barriers that hold private capital back but especially a lack of standardised processes and documentation, analogous to those used in the oil & gas and renewables industries. All financial markets are enabled by buyers and sellers agreeing standards. Scaling up investment in efficiency will require standardisation and greatly increased capacity in the financing market \u2013 ICP Europe addresses these issues. \nThe project will work with key stakeholders to develop open source Protocols and apply them to real projects. The project has measurable KPIs but the real aim is to get commitment from investors that they will specify the use of the Protocols by project developers seeking finance \u2013 making them standards. \nThe advantages of standardization, the adoption of the ICP in the US, and the high level of interest from EU investors that this pan-European multi-disciplinary consortium has already demonstrated lead us to believe that this is realisable objective within the 36 month project.
