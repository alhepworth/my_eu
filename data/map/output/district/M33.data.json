Self-assembly is one route to nanopatterns but regularity/alignment over large areas is not consistent with circuit manufacture. Recent work on the self-assembly of block-copolymer (BCP) systems suggests that realisation of patterns of small feature size (~10 nm), at high density (i.e. spaced at ~10 nm), in precisely defined positions (to an accuracy of &lt; 10 nm) on a large area substrate (12\u201d) is possible. This proposal will develop BCP methodology into a set of process techniques for subsequent industrial pre-development.

We are embarking on this project with twin aims of improving our own linguistic competencies, teaching and learning, and to obtain a resource bank of authentic Spanish resources in order to create a more stimulating Spanish learning environment. Our Senior Leadership Team and subject lead believe that applying for funding and completing the mobilities will be the most effective way of achieving these goals, and raising the profile of Foundation Subjects such as MFL also forms part of our current School Development Plan. \r\n\r\nWe have five key staff currently involved in this application. These include our Spanish teacher and Languages Coordinator, one UKS2 class teacher, one LKS2 teacher/teacher governor, one KS1 teacher/NQT, and one TA/playground assistant. Our subject lead has lived aboard and has experience of teaching English as a foreign language as well as teaching foreign languages in England, and experience of learning languages such as Spanish, Italian, and Russian. One teacher has an A level in French, and a partially completed NVQ in Spanish, another specialised in MFL during her PGCE, and another has taught Spanish on her PGCE placements and is keen to take this further.\r\n\r\nWe are applying specifically for funding to enable the delegates to use their mobilities via the course provider ClaroGB. We understand their course and the aims and coverage marry perfectly with what we want to achieve for MFL as a school. These mobilities will involve intensive language training focused particularly on the needs of the teachers involved, teaching methodology and pedagogical practice, sharing ideas with UK and international colleagues, making a strong, face to face link with a Spanish school, participation in cultural activities, and forming a professional network of local and international teachers. \r\n\r\nWe anticipate that this project could take place over two years. Phase 1 involves application for the mobilities, assessment of the delegates\u2019 current linguistic competences, and auditing of the Spanish resources currently held in school. This phase will also involve linguistic preparation on behalf of the delegates, compiling a list of authentic resources to collect whilst on the trip, and initiating and establishing a link with the Spanish school. Phase 2 will comprise of the mobilities themselves, which we will aim to take as a school group of five, in order to enable the maximum impact on our return to the UK.

We will do this by sending ten teaching staff from across the school from EYFS to UKS2 on an immersion course in Spain, and use the impact from the project to support the development of a sustainable model of teaching and learning languages throughout the school.As a growing school, we need to be able to develop a sustainable model of teaching languages within our growing school. We are seeking to minimise the disruption to the regular timetable i.e. specialist language teachers coming out of their own class to teach other classes across the school. We aim to have at least two teaching staff per year group who have the skills, knowledge and enthusiasm to deliver a high quality Spanish curriculum. We will focus primarily on delivering languages at KS2, given the statutory requirements that are now in place. However, as a school we feel that learners benefit from earlier exposure to language learning, and are aiming to deliver some level of language learning across the whole school.Thus teaching and learning will be improved through participation in this project, and standards of language delivery will be enhanced through new experiences and learnings. Lessons will be planned, taught and assessed to a consistently high standard and Spanish language will be embedded into every day routines, and not just spoken in designated lesson time. There will be a positive impact on other national curriculum subjects, particularly grammar and early years maths.Use of new technologies will be integral to the teaching and learning of Spanish, as well as the communication between link schools in Spain.There will be an enhanced awareness of the significance of languages spoken in our school, and local community. We will celebrate the multicultural diversity that is characteristic of our school, and use the project to raise awareness of the importance of Spanish as a key international language. Following participation in the project, teaching staff will become more confident in the delivery of a high quality languages teaching and learning curriculum. The project will have a positive impact on their CPD and enhance their future career prospects.We are keen to involve the learners themselves as much as possible and will ask them, at regular intervals, to share their feedback about language learning and the impact the project is having on their learning experiences. We will also seek regular feedback from all key stakeholders within school to ensure we maximize the impact of the project\u2019s success. Additionally, we will use the project to develop key links and partnerships:\u2022 Identify and maintain communication with link schools in Spain, through relationships with teaching counterparts, and also as a platform for sharing information for pupils.\u2022 develop key relationships with cluster primary schools to share experiences, resources and learnings. \u2022 develop links with local feeder secondary schools to support transition to KS3. \u2022 involve parents and the local community as part of our \u2018languages days\u2019.Throughout the project we will monitor and measure success and report these at regular intervals to SLT, the Board of Governors and the wider school team. We hope that this project will have a great impact on our pupils\u2019 future aspirations and the choices they make in terms of their future education and careers.", "http://www.springfieldprimarysale.co.uk", "Springfield Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-024004_coordinator"], [2014, "Window to our World - Language and Cultural Exchange", "Springfield Primary School", 14314.0, 1, 1, "Window to our World - Language and Cultural Exchange\r\n\r\nContext/Background\r\nAs a growing Primary School, we would like to seek this opportunity to develop our school's international dimension. We currently have only one specialist teacher who teaches Spanish across the school, but as we develop to become a three-form entry school we would like to enhance our language and intercultural offering by encouraging a wider pool of teaching staff to include some Spanish teaching and learning across the curriculum. Furthermore, we would also like to develop key opportunities for learners to develop real partnerships with link schools in Spain. Through these links, learners will develop a insight to Spanish culture and language thus increasing immediate and latent motivation to maintain these interests.\r\n\r\nKey Objectives\r\n- To improve linguistic development of teachers' Spanish language skills and intercultural awareness\r\n- To provide opportunities for learners to develop real links with a partner school in Spain, thus establishing regular contact with Spanish learners\r\n- To make use of available ICT applications and provide learners with key opportunities to develop their ICT skills\r\n- To develop a greater language presence and awareness across the School\r\n- To enhance the School's international dimension\r\n\r\nProfile of Participants\r\nWe will send up to 10 participants from across a range of departments. It is likely that the MFL Coordinator, who has a background in Spanish learning, will attend at least one of these visits. Participants will be chosen using a select committee and will be selected based on a range of criteria, level of school responsibility and availability. Prior knowledge of the Spanish language is not compulsory, but interest in language learning and commitment to enhancing Springfield's International dimension is important.\r\n\r\nActivities\r\nAs well as sending up to 10 teaching professionals on an immersion course in Spain, we will also undertake a series of activities at our school in the UK, and in conjunction with one of more partner schools in Spain. These activities will include enhanced teaching of Spanish language and culture; Spanish club to provide opportunities to communicate with partner schools; training sessions with wider teaching team; regular exchange between MFL Coordinator/teaching staff in UK and Spain.\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nThe course provider will assess participants' language levels before and after the mobility using Europass. There will be regular contact between the course providers and the school to arrange the practicalities of the visit(s), including full risk assessment. Participants will also develop a learning agreement, which will underpin their involvement in the project, and enable them to set their own targets, based on individual needs. As a team, we will hold regular reviews of progress against these objectives, and collectively discuss possible improvements and modifications. At the end of the project, results will be disseminated to key stakeholders through a wide variety of activities. \r\n\r\nResults and Impact\r\nSuccessful implementation and fulfilment of the project will have a positive impact on participants, learners, the School and link school. All partners will benefit from improved linguistic competencies, enhanced teaching and learning opportunities and the opportunity to widen international links and dimensions. The use of variety of ICT applications will further develop ICT skills. Participants will be given the opportunity to enhance their teaching skills towards developing their CPD portfolio. In the longer term, learners will have gained a real and relevant experience of language learning, which could have a positive impact on their longer term secondary options, as well as even longer terms employment opportunities.", "http://www.springfieldprimarysale.co.uk", "Springfield Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002120_coordinator"]]}}}}
