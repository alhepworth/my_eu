The European Union is committed to transforming its transport and energy systems as part of a future low carbon economy. It is recognized that FCH technologies have an important role in this transformation and they are part of the Strategic Energy Technologies Plan (SET) Plan adopted by the European Council. This is in line with the European Commission\u2019s (EC) Communication \u201cEnergy for a Changing World \u2013 An Energy Policy for Europe\u201d, the goals of the Lisbon Strategy and the European Strategic Transport Technology Plan.Hydrogen vehicle technology is commercializing rapidly, while the increasing demand for skilled labor in this field contrasts with the lack of training programmes provided to technicians. Denmark is, as far as known, the only country in the world that has nationwide network of hydrogen filling stations (10 stations).  Denmark is one of the first countries to get access to the new fuel cell vehicles from Toyota and Hyundai. Thus, Denmark is leading in implementing  fuel cell vehicles - and also a leader in system knowledge.The increasing number of hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles will lead to growth in employment in service and maintenance of these vehicles and thus an increasing demand for skilled labor in the field.Education and training in the fuel cells and hydrogen sector is critical for the current and future workforce and thereby supports indirectly the commercialization of the technology. Knowledgeable and capable workforce that understands the functioning of both technology and underlying fundamental processes, but knows also about obstacles and technological restrictions, is essential for successful development, planning and implementation of FCH technology.It is widely accepted that job opportunities for technicians and workers within the fuel cells and hydrogen (FC & H2) applications will emerge in the short term, but there is also a lack of appropriate training for technicians.Hydrogen vehicle technology is commercializing rapidly, while the increasing demand for skilled labor in this field contrasts with the lack of training programmes provided to technicians. This highlights the need for transferable skills and a common training approach for this new sector. It has become fundamental to share European knowledge and experiences to participate in the creation of an appropriate training in order to develop excellence covering hydrogen vehicle maintenance.It is the project purpose to gather experiences and knowledge from three European countries (each of them owning an area of excellence in the FCH technology) and convert it in a training programme for future technicians of FCH vehicles. The project's expected results are: O1: Report: Mapping the necessary content of the curricula and compendium, explore the posibilities for integration of the training programme in the already existing study programmesO2: Training curriculumO3: CompendiumO4: Description of training sessionsO5: Preparation for accreditationThere will be two training sessions during the project period: a training sessions for trainers and a training sessions for FC technicians. The main target groups of the project are:- Auto mechanics (car and trucks);- Organizations providing professional training courses (including VET organizations);- Municipalities interested in introducing i.e. FCH buses;- FCH vehicle manufacturers;- Car dealers.- Auto workshops.", "http://www.nescol.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA202-022336_5"], [2014, "Getting Ready for European Citizenship on-line", "North East Scotland College", 190329.0, 7, 7, "The aim of this project is to build solutions for the integration of adult citizens of the EU in 21st century. Euroscepticism , European citizenship, using digital tools, identity, cultural diversity, integration, economy, history, multicultural, plural, open-minded are the key concepts that will be addressed during the three years.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this aim we will work through cooperation and partnership among countries using digital tools. \r\n\r\nWe will design and develop an online course called \u201cGetting Ready for European Citizenship on-line\u201d (GRECOL) which is inspired by a previous Grundtvig partnership project called \u201cDigital Classroom\u201d. During the project we observed, in adult learners across  this Grundtvig partnership a notable lack of European identity and a lack of awareness of the wide range of European resources available to facilitate their mobility and develop their sense of shared citizenship. \r\n\r\nOnce this new partnership was created with the participation of 7 adult organizations from ES, GE, LV, IT, TR, UK, DK countries with diverse backgrounds but with common motivations for changing adult education in EU, we started to develop the project.\r\n\r\nEuropean citizenship implies a closer, more emotional relationship that is rooted in shared values, the celebration of diversity, and respect of different identities and the protection of national heritages.\r\n\r\nThe proposed new course, comprised of 5 modules detailed below, may be offered in online and blended-learning formats. In addition, the 5 modules may be independently utilized as stand-alone materials or integrated into other courses according to the individual needs of each educational context.  \r\n\r\nThe structure of the subject \u201cGetting Ready for European citizenship\u201d (GRECOL) will be:\r\n\r\n1. M1.Developing a European identity\r\n\r\n2. M2. European institutions and their functions \r\n\r\n3. M3.European mobility \r\n\r\n4. M4. Dealing with cultural diversity \r\n\r\n5. M5. Final Project \r\n\r\nThe methodology of the course is based on a model that develops its activities through the web and on the web. The students become the center of the model and the process of learning. The model is aware of the nature of the potential students. The general features of e-activities are diversity, openness and flexibility and they contain discussions, tasks, quizzes, surveys, and a final project using a varied range of digital tools.\r\n\r\nThe final product will be an OER material ready for be using for any adult institution around Europe. During the third year of the project impact and dissemination will be the main goal by sharing GRECOL as much as possible al local, national and international level in platforms, congress, papers.  And of course, using GRECOL as a course, curricula, module or workshop in each one of the partnership' organizations during the following years.   \r\n\r\nAt the end of the project we hope to offer some solutions for the integration of adult citizens in Europe to become e-citizens. Getting involved in joint projects as well as increased mobility helps to develop this feeling of belonging.
