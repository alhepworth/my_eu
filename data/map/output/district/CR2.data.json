The partnership emerged from a common problem of the three participating countries: high level of unemployment among low-skilled migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, especially marginalized women. These groups are either not eligible for governmental funded education opportunities or are difficult to reach and/or unwilling to commit to further education. \r\nTo became employable, these people need support not only in obtaining a recognized qualification and work experience in UK/ Italy/ Romania, but often they firstly need help in developing good literacy, numeracy, digital and media skills. \r\nUK has a high number of migrants from the EU and non-EU countries. Italy, and especially Sicily, is confronted with a huge number of African migrants who are often lacking opportunities for development and integration. Surprisingly even Romania is confronted with a double problem: not only the Romanian low skilled emigrants to Western Europe, who are often marginalized and discriminated, but also the immigrants from Russia, Ukraine or third world countries who are trying to make a living in Romania. This country is very unprepared for integrating the immigrants, and the support available for learning Romanian language or accessing qualifications is very low.  \r\nThe project objectives are:\r\n1. To understand the barriers to attainment in adult education for low-skilled migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, especially marginalized women in the three cities.\r\n2. To develop and implement a new learning and teaching methodologies and pedagogical approaches for language teaching by combining classroom based teaching with out-of-classroom , virtual learning and open educational resources, promoting language skills, social mixing and European values. \r\n3. To grow the number of learners from the targeted groups that enroll in the project\u2019s adult education opportunities by increasing the civil dialogue and cooperation with relevant stakeholders (social partners, NGOs, governmental institutions, business partners) \r\n4. To develop and promote an online European e-learning centre for teaching functional skills, digital skills and childcare, as well as European integration, cultural awareness, active citizenship, employment skills and media literacy available for both local people & those going to emigrate within the EU.\r\n5. To develop an on-line Learning Mentoring platform and a face-to-face Learning Mentoring programme where mentors and mentees will be able to work together, supporting the learning process and integration \r\n6. To develop new methods and tools for in-service training for the teaching, administrative and managerial staff of the three partner organisations in order to improve their digital skills and skills for working with learners from the targeted backgrounds, by exchanging good practice between the partners, promoting peer-to-peer learning and better use of European resources for adult education.", "http://Www.elmhousetraining.com", "Elmhouse Childcare Ltd", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA204-036864_coordinator"]]}}, "0HE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "les artisans de la r\u00e9gion Nouvelle-Aquitaine \u00e0 la conqu\u00eate de l'Europe", "Apprendre l'anglais", 829161.0, 14, 21, "It is a major issue for the future that apprentices acquire the relevant training and experience to run the small craft businesses of tomorrow in their chosen trade, ensuring that synergy is supported European and National level.

ROC A12 aims at an annual, quantitative growth of ten percent in our student mobility. This matches the tendency of a growing number of internship applications by students. This application is based on the participation of some 80 students doing an internship abroad. We strive for an equal division of internships for both students across all training courses we offer. Students do their internships abroad at a company or organisation related to their line of business or professional field. They develop new professional competences, gain intercultural knowledge and improve their language skills. Students carry out tasks and activities matching their status as starting professional practitioners.   The impact aimed at in this international mobility project boils down to creating flexible, multi-skilled and interculturally competent employees who are able to comunicate in foreign languages; well equipped to operate successfully in a globalising labour market and society. ROC A12 intends to contribute to a quality foundation of skilful employees in the (Eu)region now and in the future.  We also aim at making internationalisation easily accessible to all students and we strive towards a high level of internationalisation at our school. Dissemination of results takes place internally for all students and co-workers of ROC A12, externally for the international partners, by means of local and regional press and TV, for regional and national schools we work with, at national professional meetings and networking events.

Research will be conducted in both the training course and professional stay. The result of this research will be implemented at our institution, through a process of continuous feedback throughout the project duration.\r\nThe main impact of the project is that students in our school can learn English effectively in environments which are innovative, put in practice attractive methodologies and thus have a tool to enhance their European identity.\r\nIn the long term is to improve the quality of education in our center through teacher training, a change in language teaching methodology and network of contacts with European centers for future collaborations.", "http://www.croydonhigh.gdst.net", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA104-015019_2"]]}}}}
