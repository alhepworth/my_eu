Together with correspondents and companies in 9 countries, we organize language preparations, vocational training, ensure social support and recognize and validate documentation. Mobility projects are conducted as an integrated part of the vocational education. ISK has close cooperation with partners in Europe, in preparation, implementation and the concluding part of projects. We have preparatory meetings, regular contact via Facebook groups, systematic feedback from our correspondents, mail/phone communication and read mandatory blogs. In addition all the interns are visited by us during their stay to ensure the quality of the projects.Vocational education and mobilityISK\u2019s work is in line with regional, national and European goals for education, thoroughly described in the application for 2015-2017. The work is seen in direct context with the following areas of focus in the Regional Plan of Action for 2016. Strengthen the quality work in Upper Secondary EducationStrengthen Vocational Educational trainingGive youth the opportunity to acquire tomorrow\u2019s competencesStrengthen the pupil\u2019s competence in a foreign languageWe believe in the importance of giving VET students opportunity to gain international experience as a mean for growing status of Vocational Educational Training, preventing dropouts and increasing the formal and informal competence to future craftsmen. An academic education will often grant a certain extent of mobility to complete an education. Craftsmen can, to a larger degree, complete their education and get a job at/close to their home. Considering the increasing xenophobia in Europe, we think it is of significance to give our target group an opportunity to go abroad, expand their horizons, gain a cultural competence, become confident and aware of own identity and thus become open to new impulses. So, mobility projects become an important asset to combat xenophobia.Development in scope. Education is developing and different programs will in the future lead to craft certificates. In the years to come, new models will be offered to meet the needs of the business sector and adapt to a higher completion of higher secondary education. Our target group will thus not homogenously be interns in companies. Students can also receive craft certificates by attending 4 years of Technical and Academic Education (TAF), a dual educational system or a final year in Upper Secondary School. ISK will offer all target groups the same opportunities to gain international experience and competence. These groups will need different kinds of projects regarding language and duration compared to regular interns in companies. We have successfully tested 5-week mobility for TAF-students and wish to continue developing this. Also, we will offer opportunities for students in the above- mentioned groups and continue developing projects for trainees with special needs. Subsequently, we will have to offer shorter stays, stays with accompanying persons, stays at technical schools, flexible departures and stays without language barriers.Our objective is an increase of the amount of mobilities from 5% to 6%, to reach the European Parliament\u2019s goals of mobility within VET. This will equal an increase from 60 to 80 mobilities from Hedmark and Oppland. Our challenge is that the Norwegian Educational loan Fund since 2015 has ended their grant scheme related to our target groups. To reach our goal, this means that we are applying for, and hope to succeed in receiving, higher Erasmus+ funding to compensate, or alternatively cut down the number of mobilities to approximately the half.New partnersIn order to reach our goals of offering projects to different target groups, we are in a constant process regarding partners. We will likely be in continually search for and enter agreements with new correspondents, but not necessarily use everyone in all projects. DocumentationLearning Agreements will be used and developed to ensure quality and we intend to follow advice of the Norwegian National ECVET Expert Group. We consider Learning Agreement as a useful tool in the correspondence between instructor and intern. All interns receive a Europass Mobility document as a certificate of their learning abroad. MentorsTo integrate the project in the education, it is needed that the mentors are offered to visits to their interns. Mentors will  thus be able to rise the interns\u2019 competence by using this experiences in academic discussions in own companies.

The primary activity is a 14 week stay. We organize preparations, professional and social follow-ups along with documentation of practice. We hold meetings to prepare the apprentice, stay in contact with them and our affiliates at their arrival, stay, departure and after the project has ended. We monitor their stay by staying in touch on Facebook, sms, mail and via phone. The apprentices write a blog we follow up and is published on our website, www.reisut.no. We visit all our apprentices during their stay. This gives us the opportunity to ensure the quality of their stay.  Our associates are key to ensuring the quality. We occasionally stay in touch via mail and phone and are available 24/7 if the need arises and know what we can expect and demand of each other. An open dialogue ensures that any eventual challenges are uncovered, that we\u2019re both informed and can solve them as quickly as possible. \r\nOur partners are the apprentices contact person(s) and safety net during their stay. They stay in touch with the apprentices before their departure, meet them at their arrival, follow them to their living quarters, introduce them to the company, are responsible for cultural and linguistic preparation, have regular follow-ups and are available during their entire stay. They\u2019re familiar with the routines for reviewing and obtaining the signed Learning Agreement and Europass Mobility document from the companies before and after the project is complete. ISO offers a stay abroad for ordinary apprentices, trainees, TAF apprentices and alternate VG3. ISO has started mobility for employees and will keep using our experiences to keep developing this work. The first projects are internships and preparational visits for teachers in vocational education.\r\nVOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND MOBILITY\r\nISOs work is in line with and a means to reach regional, national and european goals for education, as described in application for 2015-2017. The work falls in line with regional planning strategies for 2017-2020 for both Hedmark and Oppland, described in application for 2017-2019. ISOs work was fortified in Opplands county administrations International strategy 2017-2021 \u2022 Ensure that as many high school students as possible will get the opportunity to participate in international projects \u2022 Improve vocational education through several mobility projects for apprentices, students, teachers and company instructors \u2022 Increase competence in order to stimulate more Erasmus+ projects and other international exchanges. ISO contributes to more opportunities for youths to gain international experience. Internationalization improves the ability to be flexible, innovation and increased competence. Workers have the opportunity to complete their education and get a job close to their home. Considering the growing xenophobia in europe, we believe it essential that these youths have the opportunity to expand their horizons, increase their cultural competence, become aware of their own identities and more accepting of new impulses. Mobility can contribute to fight xenophobia and promote integration. \r\nDEVELOPEMENT\r\nWe see it as essential to develop an accordance between the documents used in the projects. ISO will keep developing Learning Agreement with content that\u2019s easily understandable in order for the companies to understand what work assignments they must provide and what level of competence they can expect. This will improve quality and predictability for both company and apprentice. In the past two years we\u2019ve sent apprentices within protected fields. This will continue to be a priority for us in 2018. We\u2019ve made connections to reputable companies within the woodcarver-, smith-, tailor-, glass blowing-, and watchmaker professions. These are professions with limited networks and resources for education in Norway. Therefore we see that our work with it will strengthen the schooling in these professions regionally and nationally by providing international networks and strengthen the professions position and development. In mobility for employees we will connect employees in companies. This will contribute to a more secure contact between the training managers in the vocational education and contribute to a more comprehensive training of future employees. In addition to that, we\u2019ll also contribute by aiding training managers necessary new competence that can be difficult to obtain in Norway. We see that digitalization and the green revolution are areas where this is especially applicable.\r\nDISSEMINATION\r\nISO will continue to utilize social media, our website, journals, local media, professional meeting places besides our own county administrations media advisors and heads of communication.

It is believed that with better sensing techniques, in excess of 500,000 tonnes of kerosene could be saved per annum, which equates to a CO2 saving of over 1.5 millions tonnes. Despite some successes in recent research, it has become clear that the capability gaps are not closing quickly enough. Further research in to sensors and instrumentation is, therefore, absolutely essential if the capability gaps are to be filled at an adequate rate.\n\nThe STARGATE project intends to target these critical gaps and create the biggest impact possible within the constraints of the Call budget. The project will develop a range of advanced new sensors for high temperature gas path, surface, and structural measurements. The project also contains some detailed studies on wireless sensing. The sensors will be validated using both laboratory and rig trials to define their performance against specific targets.

However an area which has been given much less attention up until now is how to achieve a time and cost effective lean assembly production system.  The current airframe assembly process of composites, metals and hybrid structures is affected by an important number of non-added value operations, which strongly cause disruptions and prevents fast ramp-up and high production rates.\nLOCOMACHS will focus on significantly reducing or totally eliminating the most time-consuming and hence expensive non-added value operations, e.g. temporary assembly to check gaps, shimming, dismantling and tool handling. The project will improve the design conditions which today strongly dictate the way part manufacture and assembly is performed. Important step changes will be made by dramatically improving the use of tolerance and geometrical variation management.\nThe project will integrate existing technologies with missing breakthrough technologies developed and matured within LOCOMACHS. To support the industrialisation of future assembly production lines, key innovations such as intelligent drilling, high speed non-contact hole inspection, compact automation and active flexible tooling will be demonstrated.\nThe design and assembly process improvements and breakthrough technologies will be validated on two physical partial wing box demonstrators, a virtual fuselage section demonstrator and additionally a virtual demonstrator showing a complete wing structure in the context of the next generation lean production flow.\nThis Level 2 proposal is being submitted in the 5th Call FP7-AAT-2012-RTD-1 against the activity area AAT.2012.4.4-1 \u201cIntegrated approach and demonstration to lean manufacturing of metal, composite and hybrid aircraft / engine structures\u201d by a Consortium led by Saab AB.", 155681.0, 25847600.0, 10, 33, "LOCOMACHS", null, "http://www.cobham.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112121.jpg", "fp7_105426_968044481"]]}}, "6SE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "GoEurope - wir bringen Berliner in Bewegung: Mobilit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Auszubildende, Berufssch\u00fcler, Absolventen der beruflichen Bildung, Referendare und  Berufsbildungsverantwortliche", "WESTBOURNE ACADEMY LIMITED", 1055550.0, 13, 30, "The city state of Berlin has a youth unemployment rate of roughly 9.5 % as of December 2015, the highest figure among all 16 German states.

The project will look at achieving this by analysing existing methods and procedures that are used by each of the project partners\u2019 youth music projects and programmes. These youth music projects and programmes will include lead partner Youth Work Ireland's Irish Youth Music Awards, Samf\u00e9s, National confederation of youth clubs in Iceland (Iceland) Stuck Together project , the Five nations partners UK Youth, Youth Action Northern Ireland, Youth CYMRU and Youth Scotland's Big Music Project and Lithuanian Children & Youth Center practice in youth work looking at education through non formal methods. Each partner will take on one area to specialise in based on their own knowledge. These will include:Employment - UK \u2013 (Four nations) - EmployabilityEnterprise - Iceland - Enterprise \u2013 business sideEducation \u2013 IrelandYouth Work Practice \u2013 Lithuania focussing on non \u2013 formal methods leading to competences oriented to their employability or making decisions on their professional studies.The project will produce an online toolkit/site for how to support young people\u2019s growth at the end of the project by focussing on desktop research, information sharing from existing information within each organisation and transnational meetings.This online toolkit/site will use an interactive content management system to create a space for rentention and disemention of material and policy after the project has completed. It will have active users who will be champion certain updates on the site similar to an online publication or blog as well as having an internal backend where users can link together on further projects and discuss current policy and initiatives. The site will work off an ACL which stands for Access Control List, it will allow the project partners to manage the users of the site, and different groups. This will create extensive control on who can see what and who can edit or manage what. This online toolkit/site will be able to embed and host existing information available and will act as a very crucial hub and online community for youth workers, volunteers and policy makers within Europe and further afield. This project will tie into the  \u201cEU  Youth  Strategy  (2010 - 2018) policy  cooperation  framework  of  the  EU\u201d  by adhering to its main objectivesTo provide more and equal opportunities for young people in education and in the labour marketTo encourage young people to be active citizens and participate in societyAs youth clubs and projects provide a safe space for young people to develop new skills we believe this is the perfect space to develop a programme which will support the growth of these young people into cultural entrepreneurs.In a report by EY commissioned by Gesac entitled \u201cCreating growth - Measuring cultural and creative markets in the EU\u201d published in December 2014 we can see the importance of supporting and developing young people's skills and expertise within the creative and music industries that exist. As stated in the report these industries contribute to revenues of \u20ac535.9b with the creative and cultural industries (CCIs) contribute to 4.2% of Europe\u2019s GDP. The sector is its third-largest employer, after construction and food and beverage service activities, such as bars and restaurants.The project will have a significant impact on a European level by creating a pan European youth focussed programme which will further contribute to empowerment of young people to express themselves as well as further upskilling them to explore third level education thus leading them to further contribute to the growth of the music and cultural industries that exist across Europe.

This is especially burdensome to young people who, due to lack of practical skills, are often the last group to be hired.  Addressing the problem of youth unemployment and lack of practical skills (experience), requires finding innovative and entrepreneurial solutions that involve youth leaders, facilitators, local, regional and national communities as well as input and participation from the youth themselves.   \r\n\r\nAddressing youth unemployment also means addressing the \"fall out\" from unemployment as well:  social and economic exclusion,  disenfranchisement and lack of participation in society and citizenship on all levels.   \r\n\r\nOur partner organisations plan to address these issues via a project with a two step implementation phase aimed first at organizing a seminar to expand and explore solutions to these problems and second, a youth exchange, where through a programme facilitated by the partner organisations and spearheaded by the targeted youth themselves, these methods will be addressed in innovative and entrepreneurial ways to create sustainable solutions that can be disseminated throughout local communities to impact an ever growing audience of people. \r\n\r\nEach project Activity (Seminar and the Youth Exchange) will bring together 24 participants from the UK and Lithuania.  The objectives of this project will be to bring together youth leaders and at risk youth in a tolerant and inclusive environment to work together to help resolve and remediate the issues related to unemployment, poverty and social exclusion  focusing on innovative solutions and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe seminar will bring together youth leaders and facilitators and will focus on training them to be educators, facilitators and stimulator's to create an energetic and innovative youth exchange. Dates of the Seminar: 24/07/2015 - 31/07/2015. \r\n\r\nOur youth leaders will meet the criteria of being peer leaders,  and having some experience in working with youth in an international level as well as involvement in community councils or forums.  \r\n\r\nThe young people  participating in the youth exchange will be chosen by the participating countries and criteria will be that they will be representative of the target population (young people facing employment difficulties).  The aim of the exchange is for the participants to  develop the skills  they need to increase their employability as well as empowering them to develop the skills and confidence fully participate in all levels of society (social inclusion) using digital technology as a tool.  Dates of the Youth Exchange: 17/08/2015 - 24/08/2015. \r\n \r\nThe following working methods will be used during the youth exchange: theoretical inputs on various aspects of communication, information and ICL and exercises (simulations, consensus and confrontation exercises, workgroups, etc.); presentations of best practices; role play and simulation exercises; workshops on management of a peer group, inter-cultural communication, peer on peer communication;  volunteer work as a way to pick up new job skills, presentation of the Erasmus+ Programme with a special focus on new developments and opportunities for cooperation between the partners on the project\u2019s theme.\r\n\r\nThe impact and results that we anticipate will be an identification and acknowledgment of the issues related to unemployment and   finding concrete solutions to address these problems. We anticipate that we will be able to further spread our findings and knowledge to other youth organizations active with the issues of practicing peer education as a tool to promote social inclusion and increased employability of young people.  The active use of these solutions with continued refinement through feedback and communication should result in  dissemination of the results to include a wider and wider audience,  and sustainment of these practices via support through youth leaders and partner organizations. This project will give the young participants an opportunity to organize informal peer led activities for their peers and local community, while accepting feedback on the chosen methodology and to be active citizens through volunteering.   The skills learned in this exchange are not only applicable to unemployment but can be expanded to form a broader base for life learning experiences in general allowing for improvement in knowledge, skills, thought processes, engagement in active citizenship, volunteerism, intercultural dialogue, intercultural tolerance, and increased communication skills.   These long term, synergistic benefits will help to propel forward a more inclusive and better attitude towards active citizen participation throughout Europe and the surrounding countries.", "http://www.ukyouth.org", "UK Youth", "erasmus_2014-3-UK01-KA105-011985_coordinator"], [2016, "Challenges and Changes in Youth Information and Mobility", "UK Youth", 15358.0, 5, 6, "Youth Information Outcomes Those working in youth information will benefit from improved competences, linked to their professional profiles particularly through experiencing other examples of practice and examining the impact of policy on their work Staff and managers will attain greater understanding of interconnections between formal and non-formal education, vocational training and the labour market particularly as there will be dedicated sessions on these. By beginning to work together participants will gain a greater understanding and responsiveness to social, linguistic and cultural diversity.The scope for increased ability to address the needs of the disadvantaged will be improved as will increased opportunities for professional and career development by interacting with fellow practitioners and managers from other countries. A greater understanding of the practice and policy environment will lead to increased motivation and satisfaction in their daily work.The organisations will gain increased capacity to operate at EU/international level as this is central to the work as are internationalisation strategies. The focus on the EU and Council of Europe plus an emphasis on the impact on policy will lead to reinforced cooperation with partners from other countries. The increased allocation of financial resources (other than EU funds) to organise EU/international projects will be examined in the planning stage, these might include active labour market or mental health funds. Given the centrality of the EU and the Council of Europe to the subject matter an increased quality in the preparation, implementation, monitoring and follow up of EU/international projects will be key. While the focus of the project is the policy making process, the examination of practice will also contribute towards innovative and improved way of operating towards target groups. Similarly, we see changes to youth information as an improved youth work method and practice to actively involve young people and to address disadvantaged groups. The focus on communicating practice to decision makers will also lead to a more modern, dynamic, committed and professional environment inside the organisation: ready to integrate good practices and new methods into daily activities. Core to the work on improving the policy environment is being open to synergies with organisations active in different social, educational and employment fields and the sessional plans reflect this. A focus on policy and decision making will assist planning strategically the professional development of staff in relation to individual needs and organisational objectives. Inclusion Outcomes A core aim of the project (and in moving to a KA2 application) is improved competences, broader understanding of practices, policies and systems in education, training or youth across countries relating to the issue of migration. A deeper understanding of the policy backdrop is also provided for.  Similarly, a core outcome will be an increased capacity to trigger changes in terms of modernisation in dealing with new client groups. Working on the issue of migration will foster greater understanding of interconnections between formal and non-formal education, vocational training and the labour market respectively. Longer term (particularly in moving towards a KA2 application) better quality of work and activities in favour of students, trainees, apprentices, pupils, adult learners, young people and volunteers from migrant backgrounds will be a key outcome as inevitably will greater understanding and responsiveness to social, linguistic and cultural diversity and more work to address the needs of the disadvantaged. By its very nature work in migration means increased support for and promotion of mobility activities for learners and as a newer type of youth work will entail increased opportunities for professional and career development and improved foreign language competences; As workers often mention the need for more support in this field, responding to this will mean increased motivation and satisfaction in their daily work.Given the importance of EU and international developments in this field and the plan to move to a KA2 application an increased capacity to operate at EU/international level with improved management skills and internationalisation strategies plus reinforced cooperation with partners from other countries is a critical outcome for the partners. An increased allocation of financial resources (other than EU funds) to organise this work may draw on national funds or private sector donations. Again given the centrality of EU policy in this field (regardless of opt outs) an increased quality in the preparation, implementation, monitoring and follow up of EU/international projects is expected. One of the key outcomes in moving towards a KA2 application will be an innovative and improved way of operating towards new target groups of migrants, by providing", "http://www.ukyouth.org", null, "erasmus_2016-2-IE01-KA105-016960_1"]]}}}}
