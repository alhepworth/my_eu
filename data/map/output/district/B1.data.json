The IoE will implement the real time interface between the power network/grid and the Internet. The grid will increasingly rely on smaller, locally distributed electricity generators and storage systems that are based on plug & play principles. Power network devices and loads at the edge (such as electrical vehicles, buildings, electric devices, and home appliances) can be charged or connected on any source of energy being solar, wind, or hydroelectric. Reference designs and ESs architectures for high efficiency innovative smart network systems will be addressed with regard to requirements of compatibility, networking, security, robustness, diagnosis, maintenance, integrated resource management, and self-organization. The future smart grid will converge with the Internet based on standard interfaces, and a physical infrastructure to support electric mobility and the efficient distribution of power and information. IoE will provide a robust, accessible and programmable platform that creates applications and services facilitating an increased use of renewable energy sources as fast as is feasible in a cost effective manner.

In particular, the project will focus on non-formal learning in peer health education that uses community sport and physical activity as the primary method of initial engagement with young people with fewer opportunities.  European Youth Health Champions will create an innovative training and learning resource adaptable for different national settings that can be rolled out Europe-wide. \r\nThis project will focus on young people with fewer opportunities, aged 14-25.  In times of austerity and high youth unemployment across Europe, this project is timely as it will focus specifically on disadvantaged youth.\r\nThe project will boost the skills of young people and increase their employability. The project will also improve and modernise youth work education and training. \r\nThis project incorporates an experienced group of eight partners from six countries, which are UK, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Italy, and Malta.\r\nEuropean Youth Health Champions is innovative because our genuine and adequate needs assessment has indicated there is a limited evidence base within the EU of the impact of peer education on the health and physical activity levels of young people. This project will create that evidence base. This project will create significant added value. It will pool the existing good practice occurring within the participating countries.  By bringing together eight  experienced and high caliber partners from six countries, the project will achieve a higher standard of outputs and results than could be produced in any one country alone. \r\nAll of the project partners are experienced in using grassroots sport and physical activity to engage young people with fewer opportunities. Because the eight partners are well known to each other, having worked together effectively in the past and spent time developing this project, they will form a dynamic and coherent partnership. \r\nWe have created a robust cross-sectoral approach to achieve the highest impact for this project.  Project partners represent the youth sector, the training sector, the public health sector, the grassroots sport sector, and the local authority sector. The inclusion of ISCA (International Sport and Culture Association based in Denmark) as a project partner will ensure the project results receive intensive dissemination and exploitation using their extensive networks across Europe.\r\nThe project will last for 24 months, which is the right amount of time to conduct a robust evaluation of all existing peer health and physical activity education programmes for young people, pool knowledge into new resources and internationalise them, test the resources by training up a new cohort of European Youth Health Champions from each country, refine the resources, and develop an innovative online learning portal for the finished project resources.\r\nOur comprehensive needs analysis has involved extensive desk based research, inquiries to governments and NGO\u2019s,  and concluded that there is a need for a new accredited qualification to train young peer educators in health and physical activity in the participating countries. Our needs analysis also indicates a wider need across Europe. The UK partners, which are StreetGames , Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), and Birmingham City Council, all offer valuable expertise in peer education by young people with fewer opportunities in the field of health and physical activity.

It will enable young people to connect and begin to share ideas and skills in order to meet our wider agenda of making our young people feel more European, raise their levels of aspiration and motivation to reach their full potential. In doing so they will become our youth mentor and ambassadors in the community. This will draw the youth element out of the project empowering young people to discuss the issues they face and develop solutions together.The principle of the exchange is around building a world in which sport is an essential lever, as playful as peaceful, to bring populations together. Physical and sporting activities form a whole language with its own universal reach. The activity program for the week will not only look to develop and improve individual skill and ability around there individual sports, but will also be the conduit to developing  a whole range of life skills through social inter action with other young people in different settings from different countries. The program will also look to provide learning on the culture and history of Lyon with arranged trips to key facilities in Lyon that will provide support in develop language and communication skills as well as empowering young people to develop greater feelings of being a European citizen, as they are from disadvantaged backgrounds so this will widen their knowledge of different European cultures - an opportunity they would not have had before.

AND RESPONSIBLE ANTIBIOTIC USE", "British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy", "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is widespread. Its global human and economic burden is tremendous and increasing annually. Yet today only a few pharmaceutical companies retain active antibacterial drug discovery programmes. While the elaboration of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action is scientifically complex, the chief challenge is diminishing incentives. Pre-market regulatory requirements and increased control on post-market access, use, and pricing of new antibiotics are strong deterrents to drug development. Meanwhile, healthcare payers are not currently prepared to reimburse antibiotics at prices that would support the cost of development.\n\nApplied to antibiotics, a simple sales-based economic model contradicts the public health mandate to reduce their consumption in order to preserve their efficacy. Alternative models that can create incentives for the discovery of novel antibiotics and yet reconcile these incentives with responsible antibiotic use are long overdue.\n\nThe multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder DRIVE-AB consortium composed of 16 public and 8 private partners from 12 countries will produce new models in a stepwise yet interconnected process.  To achieve this objective, the DRIVE-AB consortium has put together a strong team that comprises both currently active researchers on the antibiotics problem and new researchers who can bring a fresh perspective as well as experience from other industries, economic specialties, and business cultures. The academic team has been enriched by EFPIA members and stakeholders from various backgrounds. With this diverse, yet closely tied team, DRIVE-AB will deliver fresh, sustainable solutions to this complex problem.\n\nFirst, we will develop an evidence-based, consensus definition for \u201cresponsible antibiotic use,\u201d which, with its standardised quality and quantity indicators, will provide the framework for all later steps. Next, data from surveillance systems, antibiotic prescription databases, and published literature will inform estimations of the present burden of antibiotic resistance from both clinical and economic perspectives across varying socioeconomic backdrops. Simulation models informed by these data as well as data from past and ongoing epidemics will estimate future public health needs and impact related to AMR, again in diverse socioeconomic settings. Together these constructs will allow for valuation models that will estimate the true value of existing and new antibiotics from the perspectives of patients, physicians, payers, and society as a whole. These, in turn, will inform the creation of alternative economic strategies and reward models that will promote and sustain the development of new antibiotics while simultaneously bolstering appropriate use of existing antibiotics. The most promising schemes will be presented to policymakers and other stakeholders with attendant implementation and risk-management strategies.\n\nThis ambitious project will not succeed if it is developed and championed merely by one sector of society, be it academia, \u201cbig pharma,\u201d or public health. The robustness and applicability of the proposed alternative models will only be proportional to their level of input from all involved players. All work from beginning to end will be performed in close collaboration with the consortium\u2019s stakeholder partners, which run the gamut from patients and clinical societies to small- and medium-sized enterprises, large pharmaceutical companies, healthcare payers, public health officials, and government officials. The DRIVE-AB consortium will dedicate considerable resources to this collaboration and to the final dissemination of information to policymakers and the wider public.\n\nOverall, we are confident that the work of the DRIVE-AB consortium will have an immense impact. This is an unprecedented gathering of experts and stakeholders, led by renowned experts in various fields of medical, public health and economic sciences, to solve", 221961.0, 7479831.0, 12, 23, "DRIVE-AB", null, null, null, "fp7_203717_949850094"]]}}}}
