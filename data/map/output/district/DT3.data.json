This achievement is a great challenge, realizing diversity of technologies applied for security and the tremendous resources to provide it all over Europe. The Security sector is widely recognised as a key asset for the future of Europe and World. Security is a concern for everyone. New ideas and developments are needed to improve the research capabilities of the actors involved and to improve the security of European citizens in general. However, Security is also by common standards a very unusual business requiring specific rules, namely: it works on very long lead times, requires huge capital sums for developing its products and research and also requires a strong relation between all the organisations involved in the area. Europe needs to invest in Security targeting at the Industrial and research communities in order to address today\u2019s and future challenges in this specific Sector, especially with respect to society and its political, demographic, social and economical evolutions. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to build and maintain a highly competitive environment and this is only possible if the full integration of business processes across enterprises (involving key suppliers, usually SME) throughout the entire supply chain is achieved. In order to accomplish this to the maximum extent, the SecureCHAINS project will take the necessary steps to review the present status, scrutinize available resources and initiate a dialogue with the stakeholders and integrators of the security \u201cbig projects\u201d.

These areas tend to be of high economic value and are heavily used for a host of functions (e.g. fisheries, recreation, industry, etc.). Any of these uses may pose a threat to marine wildlife and habitats. The UK government has adopted legislation (UK Habitats Regulations) which provides for management schemes to be established for marine SACs, designed to make sure that any uses of the sites are compatible with the conservation needs of the habitats and species of European interest. \n\nThe project was to establish the first of these schemes on 12 sites around the UK and pave the way for others.\nThe selection of the 12 sites targeted by the project reflected the range of habitat types and species for which UK marine SACs had been proposed. Developing management schemes would involve collating information on the features of nature conservation interest, specifying conservation requirements and monitoring needs, and defining the factors (environmental and human activities) affecting site quality. At the end of the project, management schemes were to be established at the 12 selected marine sites. These would define the nature conservation interest of each site and what is required to ensure that the key features \u2013 such as bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay or Zostera habitats along the north Norfolk coast - are maintained, how to check for changes and how to respond if detrimental changes are detected.\n\nThe project would be operated by a consortium of the UK nature conservation agencies. Its key innovation was the partnership approach with main marine user interest groups and specialists, including port authorities, fisheries authorities, local and regional councils, scientific research institutes and recreational interest groups. \n\nThe experiences gained under this project should also be of benefit to other marine SACs in the EU.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=81", "http://www.ukmarinesac.org.uk,", "life_82"]]}}, "5ST": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Trainees in Europe", "Homestay and Venture Breaks", 99110.0, 3, 3, "The Louise-Schroeder-Schule, College of Office Management and Public Administration, www.osz-louise-schroeder.de, is a public educational institution that offers academic courses for a range of occupational fields in the sectors of business management, public administration, and media and information services. The College is divided into four departments. In two departments courses are given for students who train in the German dual system, the other two department offer full time courses that lead either to a degree as an assistant of office management or to  the German high school diploma with a special focus on extra studies in law and economics. About 3200 students are taught and trained by 160 teachers. \r\n\r\nThe majority of the students who do their academic part of the dual training in our college do their practical part of the training in federal, federal state or university and research institutions. The academic teaching  includes \u2013 in addition to the usual curricula \u2013 courses or modules in public law, economics, politics and citizen-oriented good governance. \r\n\r\nSince 2002 the college has been taking part in international programs in the context of the European Mobility programs Comenius and Leonardo da Vinci mobility projects and transboundary traineeship combination. In 2007 the college founded a separate office for its international activities. Since then it has been active under the name traineeINeurope. A team of six colleagues is responsible for the different international programs and their development and the internationalisation of the school in general.\r\n\r\nSince 2004 ca. 350 students have been sent abroad to public institutions and private companies to do 2-6 month internships in the administration, in libraries or in offices. Among our partners are public and private institutions, private companies, and universities.\r\n\r\nOur partners are in Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Norway, Hungaria, the Netherlands,  Poland,  Sweden, Spain and Turkey. \r\n\r\nActually about 45 students take part in the placement program every year. \r\n\r\nWe are constantly keeping contact to our partners abroad and are acquiring new partners to guarantee high quality placements for our students, also by visiting the partners personally. \r\n\r\nThe college has long-term cooperations with different national and state institutions in Berlin and Brandenburg which support the international programs, i.e. by organizing the yearly handover of the EU mobility certificates together with the college, http://www.osz-louise-schroeder.de/html/europass-ubergabe.htm.\r\n\r\nTraining our students for the international market therefore is an integral part of the academic program of the college.

They pass the whole 4th term abroad where they complete an internship as administrative assistants.\r\n\r\nLanguage skills can be proved by taking part in different nationally and internationally recognized language tests (KMK-certificate, DELF, Cambridge BEC).\r\n\r\nAll these activities aim to help students gain qualified competences for a more and more open and international labour market.", "http://www.homestayandventurebreaks.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000156_1"]]}}, "6LZ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1377993600000, 1472601600000, "Enabling Next Generation Composite Manufacturing by In-Situ Structural Evaluation and Process Adjustment", "Loop Technology Limited", "Within current composite part development and manufacturing processes a disproportional high effort is implied in order to find optimal process parameters and to meet required qualities and tolerances of high performance light weight structures.\nThe ECOMISE project proposes a breakthrough production system to enable next generation of thermoset composite manufacturing and post-processing. Within this new approach high precision process techniques for advanced dry fibre placement (AFP), infiltration (RTI/ RTM) and curing will be developed in order to maximize process efficiency at reduced costs and production time due to less material consumption, higher reproducibility, less energy, less waste and less rework.\nIn detail, innovative online process monitoring systems, probabilistic process simulation methods as well as a new method for in-situ structural evaluation of resulting composite properties will be developed, followed by a new knowledge-based method for in-situ process adjustment with respect to initial structural requirements. In this novel way, the required structural performance of the final composite product can be linked and assured during every manufacturing step, yet serving qualification issues at the earliest stage. Advanced characterization and testing techniques will be utilized and tailored to evaluate the process efficiency for required product quality by focussing on process robustness and throughput rate. Hereupon, the reduced carbon footprint is evaluated during manufacturing and in-service.\nThe resulting economic benefits of the ECOMISE approach will be evaluated and demonstrated by pilot implementations for industrial use-cases, considering particularities for volume part (automotive), large part (aeronautic) and thick complex part (marine) productions.
