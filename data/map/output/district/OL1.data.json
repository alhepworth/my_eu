Every European country, including the countries of this partnership (Georgia, Poland, Slovakia, Great Britain) experience this problem, albeit in different dimensions and with different intensities.\r\n \r\nThe theme of our project is to involve young people with fewer opportunities in the context of the labor market of the partner countries.\r\n \r\nAs a result of the observed social changes and in consultation with the Partners, the Jagiellonian University Extension (Wszechnica Uniwersytetyu Jagiello\u0144skiego) has decided to use its know-how in the area of \u200b\u200bsocial involvement.

The performance will be unfinished. Spectators of the spectacle (who will recruit youth representatives with fewer opportunities) will play the role of main characters (young people) and improvising (interacting with employer, social environment and other \"players\" of the labor market) will try to improve the situation of this person. This will allow them to learn to analyze, understand, experience, look for solutions, and work towards social inclusion - which will result in increased realism and ability to implement such change in their lives.\r\n\r\nThe performances will be preceded by a generational education workshop (O2), and the event will culminate with an analysis of the activities being undertaken on the stage and elaboration of the conclusions by the spectators and participants of the spectacle.\r\n\r\nPROJECT GOALS:\r\n1.

Alter-narration will be a premium example of action learning involving a multitude of new skills for participants. The premise of Alter-narration is to empower young people within different geographical regions to conduct capacity building via digital means that relate to their existence in the EU youth policy. The aim of the project is to inform and inspire positive action. Once engaged,  users will be presented with a communication bridge to influencers and a plethora of engagement options that inspire positive action. Users can explore content produced to help combat hate speech and radicalisation \u2013 specific to their region.

Relating to this point all content will be shareable via social media options. \r\n\r\nSocial media and Internet have given free access to recruit young people to extreme ideologies that increasingly leads to violent behavior. The main aim of Alter-narration is to increase capacity of youth organisations and youth workers to combat hate speech and violent radicalization in online spaces by developing methodological approaches and tools that will support their work in inspiring young people to create positive and alternative content online. Essentially, we want to empower youth workers and their organisation, and ultimately young people, with tools on how to counter xenophobic online narratives.\r\n\r\nThe journey of the project and the findings shall live on a newly created dedicated digital platform. The platform provides a 360 insight to each partners work, sharing not only the findings but also the methodology used. Rather than your typical research or educational resource report, the findings are shared in the format of dynamic and engaging multimedia online content consisting of animation, photography, video and audio. This project relates to the premise that youth organisations and youth workers are being asked to deliver more work with less resources in many EU countries and so a proven and trusted resource platform is required and needed across Europe. The lack opportunities to participate actively  to combat hate speech and violent radicalization in online spaces as well as opportunities to positively design relevant digital materials and resources  are addressed through this project.
