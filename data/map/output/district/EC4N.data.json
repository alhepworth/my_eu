However, this situation is bound to change considering that the greening of the transportation sector is imminent and unavoidable. This tendency is manifested with activities ranging from regularly published statistics regarding the air pollution of general industrial activity up to the Energy Efficiency Design and Operation Index that are currently being considered at IMO.\nThe greening of shipping operations has to do with more than just the amount of NOx, SOx and CO2 gases emitted at any period of time: the fact that for every tonne of fuel burnt approximately three tonnes of CO2 are produced indicates that the environmental performance of ships is linked to their cost-effectiveness. As a result, consistent energy management onboard will become a priority for rule compliance, and robustness against unpredictable financial fluctuations.\nAcknowledging that newly build ships will comply with the environmental regulations from the outset and will be more advantageous in comparison to existing ones, REFRESH will address the aspects of retrofitting that are essential for improving the energy efficiency onboard. The central concept of REFRESH is the dynamic energy modelling, i.e. the simulation of the energy production, consumption and losses over time. This idea will be implemented in a decision support tool that will allow onboard and ashore personnel to monitor the performance of the ship and adopt appropriate practices as a function of its operational profile.\nThe objectives of REFRESH are:\n\u2022\tDevelopment of dynamic energy modelling routines;\n\u2022\tOptimisation of the energy efficiency and air emissions for retrofitting and operation;\n\u2022\tDevelopment of a monitoring and management methodology for operation; and\n\u2022\tDevelopment of a decision support tool for operation.", 245527.0, 3428767.0, 7, 19, "REFRESH", "http://www.refreshproject.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2014/149933.jpg", "fp7_102394_959630216"]]}}, "6HN": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY ROYAL CHARTER*CBI", 150377.0, "Coordination and surveillance of, and communication on, the economic and monetary union, including the euro (01.02.01)", "fts_2017_42429"], [2016, "CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY ROYAL CHARTER*CBI", 150200.0, "Coordination and surveillance of, and communication on, the economic and monetary union, including the euro (01.02.01)", "fts_2016_41448"], [2016, "CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY ROYAL CHARTER*CBI", 3162.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18563"], [2016, "CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY ROYAL CHARTER*CBI", 971.0, "Other management expenditure (01.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_44162"], [2017, "CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY ROYAL CHARTER*CBI", 929.0, "Other management expenditure (01.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_40158"], [2017, "CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY ROYAL CHARTER*CBI", 624.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_20223"], [2016, "CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY ROYAL CHARTER*CBI", 272.0, "Other management expenditure (33.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_26852"]]}}, "7HB": {"cordis": {"data": [[1317427200000, 1412035200000, "SENSE-PARK: Supporting and Empowering Parkinson patients in their home environment using a Novel SEnsory information system that monitors daily-life-relevant parameters of PARKinson disease and their", "The Cure Parkinson's Trust", "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and prevalence increases with age. This leads, in an aging society, to increasing personal, social and economic burden. To date, basically only symptomatic treatment is available, which application almost always leads to the feeling of dependence and lose of self-control in (a) person(s) with PD (PwP's). A further shortcoming in PD-related treatment is the limited quality of disease state-defining parameters. Recent ICT-associated projects have mainly been focusing on the 'observation' of the user rather than giving feedback to him/her, and they bear little resemblance or application to the reality of living with PD. In addition, obtrusive measurements influenced results in particular in PwP's due to disease-caused neural network changes.The aim of the SENSE-PARK project is to develop an unobtrusive and empowering information system for use in the home environment, which provides the users with practical, engaging and motivating tools to monitor patterns in their condition. In more detail, the SENSE-PARK system will inform the users about motor and non-motor functioning in daily life activities ('being', data collection via RFID sensors and a wrist-worn data logger), leisure activities ('belonging', data collection via gaming console and adapted interface) & scientific environment ('becoming', for validation).The project will include PwP's at central positions to ensure the development of a user-friendly and effective system, and consequent dissemination. In addition, with the SENSE-PARK system, disease course-associated parameters which are provided to the user can also be provided to the doctor, to enable an intense and transparent at-the-point discussion between two specialists of the disease.

The main goal of NABARSI is to find new chemical entities (NCEs) with antibacterial efficacy in animal models of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infection and to exploit the results through obtaining a co-development with industry. The NABARSI consortium consists of 5 partners: Omnia Molecular (Omnia, SME; Spain). InhibOx (SME, UK). Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis (LIOS, Latvia), Leeds University (Leeds, UK) and Erasmus Medical Centre (ErasmusMC, The Netherlands - Coordinator).\nAntibacterial activity will be achieved through inhibition of essential aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS). Individual aaRS are highly conserved across bacteria, enabling the discovery of broad-spectrum antibacterials. To reduce the likelihood of resistance, NABARSI will look for NCEs with inhibitory activity against multiple aaRS enzymes. InhibOx and LIOS will design NCEs by rational and fragment based drug discovery methods followed by synthetic structure optimization. To increase chemical diversity, virtual screening of large (>100 M) compound libraries available at InhibOx will be performed. Limitations of previous aaRS inhibitors will be overcome by novel approaches such as the In Omnia assay: activity of the compounds on pathogenic aaRS enzyme is measured inside a human cell, allowing rejection of compounds acting through human aaRS and identifying compounds that cross biological membranes. The expertise of Leeds in mode of action studies will be used at an early stage. Activity of the NCEs on clinical isolates of MDR strains available at ErasmusMC will be assessed. Resistance appearance frequency and mechanisms will also be assessed early by selection and characterization of resistant mutants by ErasmusMC and Leeds.
