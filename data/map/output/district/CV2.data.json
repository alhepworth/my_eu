These two features co-exist in most patients but some patients present with only emphysema (E) or only airway disease (A). The aim of the project is to identify markers specific to E and A of COPD. Our hypothesis is that the mechanisms leading to these pathologies are distinct with respect to the type of inflammatory response and in terms of genetic predisposition. The differential pathogenesis for emphysema (E) and inflammatory airway disease (A) entails that in the two forms of COPD are linked to different markers at the DNA, RNA and protein level. Using computer tomography (CT) scans  for selection of  patients with emphysema only and airway disease only, we will obtain material from lung (leukocytes, bronchial cells) and blood (leukocytes), and will analyse elements of gene expression (SNP array, transcriptome). Data analysis will be done for E versus A (EvA) and versus a control cohort leading to identification of markers linked specifically to either E or A.  These markers will be elements involved in a differential pathogenesis for the different disease processes in COPD. They can be used for diagnostic approaches and as therapeutic targets.", 161270.0, 3434197.0, 10, 15, "EVA", "http://www.eva-copd.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2011-08/45926.jpg", "fp7_87739_998888444"], [1298937600000, 1467244800000, "Airway Disease PRedicting Outcomes through Patient Specific Computational Modelling", "University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire National Health Service Trust", "The airways diseases asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease affect over 400 million people world-wide and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Airways disease costs the European Union in excess of \u20ac56 billion per annum. Current therapies are inadequate and we do not have sufficient tools to predict disease progression or response to current or future therapies. Our consortium, Airway Disease PRedicting Outcomes through Patient Specific Computational Modelling (AirPROM), brings together the exisiting clinical consortia (EvA FP7, U-BIOPRED IMI and BTS Severe Asthma), and expertise in physiology, radiology, image analysis, bioengineering, data harmonization, data security and ethics, computational modeling and systems biology. We shall develop an integrated multi-scale model building upon existing models. This airway model will be comprised of an integrated 'micro-scale' and 'macro-scale' airway model informed and validated by 'omic data and ex vivo models at the genome-transcriptome-cell-tissue scale and by CT and functional MRI imaging coupled to detailed physiology at the tissue-organ scale utilising Europe's largest airway disease cohort. Validation will be undertaken cross-sectionally, following interventions and after longitudinal follow-up to incorporate both spatial and temporal dimensions. AirPROM has a comprehensive data management platform and a well-developed ethico-legal framework. Critically, AirPROM has an extensive exploitation plan, involving at its inception and throughout its evolution those that will 'develop' and 'use' the technologies emerging from this project. AirPROM therefore will bridge the critical gaps in our clinical management of airways disease, by providing validated models to predict disease progression and response to treatment and the platform to translate these patient-specific tools, so as to pave the way to improved, personalised management of airways disease.", 705.0, 12552591.0, 11, 40, "AirPROM", "http://www.airprom.eu", null, null, "fp7_97980_998888444"]]}, "nhs": {"data": [["RKB", "University Hospital (Coventry)", "nhs_RKB01"]]}}, "2FT": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "European HD Youth Camp 2016", "Huntington's Disease Youth Organisation", 10327.0, 6, 9, "The European HD Youth Camp 2016 is an arrangement for adolescents/young adults who share heavy challenges living with HD in the family.  They have a parent who has the hereditary, neurodegenerative disease - Huntington's disease (HD). Many children growing up with a sick parent take a lot of responsibility to take care of their parent.  At the same time they have 50% risk of having inherited the disease themselves. Shame, guilt and denial are very common phenomena  in HD families.  A lot of those affected by the disease feel very alone. The goals of the camp will be to improve knowledge, develop skills, gain empowerment, create support and being together a cultural exchange. During the camp the participants will have the opportunity to get in touch with other young people in the same situation.  They will, through good information, activities and discussions, get a better understanding of many of the aspects and emotional reactions to HD.  In the program there will be a focus on team-building to ensure that the participants establish best possible relations with each other so they can seek support and understanding during and after the camp. 39 Young people and 6 young adult volunteers from United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and Norway will be together with 5 staff leaders for 5 days.  The camp will be held in Grosvenor Hall, Kent, England.  The camp program will be a mix of teambuilding activities, workshops, information, group discussions cultural activities and leisure activities. We expect the camp to have a powerful impact on the lives of these young people and long-term we feel camp will enable these young people to believe in themselves, overcome the barrier of HD in their lives and achieve the goals they set themselves (whether that be educational, career or life achievements) - we want them to aim high. It is not uncommon to see a change in attitudes from participants on their future path in a positive way and that is our long-term goal for camp participants.", "http://www.hdyo.org", "Huntington's Disease Youth Organisation", "erasmus_2015-3-UK01-KA105-022864_coordinator"]]}}, "2TE": {"nhs": {"data": [["RYG", "Caludon Centre", "nhs_RYK53"]]}}}}
