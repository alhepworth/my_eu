The complex parasite biology requires a multifaceted approach targeting multiple life cycle stages and virulence pathways. The pathogenesis of the most deadly of human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, is related to the capability of infected red blood cells to sequester in deep tissues. Sequestration is critical for the completion of the red blood cell cycle because the release of parasites into the blood circulation allows recognition by surveillance macrophages and clearance in the spleen. A series of studies have since led to the understanding that sequestration of asexually replicating parasites is caused by the adherence of parasite infected red blood cells to the vascular endothelium of various tissues in the body.\n We have recently demonstrated that gametocytes, the only stage capable of transmission to the mosquito vector, develop in the extravascular environment of the human bone marrow.

Recently however, DUTs have been involved in the control of relevant cellular processes. How these regulatory functions are controlled remains unsolved. The recent elucidation of the mechanistic role of DUTs in the transfer of staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) by our group has revealed an entirely novel and surprising strategy involving DUTs in signalling. Namely, we have demonstrated that in addition to the 5 classical domains present in all the trimeric DUTs, staphylococcal phage-encoded DUT proteins possess an extra region (Motif VI) involved in SaPI de-repression by binding to the SaPI-encoded repressor (Stl). Although this domain is necessary, it does not suffice to induce the SaPI cycle. Unexpectedly, the strongly conserved DUT motif V is also inherently involved in mediating de-repression. Crystallographic and mutagenic analyses have demonstrated that binding to dUTP orders the C-terminal motif V of phage-encoded DUTs, potentially rendering these proteins in the conformation required for SaPI de-repression. In contrast, conversion into the apo state conformation by the hydrolysis of the bound dUTP disorders motif V and generates a protein that is unable to induce the SaPI cycle. Analogously, previous work demonstrated that the trimeric rat DUT interacts with the transcriptional factor PPAR\u03b1, an interaction that depends on an \u201cextra\u201d N-terminal motif VI present in the DUT protein and requires the C-terminal domain contribution, strongly supporting in general the mechanism involving DUTs in signalling.

There is pronounced variation in these two neglected components of metabolic profile, uncorrelated with that in resting metabolism, and increasing evidence that they may influence species distributions. I point out that these different components of metabolic rate are inextricably linked to levels of mitochondrial uncoupling, and hence to energy efficiency, potential oxidative stress and senescence. I predict that different microhabitats will favour specific combinations of metabolic traits, leading to spatial and temporal structuring of metabolic phenotypes within and across populations. This project aims to test this new framework in a multidisciplinary project that uses experimental manipulations at levels ranging from the cellular to the population. The project combines cellular analyses and cutting edge technology with carefully designed experiments in an ecological setting. I will test whether variability in metabolic traits is maintained through context-dependent fitness. If successful, the work will reveal how metabolic physiology is a key determinant of the ability of organisms to cope with variable environments, so explaining the persistence of variation in physiological traits and increasing our understanding of the likely consequences for organisms of environmental change.", 1850597.0, 1850597.0, 1, 1, "METAPHEN", null, "http://www.gla.ac.uk", null, "fp7_107855_999974165"], [1396310400000, 1553990400000, "Advanced Microfluidics & Diagnostics using Acoustic Holograms \u2013 Bio-Phononics", "University of Glasgow", "This proposal seeks to develop a novel technique for fluid and particle manipulations, based upon exploiting the mechanical interactions between acoustic waves and phononic.

The phononic lattice comprises a miniaturised array of mechanical elements which modulates the sound in a manner analogous to how light is \u201cpatterned\u201d using a hologram. However, whilst in an optical hologram, the pattern is created by exploiting the differences in refractive indices of the elements of the structure, here the ultrasonic field is modulated both by the elastic contrast between the elements in the array, as well as by the dimensions of the array and its surrounding matrix (including the size and pitch of the features within the array).

InflammaTENSION will result in the discovery of novel biomarkers, capable of identifying patients who could benefit from such immune targeted therapies.

However, our current knowledge remains very fragmented and so far has not been applied to human pathology. InflammaTENSION will for the first time advance the knowledge procured in rodent models into human studies.

We lack experimental studies that track telomere loss within individuals subjected to varying environmental circumstances and relate this to organismal level outcomes for parents and offspring.

The SQL is comprised of the inevitable combination of sensing noise (photon shot noise) and back action noise (photon radiation pressure noise) when repeatedly measuring the position of a test mass. However, by measuring a different variable, i.e. the test mass velocity (speedmeter) instead of its position (position-meter), it is possible to evade back action noise. The momentum of a free test mass can be measured continuously to arbitrary accuracy without being limited by the SQL. Since a Sagnac interferometer is sensitive only to the time-dependent part of the arm-length difference it is automatically a speed meter and therefore brings measurements beyond the SQL into our reach.\n\nTheoretical analyses have shown that the speedmeter approach is the most promising track towards wide-band sub-SQL measurements. An experimental test of this technique is urgently required! Therefore, my three main objectives of this proposal are: 1) Realisation of an ultra-low noise, quantum radiation pressure dominated speedmeter test bed. 2) Experimental demonstration of back action noise supression in a Sagnac speedmeter. 3) Development of speedmeter based sub-SQL interferometery for future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope.\n\nBy the end of this project I will have demonstrated the sub-SQL potential of the Sagnac speedmeter configuration.

Current practise relies on the conversion of acoustic energy to thermal, for localised and minimally-invasive ablation with non-ionising radiation. Cavitation (the formation, and subsequent pressure driven dynamics, of bubbles) is a common occurrence at the high intensities typically employed for FUS. The extremely rapid, often violent evolution of cavitation in tissue exposed to focused ultrasound, poses a high risk of collateral damage to healthy tissue proximal to the site of pathology. TheraCav will demonstrate cavitation can be controlled and harnessed, to redefine the remit of FUS to include targeted drug delivery and rapid ablation formation via enhanced heating. Conceptually, cavitation could act to significantly permeabilise targeted tissue, rendering specific volumes highly susceptible to drug delivery through extravasation from the vasculature. Moreover, cavitation may actively pump and promote drug transport directly to the diseased tissue. If cavitation is to fulfil this potential, however, it is crucial that precise monitoring and control strategies are developed, demonstrating that it can be safely introduced and utilised tissue. Through a series of novel and ambitious objectives, TheraCav will develop techniques and devices to deliver this capability, calibrated against a recent innovation that has allowed the direct observation of cavitation at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.

The programme equips students with the tools and critical skills necessary to make sense of the history, theory, institutions and cultures of global and local capitalism. Students will be encouraged to explore a variety of perspectives on the process and experience of globalization, and to reflect on the relationship between global and local, in particular, of cities, creative industries and local cultures of entrepreneurship that have innovated at the local level to remain globally competitive. Students will receive a theoretical grounding in international business and the global economy, and be encouraged to think critically about the respective roles of individuals, firms, cities, regions, nations and supra-national bodies in determining the world in which we live.  Rooted in multidisciplinarity, it is designed for students with a diverse range of prior knowledge and interests and will develop their understanding of the process, impact and responses to globalization. Exploration and understanding of the intersecting complementarity of global and local is at the heart of this interdisciplinary programme. Students will spend one semester at the Universities of Glasgow, Scotland and Barcelona, Spain. In the third semester students choose between a track on the history of globalization and the role of creative industries delivered at the Erasmus University, Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and a track specializing in marketing, entrepreneurship and development at Goettingen University, Germany. The final semester will be spent researching and writing a dissertation. Students will graduate with a multiple degree: one from each of the three universities at which they studied.

It brings together the recognised strengths of our individual programmes into a relevant degree that engages with and responds to key issues of our time, such as social inequality, migration and intercultural cooperation and collaboration. Its curriculum aims at enabling people to work with adults effectively and competently in changing socially diverse contexts. IMAESC is a joint master's degree delivered and awarded by the following universities: the University of Glasgow (UK), the University of Malta, the Open University of Cyprus and Tallinn University (Estonia). This programme also has an optional summer school in Penang at the Universiti Sains Malaysia. Adult education has been recognised in Europe as a critical element in addressing the key international economic and social challenges of our time. Thus IMAESC students receive a theoretical grounding in adult education, as well as intercultural and practical skills development trough teaching placements, focused seminars and online courses. A distinctive feature of this programme is the connection between theory and practice gained through mandatory mobility periods between the partner universities. The programme includes three focused placements in semesters 1, 2 and 3 designed to provide a depth and breadth of experience across three European contexts (Scotland, Malta and Estonia). The first placement in Glasgow focuses on adult learning and teaching in the context of community regeneration.  The second placement in Malta allows students to gain experience in teaching English to migrants. The final focused placement takes place in Estonia and relates to two topics: professionalization of adult education and recognition of prior learning. After having completed two placements and two, possibly three, semesters of study, at Tallinn students start focusing on their own professional development.  They work with the Estonian Adult Education Association and map their experience to the Estonian Competency Framework, which allows students to crystallise their learning gained through coursework and placements into a recognised EU credential. For the students who choose to join a Summer School, the focus is on sustainability and peace studies in Malaysia. IMAESC graduates have found employment in the higher education sector including international and UK universities, the education sector in general, local councils, adult literacy centres, international non-governmental organisations, private sector companies and healthcare departments. Students have three or four mobility periods, having the opportunity to spend a semester and an optional summer school at a relevant partner university. The language of instruction is English.

Such talented students may struggle within mainstream education for any number of reasons: socio-economic difficulty; or underachievement through lack of challenge; multiple exceptionalities masking or hindering the development, to name just three. To address the needs of these students on European level would require the coordination of educational institutions across Europe; changes in national educational policies with regard to the highly able; development of pan-European and transnational mechanisms for the training of teachers to support highly able students, among other actions. Within this context, this project aims to build upon a body of educational practice and research that has been developed by a number of institutions across Europe. We aim to address the training of teachers in a contextual and innovative manner, providing an Open Educational Resource (OER) online, available to teachers throughout Europe, and indeed the world. This OER will take the form of a five stranded professional development resources which will cover the identification of gifted students; their lived experience; social-emotional support of the highly able; differentiation strategies for mainstream classes; and the development of curricula suited to gifted students. Each of theses five strands is underpinned by three guiding principles: addressing underachievement in gifted students by helping them reach their potential; addressing equality of access to such differentiated instruction for all students from all backgrounds; and the support of students who are multiply exceptional, students whose high ability is coupled with other special educational needs.

What are the chances of a change in weather conditions? More important questions and decisions in life are also quantitative in nature. What is the risk of a medical intervention? What are the potential benefits of an investment? Answers to these essential questions are usually provided in terms of statistics and quantitative information. Large modern societies require that quantitative information is communicated effectively so that it can be used by active citizens to make informed decisions.

Regulations do not change mentality.\r\n\r\nWhat teacher educations need is therefore inspiration, concrete examples and role-models to learn from and follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore we must make such resources available to teacher educations, and it is the mission of Teacher 2020 to contribute to the availability of such resources.\r\n\r\nThe most important characteristic of such resources is that it empowers teacher educations and teachers to create their own experience and entrepreneurial pathways; or, in short, empower them to drive their own entrepreneurial fluency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mission of Teacher 2020 is therefore to produce such resources and make them openly and attractively available to teacher educations and teacher students across Europe.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the project includes serving as a preparation for a 2016-19 Knowledge Alliance on entrepreneurship in schools, generating the needed experience and platform for such a higher level initiative, and joining forces with similar initiatives at European level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key results of the project will be:\r\n\r\n- Teacher2020 \u2013 The project\u2019s open virtual platform, including inspirational and guidance scenarios of entrepreneurial fluency in teacher education \u2013 www.Teacher2020.eu\r\n\r\n- Go entrepreneurial! hand-outs addressing key entrepreneurial learning challenges in teacher education\r\n\r\n- Designing the 21st Century Teacher Knowledge Alliance application\r\n\r\n- Policy recommendations on entrepreneurial fluency in teacher education to the Commission, educational policy-makers and funding programmers\r\n\r\n- Special report: Creating entrepreneurial fluency among the new generations of school teachers \u2013 opportunities and obstacles\r\n\r\n- Sharing results through local events and European campaigning in selected professional social networks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concentrated and focused project partnership includes teacher educations and practice schools from all European regions: Spain, the UK, Italy, Romania and Denmark.", "http://www.gla.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA201-004463_6"], [2015, "Open The Doors - New Directions in NEET prevention through teacher capacity building", "UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW", 109745.0, 7, 10, "Open The Doors - New Directions in NEET prevention\r\n\r\n\u201cTeachers cannot teach how to be entrepreneurial without themselves being entrepreneurial.

This is why most of these settings are based on a practical and manual work. \r\n\r\nIronically this means that NEET prevention can result in learning prevention. \r\n\r\nPotential NEET youth and NEET youth are indeed able to develop strong intellectual and learning capacity, given the proper opportunities and learning settings.\r\n\r\nIt is an important element in the open the doors to community didactics to break through this inertia of depressed mentality in NEET prevention environments \u2013 including all levels of those environments \u2013 by inviting different kinds of players from other sectors, and with different mentalities, to join and engage in the projects and activities created with and for the youth groups.\r\n\r\nTo create new capacity in NEET preventions to support the learning of 21st century competences among the young people, Open the Doors needs to address and work with the professional staff in these settings, mostly teachers, social educators and youth educators.\r\n\r\nThe educational professionals are the gatekeepers of innovative didactics, allowing potential NEETs to re-engage in learning and initiative-taking.\r\nTherefore Open the Doors is missioned to create new didactics for NEET prevention THROUGH building 21st century didactic capacity among the professionals.\r\n\r\nIN CONCISE FORM THE PROJECT WILL BUILD 21ST CENTURY NEET PREVENTION CAPACITY AMONG NEET PREVENTION EDUCATORS THROUGH ENGAGING THEM IN CONCRETE PROJECTS WITH THE YOUNG TEAMS AND THE COMMUNITY, BASED ON THE PROJECT\u2019S 5 FUTURE-ORIENTED METHODOLOGIES: REAL-LIFE LEARNING, LEARNING IN MIXED REALITIES, WORKING WITH COMMUNITY, ENTREPRENEURIAL INITIATIVE-TAKING AND USING CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe capacity building of the educators will result from the interaction between such practical experimentation and the collective reflections systematically included in the project.\r\n\r\nThe DOCUMENTATION of project\u2019s extensive capacity building among participating educators will generate NEW KNOWLEDGE, on which the project\u2019s final outcomes will be based \u2013 offering rich didactic guidance to a wider audience of NEET prevention educators across Europe.\r\n\r\nIn summary the objectives pursued by Open the Doors therefore are:\r\n\r\n- To create new capacity in NEET preventions by working with the professional staff in the prevention provisions, mostly teachers, social educators and youth workers\r\n- To innovate in the didactics of NEET prevention by applying the 21st century entrepreneurial learning, linking the youth interest with the community needs and creating practical learning processes\r\n- To build capacity among NEET to re-engage in learning, community and work\r\n- To link this new experience to the education institutions responsible for training the new generations of teachers and youth workers\r\n- To upgrade the recognition of the NEET prevention institutions\r\n- To produce experienced based documentation to share among education institutions in order to unify the criteria in NEED prevention\r\n\r\nOpen the Doors builds on and offers 3 major pillars of innovation:\r\n\r\n- Teachers\u2019 competence development through the dialectics of practical real-life experimentation and systematic collective reflection and documentation\r\n\r\n- Developing and producing future-oriented 21st century re-engagement didactics for potential NEET youth, reversing the traditional practical and manual learning pitfalls\r\n\r\n- Creating open virtual guidance for wider European audiences directly based on knowledge generated by the project practice and co-created by the participating educators and youth teams\r\n\r\nNEET prevention settings and NEET prevention educators thus need to open the doors to dramatically new and future-oriented didactics based on:\r\n\r\nREAL-LIFE LEARNING\r\n21ST CENTURY LEARNING METHODS IN MIXED REALITIES \r\nWORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY \r\nENTREPRENEURIAL MIND-SETTING AND INITIATIVE-TAKING\r\nCREATIVE TECHNOLOGY \r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s NEET prevention didactics innovation will materialize into the following key results:\r\n\r\nGuidelines for 21st century NEET prevention\r\n\r\nAre you a NEET prevention worker?\r\n\r\nEuropean NEET Prevention Guidance Service\r\n\r\nWhat NEET prevention NEED\r\n\r\nFunding NEET prevention facilities?\r\n\r\nThe Open the Doors hand-out collection\r\n\r\nAre NEETs not able to learn?

With modern approaches and based on tradition, we want to give children best foundation for life in the future society. We want to create a learning environment that does not limit the child to what adults think we can do and we do not want to explore solutions or decide with yesterday's logic, but with a prudent search for new ways. We have passion and dedication, and we are constantly wondering how far from the comfort zone we are ready to go, so that the children can learn new things. By seeking the balance between exploring and introducing new technologies, new approaches and internationalization, and preserving and awareness of the importance of cultural heritage, national identity and social inclusion, we want to act prudently in the present for the wise future.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to enable professional workers to develop their professional competences to improve the educational process. This will also include skills acquired through mobility; introducing innovative teaching methods, techniques and technologies, and extending the possibilities for European cooperation to modernize and internationalize the curriculum; strengthening the awareness of the importance of cultural heritage and improving the language competences and reflection on the future strategic orientations of the kindergarten.\r\n\r\nThe mobility project will include nineteen professionals, various profiles, who in their work, among other, are working on the development of the preschool profession, various pedagogical approaches, international project work, involvement of children from different cultural backgrounds, inclusion of children with special needs, including children from socially disadvantage groups, environments with fewer opportunities and immigrants, and identification and work with talented preschool children.\r\nMain activities: job shadowing and structured courses in the field of alternative approaches and new trends in teaching, creating encouraging learning environments, strengthening social skills, integration, internationalization, cultural dialogue and awareness of the importance of cultural heritage, promoting creativity and innovation, learning foreign languages, use of ICT and new technologies.\r\nThe project methodology is based on the strategic plan of the institution and the European development plan.

To challenge the gifted and talented children academically can be a challenge in itself.\r\nThis group of children often has difficulties in their social relations as well as fitting into \u201cthe normal classroom\u201d.\r\nThe end result is that these children often don\u2019t fulfil their potential or go as far in the educational system as their abilities allow them to. They often end up being underachievers who often do not reach their full potential.\r\nIt is important to support and nurture these children from an early age.

We would also like to obtain experience with the practice of teaching these children through visits to schools that have different programs regarding the gifted and talented.\r\nOn the basis of all the above reasons, we have put together a project that consists of visits to various organizations that: \r\na) work with the daily challenges of teaching this group of children \u2013 both as an integrated part of a \u201cnormal\u201d class \u2013 and as a group consisting of only these type of children.\r\nb) work with supporting the well-being of these children and focus on the relationships between the gifted, talented and the average children.\r\nApart from these visits, we have chosen a university-based course that will give our participant a strong theoretical background within this area.\r\nA smaller group of staff, both teachers and the personnel of the principal\u2019s office, will, furthermore, be going on a course to work on the school\u2019s strategy and specialization within the gifted and talented children area.
