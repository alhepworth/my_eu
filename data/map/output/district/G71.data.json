This course will be fully completed and complemented by the immersion course in Spain.  As a follow-up the teachers will confidently implement and teach Spanish in accordance with the four capacities contained within the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence guidelines.\r\nAlso, they will ultimately share their learning with others whom they will train as future facilitators of Spanish to pupils throughout the school.  The techniques learned and used will be applied to other modern languages, such as French, since our pupils will be learning both languages.  This will include both teaching the language, culture and geography and historical aspects of Spain/France.  A variety of methodologies and strategies will be used and in particular the use of ICT to enhance the learning and teaching of Spanish.  We will continue to use the resources on the platform provided by LFEE which will ensure our use of ICT with the pupils.  We will use the methodology of active learning to involve and immerse our pupils in the language of Spanish.  This will involve us making use of games and songs, especially in the early stages of primary school where we will concentrate on the talking and listening of the modern language.  As our pupils become more confident we will ensure that they are using the four language skills of talking, listening, reading and writing.  We will also follow the guidelines issued by Education Scotland that outlines exactly what material the pupils should be learning at each primary stage of school.  At present Education Scotland has got P1 stage ready and is working on the other stages of primary school.  Doing all of this will ensure that Spanish is embedded into the life of our school.  Included in this are the parents who will be informed and given the opportunity to discover more about their child's learning in this area.  At the same time, we intend to share our knowledge and good practice with other cluster schools in our network, other schools in Scotland via Education Scotland website and European colleagues via links established on immersion course and platform.", "http://www.stjohnthebaptistprimary.org.uk", "St John the Baptist Primary", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001998_coordinator"]]}}, "8BB": {"cordis": {"data": [[1322697600000, 1385769600000, "Device for prophylaxis and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers for hospital and home use", "Nhs Lanarkshire", "In PreventDFU, we propose to develop an advanced prototype for prophylaxis and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). This condition contributes to morbidity and loss of Quality of Life (QoL) of Diabetes Mellitus sufferers, most especially the elderly.  We propose to develop a unit prototype, based on our proprietary pulsating negative pressure technology that can be used at home or nursing homes, for treatment of DFUs, and their prevention.\n\nOver 55Mn Europeans between 20 and 79 years of age are currently suffering from diabetes; 55% above 60 years old. The incidence of diabetes is expected to grow as the population ages. Diabetes sufferers have a 12 to 25% lifetime risk of developing a DFU. Over 8Mn Europeans coudl be suffering from DFU in their lifetime. A morbid display of DFU is the lower limb amputation; 85% of the amputations in diabetes sufferers are reported after unsuccessful DFU treatment this means between 290,000 and 450,000 amputations per year, an annual cost  in the order of \u20ac2 \u2013 2.5Bn.\n\nWe believe that introducing PreventDFU technology for home and nursing home use for the primary purpose of DFU prophylaxis during sleeping hours and for the secondary purpose of assistive therapy of mild DFUs may reduce DFU incidence in the elderly and prevent a significant number of DFU-related toe, foot and leg amputations. If Prevent DFU technology can only help 5% of the DFU sufferers, this would mean substantial QoL improvement for over 400,000 Europeans and over 2 Mn sufferers worldwide, substantially reduce associated healthcare costs and give a considerable boost to the European Medical Device Manufacturing, Nursing and Assisted Living sectors. PreventDFU technology could benefit elderly pressure ulcer (PU) suffers by providing timely prophylaxis by increasing the blood flow in the legs; it has been reported that 95% of all pressure ulcers occur in the lower part of the body while 70% of those occur in persons over 65 years of age.", 13340.0, 1035355.0, 4, 9, "PreventDFU", null, "http://www.nhslanarkshire.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/62343.jpg", "fp7_101250_962436426"], [1354320000000, 1425081600000, "Safe, Chemical-Free, Cleaning of Hospital Ward Surfaces", "Nhs Lanarkshire", "Cleanward aims to develop a novel, safe, user-friendly anti-microbial cleaning system, using titanium dioxide coated ultra-microfibre fabric that will integrate easily into existing contract cleaning equipment: it will achieve log105 microbial removal and the coating will react with water and UV to produce a highly reactive environment: this will kill all harmful micro-organisms quickly and thoroughly without the need for chemical disinfectant \u2013 all in an isolated, low water volume unit.
