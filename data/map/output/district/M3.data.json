Much of this growth will have to be accommodated on existing lines that contain old infrastructure. This demand will increase both the rate of deterioration of these elderly assets and the need for shorter line closures for maintenance or renewal interventions. However, interventions on elderly infrastructure will also need to take account of the need for lower economic and environmental impacts. This means that new interventions will need to be developed. In addition tools will need to be developed to inform decision makers about the economic and environmental consequences of different intervention options being considered.\nMAINLINE proposes to address all these issues through a series of linked work packages that will target at least \u20ac300m per year savings across Europe with a reduced environmental footprint in terms of embodied carbon and other environmental benefits. It will:\n- Apply new technologies to extend the life of elderly infrastructure\n- Improve degradation and structural models to develop more realistic life cycle cost and safety models\n- Investigate new construction methods for the replacement of obsolete infrastructure\n- Investigate monitoring techniques to complement or replace existing examination techniques\n- Develop management tools to assess whole life environmental and economic impact.\nThe consortium includes leading railways, contractors, consultants and researchers from across Europe, including from both Eastern Europe and the emerging economies. Partners also bring experience on approaches used in other industry sectors which have relevance to the rail sector.\nProject benefits will come from keeping existing infrastructure safely in service through the application of technologies and interventions based on life cycle considerations.

For these reasons existing vibration-based Condition Monitoring System (CMS) usually fail to detect defects until they become critical.\nThis project will show the applicability of the CMS enabling the prompt detection of defects. The proposal idea is to use this experience to deploy an existing system that:\no\tAllows an early detection and identification of any developing defects on several components of the wind turbine such as blade cracking, slip-ring corrosion and shaft/bearing misalignment, thus helping to optimise the maintenance schedule.\no\tCombine the use of several sensors in order to evaluate the overall operational condition of the turbine\u2019s generator, gearbox bearings, main shaft and blades.\no\tUse wireless sensor for rotating components monitoring using high performance powering and energy harvesting technologies.\no\tFuse and analyse the data obtained through the different sensors using a single SCADA system.\nBroadband radio transmission systems were developed to transmit the data from fixed or rotating frames to the ground without losing any signal resolution. The results indicate the feasibility of collecting AE signals from the rotating frame with acceptable level of noise in low to moderate wind speeds. Also other developments were executed in order to verify whether or not the noise level increases appreciably with wind speed and whether such signals can be filtered out.\nApplication of CMSWind system:\n\u2022\tThe Gearbox (including Main bearing, Yaw System, The hub)\n\u2022\tThe Generator\n\u2022\tThe Bolting\n\nOne of the aims of this project is to develop new standards and procedures for applying offshore instrumentation and therefore providing generic developments and information of use to the whole Wind Energy and NDT industry.", 39002.0, 2100650.0, 6, 11, "CMSWIND", "http://www.cmswind.eu/", null, null, "fp7_103871_964286410"], [1375315200000, 1469923200000, "Demonstration of methods and tools for the optimisation of operational reliability of large-scale industrial wind turbines", "Sinclair Knight Merz (Europe) Limited", "The power output from wind turbines has increased dramatically over the past thirty years from 50 kW to 6 MW, while 8-12 MW turbines are in the stage of design. State-of-the-art condition monitoring systems, such as vibration-based systems and temperature sensors, are able to monitor and evaluate the current condition of components of interest. Nonetheless, varying wind loads can result in the generation of false alarms or even misinterpretation of the data collected. In addition, commercially available condition monitoring systems offer no or very limited prognostics capability with regards to the remaining lifetime of a component before a serious fault occurs. Therefore evolution to predictive maintenance strategies is currently impossible. Experience has shown that by combining disparate data sources wind farm operators will be able to move from common reactive maintenance approach to a more cost effective risk-based operation and maintenance strategy with a high level of predictive maintenance scheduling. OPTIMUS will develop and demonstrate in the field novel methods and tools for prognosis of the remaining lifetime of key components based on data acquired by a cost-effective wind turbine condition monitoring system implemented by custom-designed dependable computing systems. This technology will reduce the total cost of energy and advance the deployment of large scale offshore and onshore wind energy by increasing availability and reducing downtime due to unplanned maintenance. Predictive maintenance will also reduce costs incurred from secondary damage to components and enable maintenance activities (and the associated costs) to be optimized with respect to forecast revenue from power generation.
