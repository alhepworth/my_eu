The world of multimedia changes rapidly.  Youth workers need to understand and capture this environment to ensure relevance and ongoing enhancement of the young people they work with.  In turn, young people need to be supported to use their skills in this virtual world of communication to enhance and not isolate - to develop associations with each other both virtually and also in real time. This project will bring three groups of young people together within a moderated online progressive gaming environment to develop technical and collaboration skills as well as encouraging engagement with and an understanding of the communities in which they live. Participants will work together to locate, design and construct the town, researching and negotiating the various considerations and dilemmas inherent in such a project. The work will be undertaken within their country teams and in collaboration with the teams in the other two countries. Participants will base the designs on replicating buildings in their own towns, thus encouraging them to get out and learn about their own built environment. They will also be encouraged to research the housing of vulnerable groups, refugees, travellers, disabled people and the homeless within our communities.

In the course of these activities, we have found that the value of outdoor education is not always understood; the process of how to set up outdoor centres is not well documented; and local authorities, businesses and others do not always appreciate the potential economic and business opportunities associated with outdoor education services. Access to appropriate facilities and activities, professional standards, and public regulation vary from country to country, so many young people are excluded from the opportunity to participate.\r\n\r\nThis new multi measure project builds on previous experience and brings together partners both from countries which already have good outdoor facilities and from others which are in the process of developing these; and individual participants with different levels of knowledge and experience. The aim of the project is to develop a network of outdoor education practitioners capable of becoming a resource for mutual sharing of knowledge and experience, providing further training and advice to others, organising international youth exchanges, and promoting high professional standards at a European level. The project will result in the publication of a multimedia resource pack for developing outdoor education centres, activities and programmes in different places and contexts.

They bring information to life by talking about their own experience in Europe and why this has helped them. Originally established in Germany, EuroPeers is now expanding to a number of other countries. Our project \"Hands Up for EuroPeers\" aims to support and expand this process, starting from the UK where Momentum World is leading this initiative.The original and ongoing aims of the EuroPeers are:\u2022 To raise awareness of European issues and activities among young people\u2022 To make their peers aware of the importance of social commitment\u2022 To share experiences of Europe and being European citizens\u2022 To show how cultural diversity can be brought to life\u2022 To encourage young people to reflect critically on EU policy\u2022 To demonstrate courage, tolerance and entrepreneurial spiritThe project is important because of the current debates about the future of the EU and the limits of mobility - particularly in the UK with the forthcoming referendum. Although EuroPeers (and this project) is not political, we do see it as a means of encouraging a better quality of informed debate among young people, and of emphasising the youth dimension within the generaI public discourse on Europe.It is also highly relevant to the needs of young people: for those who have completed EVS or other projects, it provides valuable follow-up experience and a means of further transversal (employability) skills development; and it also provides accessible information to other young people and multipliers (teachers, youth workers, parents) who may not know about the opportunities Erasmus+ can offer.Our project thus has 4 aims:1. To promote Erasmus+ opportunities to more young people and potential beneficiaries in the participating countries2. To support the development of the UK network, and encourage and promote similar current or prospective initiatives in other countries3. To build shared strategies and share best practice for networking between partner organisations and directly between young people involved in EuroPeers or similar networks.4. To empower young people as active citizens at the heart of European discourse.The project will consist of 3 activities based in the UK and Germany: training / study visit for project managers; training of trainers; and training of youth leaders for EuroPeers. There will be a total of 80 participants including professional project managers, trainers and young people aged 18-21. Many more will be reached in each country during the follow-up activities. 11 countries are involved in this project, namely Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey and the UK.Overall, the results of the project will be:1.

Is professionalism damaging volunteering ?  \r\n\r\nAlso the levels of expectation around all services delivered has risen to an extra ordinary level , evidenced by huge rise of  professional coaching now being delivered to young children in the GAA .The comparisons now between professional sport and amateur are not as whimsical as a decade ago.

The internet and mobile phone technology is continuing to revolutionise the way we interact with each other. This phenomenon is more apparent among young people where simple communications now appear in the form of images, icons have replaced the written word, emoji icons used to describe emotion, snapchat has replaced the text message of yesteryear. Groups of young people can now gather in virtual youth clubs for social interaction . How do we make the youth club relevant to them ?  \r\n\r\n\r\n3. Irish society now has a diversity in its communities than did not exist in the past .How do we reach out to these new communities how do we make them feel welcome to volunteer . \r\n\r\nThis is further evidenced by the dramatic rise is Microvolunteering*  a\u201c bite-size volunteering with no commitment to repeat and with minimum formality, involving short and specific actions that are quick to start and complete\u201d which is many ways is the antithesis of what young work needs where relationship building, commitment, time and patience are the watch words . \r\n\r\nThe event will be delivered through a programme of  presentations,  discussion, events, actions, activities, conversation in relation to art in youth work. The programme will aim to connect different cultures and experiences of  youth work.

The course will introduce them to the benefits of international work, and give them the confidence to get involved in this. There will be 35 participants (including staff) from 9 countries (Croatia, Greece, Lithuania, Spain, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine and UK).\r\n\r\nThis project aims to address the issue that youth workers are often reluctant to get involved in international work. In the UK and many other European countries, international youth work is undervalued and misunderstood. Even at the best of times, it tends to lack support from policy makers; but in times of austerity, it becomes a low priority for funding and the first target of cuts. Youth workers are neither resourced, nor trained, nor encouraged to get involved in international work. They do not know how to get started; they may lack the confidence to do so, they may be too busy with day to day case work, or they may not appreciate the positive impact international experiences can have on young people. If they have not experienced this themselves, it is even harder for them to begin.\r\n\r\nOne of Momentum\u2019s aims is to increase young people\u2019s access to international projects. We cannot do this by ourselves, and so we need to encourage more youth organisations to \u201cgo international\u201d and get started in European projects. \u201cInto Europe\u201d is intended as a practical course, which will take youth workers to another country, in a very different cultural setting, and give them a first hand experience of their own. When they return home, they will have the confidence, motivation, knowledge and skills to pass on these opportunities to the young people they work with. Through Momentum and our European partners, they will also have access to support networks and partner projects (especially youth exchanges) which will be easy to manage. This will become a ladder of opportunities up to the point where they will start building their own partnerships and making their own Erasmus+ applications.\r\n\r\nThe course will be organised as a \"youth exchange for youth workers\" based on simple intercultural learning activities. Each day\u2019s activity will be followed by an in-depth review session so that participants can understand the methodology, benefits, risks and practical issues for every activity. There will also be an introduction to Erasmus+. At the end of the course, participants will go home with a simple action plan. Youthpass will be used as the framework to capture and validate learning, and video diaries will record personal development throughout the week.\r\n\r\nThis is the second in a series of these courses, each involving a different set of countries and partners. This course will take place in Florina, Greece with a total duration of 8 days in September - October 2015. The reason for this choice of location is to ensure that participants are taken somewhere relatively unfamiliar, culturally interesting, and physically safe. This will maximise the learning opportunity. The Greek participants will be in the role of hosts, which is also vital to successful international projects (but will have the opportunity of attending a future course held in another country).\r\n\r\nThe project meets the objectives of Erasmus+ by promoting the mobility of young people and youth workers and developing the capacity of youth organisations across Europe to get started in international project work, thereby delivering benefits to young people much more widely.", "http://www.momentumworld.org", "Momentum World Community Interest Company", "erasmus_2015-2-UK01-KA105-014083_coordinator"], [2017, "\u201cLeaD in Practice\u201d", "Momentum World Community Interest Company", 21246.0, 8, 8, "\"LeaD in Practice\u201d [Learning Design in Practice - LeaDiP], a blended-learning project (combining distance with on-location training) has been set up to address all the unprocessed, unspoken and unresolved issues and \u201chot potatoes\u201d that repeatedly emerge during Erasmus+ youth exchanges and training courses and that are usually missed in Training of Trainers courses. \r\n\r\nThe project aims at achieving three goals with one action: (1) Improve the competences of youth trainers/learning facilitators in areas which are typically left untouched in training processes, so that they can develop and offer high quality learning projects to their organizations\u2019 learners, while (2) employing the principles of Intercultural Dialogue to do so.

We want this, in so far as possible, to be based on research into documented experience and evidence in order to strengthen the case for review of policy and practice.    \r\n\r\nThe objectives is to have an \"open method of coordination\" a discussion around youth integration and the role that civil society can play in this process. Over the past decade there has been a huge interest in Youth Work. There appears to have been an enormous effort made at European and national level to understand and articulate the value of youth work in the context of inclusion and active citizenship. The National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) was established in 2010 as a necessary support and development tool for the youth work sector. The rationale was five-fold \r\n\u2022 \u201cto provide a support and development tool to organizations and projects;\r\n\u2022 to establish standards in the practice and provision of youth work;\r\n\u2022 to provide an enhanced evidence base for youth work;\r\n\u2022 to ensure resources are used effectively in the youth work sector;\r\n\u2022 to provide a basis for \u2018whole organisational assessment\u201d (NQSF, 2010, p.1)\r\nEuropean and Irish youth policy has taken enormous steps forward over the past decade since the 2001 White Paper: A New Impetus for European Youth (2001)  the  National Youth Policy 2015-2020, a European Youth strategy 2010-2018 and the seminal Better Outcome Brighter Futures 2014-2020 (BOBF)  The standard and quality of youth work has never been higher , yet the number of Youth Clubs both national and locally in Tipperary have been dropping .The level of migrant youth engagement in clubs is low as is the role played by youth leaders in advocating on their behalf. \r\nIn Tipperary the youth board has been very proactive in this respect. They have spearheaded a campaign on behalf of Ibrahim Halawa, (a young Irish man of Egyptian heritage) and have supported the resettlement of Syrian Refugees in Thurles.      \r\n\r\nDevelop a Future collaboration Project Outline\r\nThis action research project will identify, analyse, adopt and evaluate effective interventions by agencies with regard to the integration of young migrants into local communities. The project will place the young migrant and local agencies working with them at the centre of the collaborative enquiry. The project will also encourage the establishment of interagency reflective (evidence based) collaboration at regional level within the participating countries as well as encouraging the establishment of learning networks at transnational level within specific sectors.   \r\nPotential local Partners\r\nThe research will be undertaken within youth groups or other community based civil society organisations working with migrants. Research links will be developed through the project with local agencies entrusted with the integration/management of migrants, municipalities, health authorities, education, etc\u2026 these will be engaged at a small regional level (NUTS 3). The academic partners will oversee the research within their countries, ensuring the integrity of the research and also putting the action research into a broader theoretical context. The academic institutes will also have responsibility for ensuring consistency in the transnational dimension of the research.         \r\nPotential Transnational Partners\r\nThe scope of the research will seek to assess the interventions made by agencies prior to the departure of migrants from their home countries, as well as during the process of arrival, reception, transit and resettlement. The research collaboration will include partners from a country of origin for migrants (Ethiopia), countries of arrival (Grease, Italy), Countries of resettlement (Ireland, Sweden Germany, Netherland). The research will also include a third country into which there is a recent experience of youth migration from the participating countries, (Canada).  The rational for this is to create a shared \u201cfirst person\u201d learning context for the local agencies and civil society partners.  The inclusion of Ethiopian/Eritrean researchers will also ensure that the research focuses on the realities and urgencies of the contemporary migrant crisis. \r\nUnique Characteristic of this Project\r\nThis project combines principles of youth and community work with academic research in order to encourage reflective evidence based practice.

The youth exchange is going to be focused on cultural differences between 6 various nations in different continents. \r\nThe project topic is about understanding \"who are we and why are we who we are\" in regard to the country where we grew up, how much our heritage defines us and if are we actually really very different, even regarding the obvious difference of the background we come from. The reason for the creation of this project is a need for cultural understanding as well as a necessity of preventing radicalism and extreme attitudes. Those elements are crucial in our globalized interconnected society.\r\nWe have noticed that the issue is that many people do not really understand differences between the cultures. What makes us so different? Do we have similar values which are only hidden in different habits and traditions? What defines me in my home country and where is the barrier between me and the immigrant?\r\nThese and other questions we would like to open with the participants of the youth exchange \u201eWho am I and Why?\u201d.\r\nGenerally, the topic is significant in the context of people moving around the world. Moreover,  the situation is currently more intricate in regard to migrants and refugees.\r\nThe main objectives are to make participants understand broad concepts of cultures (their own cultures and foreign cultures) and being able to think critically about the knowledge we have and the information we receive and perceive. We would like to achieve that the participants are more open-minded and aware of diverse cultural contexts and unique effects of cultural heritage. Beside the main objectives, we would like to give space to the participants to increase their creativity through various activities.\r\nWe are planning to manage the project through thematic creative sessions ( workshops, playing a theatre, tandems, simulations, mind games\u2026) focused on history, traditions, values, languages, food habits, general lifestyle, and stereotypes. Most of the content in the learning process will be created from the big part by the participants  Moreover, we will involve in the process at least one cultural expert which can provide participants with an objective point of view and give a different educational input.\r\n8 leaders and 24 participants from 6 countries aged 18-23 from different backgrounds (some of them disadvantaged geographically of financially) are expected to take part in the project. We will invite local media (TV, newspaper) to inform about the project and make interviews with participants. One part of the project is a performance of theatre play \"Where the past meets the future\". On this occasion, we will invite also locals, mostly local youth, to watch the performance and afterward get in touch with the participants. We plan to spread the results (video, online poster, short messages, and photos) of the YE online through diverse social media using the #EuropeForCulture. \r\nIn a general range, we intend to devote the project to the creativity of participants and ability to express and understand themselves. We would like to achieve that they not only open their minds to other cultures but they are at the same time able to look at their own culture from a completely different point of view. \r\n*In the project is included an APV (an advance planning visit) which we are planning to realize - 01/06/2018-03/06/2018 - three weeks before the youth exchange will start.

This can not be complete without involving anyone on the other side, the stakeholders.\r\nIn fact, 24 foreign participants with 5 from Italy (2 participants, 2 facilitators and 1 staff) will attend the Seminar. The group will be composed of EVS youth workers and staff-youth workers, and representatives of private or public stakeholders active in the field of youth.\r\nThe participation of youth workers, formerly EVS volunteers, will be a concrete testimony to the skills, ability and support needed to make it easier to move from EVS to work. While the participation of local stakeholder representatives, coming from organizations active in youth policy and youth policy, represents added value in the ability to offer the project new prospects and possible collaborations or channels to exploit.\r\nThe activities of the Seminar aim to stimulate mutual sharing between participants on three main points: analysis of the issue of volunteer support at the end of EVS, identification of relevant stakeholders on this topic in different contexts and good practice present on this topic. The exchange of knowledge will provide the basis for the development of project ideas and initiatives to support post-EVS volunteers, which will encourage the development of innovative and sustainable responses - through networking with stakeholders - to the phenomenon.", "http://www.momentumworld.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-IT03-KA105-011419_7"], [2014, "Leadership for employability", "Momentum World Community Interest Company", 19337.0, 8, 8, "Project Leadership for employability is prepared In cooperation with organizations from United Kindgom, Italy, Turkey, Romania, Armenia, Albania and Georgia.

We want our teachers to be able to communicate in Spanish to schools abroad, not only in Spain but other Spanish speaking countries. By achieving this, we will be increasing the global dimension of our school and create greater community cohesion. The aims of the project are to develop the learning of a new language and embed it in to our curriculum to make sure it is broad, balanced and inspiring.  We aim to learn about the educational system in Spain,  to learn new methodologies and to develop a link with a Spanish school that will continue after the completion of the projects funded by Erasmus. We want to develop the use of Spanish so that we and our pupils can communicate with other schools. This will have a positive impact for raising achievement and community cohesion. We aim to run more projects related to languages in the school to give language learning a greater context and give children an idea of what it means to be part of Europe. The aim of both projects is to make staff more aware of what it is to be European, what life is like in a different major European city and share this with the children. \r\nThe project 'Bonneville goes to Spain' will run for 2 academic years. During this time, we will have 24 members of staff attending a language and cultural course for 5 days where we expect them to experience the Spanish life style while being immersed in the cultural and social aspect of Spanish life. This immersion will enhance the learning of the language and will also facilitate the use of language within context which will give a bigger impact then if they learn the language here. We expect our staff to return more enthusiastic about speaking a foreign language and more confident to deliver and embed Spanish in our curriculum. During the language courses, participants will also have the opportunity to visit a market of a park in order to use their language skills in a practical manner as well as seeing the language written in the form of signs. This again will have a greater impact on their lessons as they can use real life photos of the market and park as well as provide children with a greater idea of what it feels like being there. It will also provide the teachers with different ideas for using and embedding the language.  \r\nThe Job shadowing element of 'Bonneville goes to Spain' will consist of 4 visits across the 2 years involving 3-4 members of staff in each visit. The first visit will consist of the head teacher, the language tutor, me and the creative curriculum leader. The aim of this visit is to make introductions at the Spanish school and to strengthen the links between the schools. We will take this opportunity to look for similarities and differences between the schools and use these to assess how the project will continue. The next 2 visits will take place to strengthen the school link and enable the teachers to work more closely with colleagues in the partner school. By having 2 visits we can assess and re assess the impact of the project so far, amend the project if needed and then plan new projects. Whilst teachers are visiting the partner school they will observe teaching and learning, speak to staff and look at specific areas of classroom management. They will also look how different areas of responsibility are  managed and delivered. We will compare roles with our Spanish colleagues and looking at timetables, staff meetings, policies and the curriculum to name a few. On return we will identify areas at Bonneville for improvement to grow, to develop, to amend. Participants will run staff meetings and will disseminate the outcomes of each mobility to members of staff and the wider school community including the governing body.\r\nThe outcomes of the project will be to develop our global dimension resulting in us having a greater confidence in teaching Spanish, a greater understanding of European life especially for our EU children, improving the welcome package for non English new arrivals and forge greater links with families in our community. The EAL lead will be part of the management team and can use findings to support with projects such as Walcott. We look to improve provision to teach languages in school and improve teacher competencies to teach a foreign language which will be measured through lesson observations, action plans and book scrutiny. We will use etwinning which is new to the school and will help to establish communication with students and teachers.

In that sense a part of the project is that young apprentices mobilize their colleagues to participate in the project. \r\nThe project is not a part of the formal education system. The participants are all apprentices or young construction workers. The age is 16-30. \r\n\r\nThe theme of the project and the cooperation is work safety and working environment in the construction sector. During the 4 day long transnational meeting the young apprentices from Denmark and Wales will discuss and compare working environment and work safety on construction sites. The Danish delegation will visit construction sites, visit a vocational school, get presentations about the work safety in Wales from workers, and the union UCATT and get the possibility to compare the situations in the two countries. During preperation and follow up there will be a lot of focus on how to impact the EU policy makers. \r\n\r\nThe three main reasons to carry out this project are 1) to put more focus on work safety among young workers in the EU construction sector and 2) to reinforce and develope organization work and international orientation in the two partner organizations and 3) to kickstart a culture and tradition among young construction workers that they see themselves as citizens that actively take part in political discussions, and cooperate and learn from each other across boarders and organize and orientate themselves across boarders. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot travelling and exchange within the EU among high school students and university students. But among the young people attenting the vocational schools, very few take part in these possibilities. This is both a shame for the youth that choose the vocational educations but it also represents a problem within the EU. Is is certain parts of the population that benefit from the open boarders in the EU, it is a certian type of people that travel, visit the neighbour countries and start to feel like EU citizens. One of the aims of this project is to make a connection between young apprentices in the construction sector in Denmark and Wales. This project will give the young participants from both countries an experience that they have a lot in common with the youth other countries. \r\nThe participants will during the transnational meeting discuss work safety and working environment in the two countries. They will learn about the EU rules and regulations and gain knowledge about how the EU affects their everyday working life and how they can use their democratic rights to influence on the EU legislation. The program contain workshops and seminars where the participants will plan the future cooperation and activities. \r\n\r\nThe project period is 6 month and includes prepatory meeting for participants, the big transnational meeting and following activities and dissemination.
