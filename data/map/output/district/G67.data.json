This 8-day programme overseas is meant to contribute for the building of a solid structure for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle through sports  by concentrating on the benefits that may be gained by outdoor activities and an active lifestyle. Our previous project made us realize that sport plays a major role in promoting understanding, breaking down barriers and celebrating diversity. The main focus of this project is that of promoting an active life style through outdoor sports from an early age, where through various workshops and interest based discussions, issues such as levels of inactivity and obesity, the need to support and nurture emerging talent, and the formulation of worthwhile goals and performances from an early age are addressed. The programme will involve a mixture of workshops focusing on discussions about the importance of sport in our daily life and its' effect on our bodies to promote a healthier lifestyle.  \r\n\r\nWe are proposing an 8 day period programme in an EU partner Country (Scotland) where 10 young people from Malta, 3 of which come from a lower socio-economic group, will be placed in a sport environment to develop their vocational skills, knowledge and confidence in this sector as well as improve their continuing personality development. This exchange will be conducted between young people from two European countries, Kercem Ajax F.C. in Gozo, Malta as promoters and youths from Cumbernauld College in Scotland. The purpose of this exchange is to bring young Europeans to work together through diversity to overcome barriers to employment  by giving them an opportunity to learn what is happening in other countries in the sports and youth development sectors. The planned activities and working methods will contribute to the process of gaining new sports skills and also personal development skills including communication, customer service and teamwork through non-formal learning. During this youth exchange, whilst focusing on the main aim of promoting a healthier lifestyle through sports and outdoor activities, all the young participants will have the opportunity to discuss and confront various themes and also learn about each other's countries, histories and cultures.\r\n\r\nThe project will allow our youths to be hosted at New College Lanarkshire in Scotland in order to participate together with other youths in a joint programme of activities that promote a healthier lifestyle through sports, thus involving the active participation of a mixture of young Europeans which will allow them to discover and become aware of different social and cultural realities, to learn from each other, to develop an entrepreneurial spirit and reinforce their feeling of being European Citizens.", "http://www.nclanarkshire.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-MT01-KA105-000064_1"]]}}, "1JW": {"esif": {"data": [[1459468800000, 1538265600000, "North Lanarkshire's Youth Employment Initiative (NLYEI)", "North Lanarkshire Council", "Supporting young unemployed people aged 16-29 into education, training and employment", "ESF", 3590981.0, 5359673.0, "esf_scotland_246"], [1427846400000, 1546214400000, "North Lanarkshire's Working Employability Pipeline", "North Lanarkshire Council", "The operation will support participants with multiple barriers to progressing in the labour market through an employer engagement programme - assessing employers recruitment needs and matching opportunities for unemployed people; and provide warp around care including work based training, health interventions, debt & money advice, IT provision, vocational training, support with dependent care, literacy & numeracy.", "ESF", 3026606.58, 7566516.58, "esf_scotland_192"], [1443657600000, 1546214400000, "Business Advisory, Expert Help and Workshop Support", "North Lanarkshire Council", "Identify and work closely with 1624 SME\u2019s across Lanarkshire to develop growth aspirations, provide specific expert- help, specialist advisory services focusing on overcoming sectoral and market development / generic barriers to growth.", "ERDF", 1214048.96, 3035122.4, "erdf_scotland_78"], [1443657600000, 1546214400000, "Business Competitiveness Grant Support - Lanarkshire", "North Lanarkshire Council", "Grant support for sustainable business growth, helping SMEs to implement projects which safeguard or increase employment (with a focus on youth employment) and increase their turnover", "ERDF", 510000.0, 1275000.0, "erdf_scotland_79"], [1427846400000, 1546214400000, "North Lanarkshire Council Lead Partner Management and Compliance", "North Lanarkshire Council", "Strategic Intervention management, administration and compliance.", "ESF", 436442.87, 1091107.18, "esf_scotland_191"], [1443657600000, 1546214400000, "BG+ Lanarkshire Lead Partner Direct Staff Costs", "North Lanarkshire Council", "Management costs as permitted by national rules", "ERDF", 71960.86, 179902.16, "erdf_scotland_77"]]}}, "2DN": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Youth Exchange \u2013 Control Your Life: Personal Responsibility and Active Citizenship", "Cumbernauld YMCA", 10138.0, 8, 8, "We know that there are many young people across Europe, who deals with emotional and psychological problems and issues, deriving from the fact that they live in an achievement-oriented society.

That is why the overall objective of this project is based on the theme \u2018lose control.\u2019 The theme explores a duality in terms of lose control \u2013 take control. It encourages young people to come to terms with losing control with the acceptance that you cannot control everything and that is okay. The theme applies to young people all over the world, and can be perceived in many different ways, thereby making it suitable for a youth exchange. The project will be carried out as an APV (Advance Planning Visit) on the 27th to 28th of February 2016 and as a youth exchange on the 3rd to the 7th of July 2016. The participating countries are: Ukraine, Lithuania, Serbia, Macedonia, Scotland, Germany, Kosovo and Denmark. There will be 16 people in total participating in the APV, a youth participant and a leader from each country. There will be 60 youth participants and 16 leaders participating in the youth exchange. The youth exchange will consist of two parts: 1) the first three days of the youth exchange will function as an exploration, in Aarhus, where the young people will engage with each other exploring different themes and producing small activities/projects. This will provide them with the tools for the second part of the exchange, 2) the following two days, which will function as an experimentation, where the participants will take control and carry out their projects in practice, at the youth camp Wonderful Days, situated in the Western part of Jutland. Objectives of this youth exchange are in cohesion with the general objectives of the Erasmus+ programme. Additionally, the objectives of the project are to create strong citizens, to foster a sense of mutual understanding no matter the cultural or national background, by forcing them to reconsider themselves, their identity and the values they base their active citizenship on. Furthermore, the objectives are to create space for intercultural dialogue and to explore the different cultures through various activities, which tallies with non-formal and informal learning methods, such as workshops, presentations and teambuilding. The expected results will be that the participants obtain different non-formal competences from the youth exchange and disseminate those learned skills to other new possible relations, friendships and partnerships. Additionally, an improvement in the participants\u2019 intercultural skills, language and communication skills, their understanding of the value of democratic participation in the civil society will be expected. The potential long term benefits is that the intercultural experiences from the youth exchange will spread both to participating organizations and into broader civil society.
