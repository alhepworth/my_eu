The analysis realized starting from these activities of discussion and sensitization highlighted the need of implementing transnational mobility activities for the strengthening and updating of professional competences, both of recent graduates and staff, in the sectors identified in the project. In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y. VET - Experiences Abroad for Staff and Young graduates in VET\"  is part of the internationalization strategy of Essenia UETP, that foresees the implementation and the development of activities aimed at improving the quality and increasing the quantity of transnational mobility projects. \r\nBesides the transversal phases of management, monitoring and dissemination, the project foresees the implementation of the following activities, carried out according to procedures and methodologies already experimented over the years, and that guarantee high quality standards:\r\n-Information and sensitization\r\n-Selection of participants\r\n-Linguistic and pedagogical preparation\r\n-Logistic organization of mobilities\r\n-Evaluation of the project\r\n-Dissemination of project results\r\n-Follow-up\r\nThe quality procedures adopted are constantly improved and updated, also thanks to the use of new technologies and to the professional retraining of Essenia UETP\u2019s human resources, that occurs through training activities realized in the framework of Erasmus+ KA2 projects. Over the years, Essenia UETP  has further broadened its already wide network of European partners, identifying entities and companies able to offer transnational mobility experiences meeting high quality standards and preferring , among them, the ones of proved experience.  All over the National territory relationships with VET Institutes, public and private entities, companies have been consolidated  to assure congruence and coherence between the activities proposed and the needs of the users. At local level, Essenia UETP pursues  the objective of enhancing the cooperation with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the competences (ECVET), in order to make the  formal and informal competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market.", "http://www.africafashionweeklondon.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005687_1"], [2016, "S.T.Y.LE. - Supporting Traineeships for Young LEarners", "Africa Fashion Week London", 156355.0, 4, 11, "S.T.Y.LE. - Supporting Traineeship for Young LEarners is a mobility project lasting 24 months, promoted by a National Consortium coordinated by \"ISIS Novelli\" and composed, apart from it, by the  Vocational Institutes \"F. Trani\", \"F. Orioli\" and by Essenia UETP. The project foresees the allocation of 50 grants for the realization of traineeships in European companies operating in the Fashion industry and located in the United Kingdom, Spain and Lithuania. Beneficiaries of the mobility action will be 20 recent graduates and 30 students in the third and fourth year of studies in the sector \"Clothes and Fashion/Textile production\", coming from the Institutes members of the Consortium. Recent graduates will carry out the mobility within 12 months from their graduation and their traineeship will last 120 days (plus 2 days of travel), duration considered necessary to attain a complete training and professional experience. The traineeship performed by students will last 21 days (plus 2 days of travel) the presence of 4 accompanying persons  is foreseen. The promoters desire to realize this project to address the training and employment needs of the territories in which they are set, where the Fashion industry represents a relevant driver for the local economy and has got a huge potential of development. The fashion sector is composed by highly innovative companies with a great economical potential and it is one of the most dynamic in Europe, contributing for the 7%  gross national product of EU. It has high development rate and offers employment to almost 5 millions of people in Europe (Study on the economy of culture in Europe, 2006, \u201cCreative Economy \u2013 the Challenge of Assessing the Creative Economy \u2013towards informed policy-making\u201d, 2008).Anyway, the fashion sector requires highly qualified operators, with adequate practical and operational competences, transversal competences, including linguistic ones. So it is essential to provide young people  entering the labour market with practical skills and soft skills, to tackle unemployment, to allow companies to have adequate labor force, and, finally, to strengthen the productive capacity of territories. So, the objective of the project is to better qualify local human resources through the carrying out of international mobilities, focusing on the acquisition of technical and transversal skills required by the fashion industry, in order to make the professional profile of the participants more competitive on the labour market, contributing to increase their employability and to takle the phenomenon of massive migration of young people from the areas of origin. Carrying out a traineeship in European companies operating in the fashion industry will enable participants to integrate theoretical studies with practical activities, according to the philosophy of \"learning by doing\". During the traineeship they will be constantly monitored and supported by tutors who will assess their progress, and- at the end of the experience- the learning outcomes achieved, releasing the appropriate certifications.The experience will contribute to achieving the following results in the participants:- Improvement of practical and operative skills in the fashion sector and consolidation of technical and professional knowledge- Improvement of language competences, including the sectorial language of the fashion industry- Knowledge of different labor markets and other economies, new methodologies and practices in the fashion sector- Familiarization with social and cultural contexts of other EU countries, and strenghtening of European citizenship- Development of transversal communication, organizational and problem solving competences- Acquisition of  national and European certification expendable in the labor market- Upgrading and integration of the CV with new competences and experiences- Opportunities for recognition of competences acquired abroad (ECVET)- Improvement of the capacity of identification and evaluation of employment opportunities in the labor marketThe project will have a positive impact on the members of the Consortium, in terms of: capacity building of the organization and management of international activities with local and foreign partners; strengthening of strategies for internationalization and development, introduction of transnational mobility activities as \"systemic\"; updating of curricula to the needs of the area and the world of work.

Many national and international surveys have demonstrated consumers' generally low level of understanding of financial matters and of basic economics, at a time when financial system and products are becoming more complex and sophisticated, making them difficult to understand. Few adults have engaged in learning about finance because of a lack of capacity of adult training providers to offer such provision including the lack of competent teachers in the subject. \r\n\r\nThere is growing interest in financial education and the European Commission is supporting the development of capacity to offer it. Its profile has been increasing and it now features very prominently in some state education systems. It is now part of the school curriculum in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together providers of adult learning from different educational sectors to form  a strategic partnership, to strengthen the capacity of institutions to deliver financial education, enhance the professional development of staff and develop innovative approaches to learning including the use of digital technology to improve the overall quality of the provision and stimulate demand for financial education.\r\n\r\nWithin this broad aim the key objectives are to:\r\n1. Evaluate current approaches and practices in teaching financial education\r\n2. Determine the level of finance competence in finance among teachers \r\n3. Improve the pedagogical and financial competence of teachers\r\n4. Equip teachers with new tools to deliver financial education\r\n5.

Students feel sense of empowerment when they manage abroad: they can use foreign language and they are understood, they learn to manage money. They learn basic everyday skills of life. Their self-esteem increases as the students are able to manage abroad, although not alone, but away from their families. The main theme of the project is to increase students\u00b4 not only professional skills and competences but also social and communication as well as life management skills. This is taken into account in every stage of the project. \r\nProject partners have been chosen for the mobility keeping in mind the acquisition of the key competences. Partners are colleges, companies or intermediate partners with contacts to local companies. All the mobilities are work related and the spare time are partly structured cultural activities. \r\nThe goal of the project is to involve many vocational study fields, especially technical fields, to mobilities and provide the mobility experience to students with special needs. The target groups of the project are students in following fields: Preparatory training,  nursing, media and communication, household and cleaning services, catering, business and administration, vehicle mechanic, . 2- week mobilities will be carried out as group mobilities with accompanying person(s). Accompanying person can provide support during the whole mobility period. Support offered by sending organization is extremely important in order to carry out successful mobilites. \r\nAll students attending to the mobilities have special education needs. Since the students are not chosen yet, we do not know exactly their special needs. However, it is more likely that the student have, for example, mental health problems, delayed development, disorders in language development, attention deficits, visual or hearing impairment or Asperger syndrome or autistic features or a combination of several disorders.

Other mobilities will be carried out by each consortium members. Project will be partly reciprocal as partners in Chech and in Portugal have applied reciprocal mobilities to Keskuspuisto. \r\nMobilties have significant role both personally and professionally for the beneficiaries. Students learn independence, develop social and communication skills, develop language skills and communication in foreign language and experience different cultures. Students improve professional competence when they learn new working methods, new policies and new tools. Students will see different ways of working and studying. Profession will open up in totally different way as the students see how the profession is being taught in other countries. This will improve the motivation of the students.

Previous mobility experiences have provided YA with valuable insights and guidelines. The organization's goal is to both strengthen the competencies and skills through knowledge exchange, international and intercultural experiences. In addition, the aim is also to anchor and further develop the pedagogical program focusing on active learning  through exchange activities. The same applies ECVET routines with arrangements for mobility periods, and focus on learning outcomes and the transparency of the same, The recognition of skills obtained in other countries or contexts is also an important aspect of the project. YA should identify and recognize the knowledge students already have and understand how previous knowledge affects their learning process. ECVET procedures and documentation  have e.g. been applied to ensure that the quality of mobility and recognition of learning outcomes could be tested and implemented. \r\n\r\nWhen the focus changes from teaching to learning and it also affects and alters the role of teachers. The learning will also increasingly be done in other learning environments than in school, such as in workplaces abroad. There is therefore a need to test learning models and tools for such learning, preparations and recognition, in accordance with ECVET. Mobility activities offer an excellent and organized test environment where the teachers develop their role as coaches (mentors/tutors) and student counselors. There is also a growing need to test and gain experience of recognition and validation of knowledge and skills acquired through non-formal and informal learning. Recognition of skills obtained by non-formal and informal learning could offer more flexible learning and study paths.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project is to test and develop:\r\n- Access to on-the-job laring places for students\r\n- Possibility to exchange knowledge for staff\r\n- Recognition of skills obtained by non-formal and informal learning\r\n- Strengthening of key competences\r\n- Strengthening of active and entrepreneurial learning\r\n- Keeping up cooperation with European partners\r\n- Establishment of new contacts\r\n- Emphasizing learning results rather than study time (revised qualification requirements)\r\n- Recognition of prior knowledge and learning in different learning environments\r\n- The introduction of ECVET routines\r\n- The teacher's role as coach (mentor/tutor) and student counselor\r\n\r\nThe skills acquired in another European country will be identified and recognized.  Quality can be guaranteed by ECVET procedures that are followed in all activities.  By describing the expected learning outcomes in a more transparent manner and by supporting an active entrepreneurial learning, YA can promote more flexible pathways for students. Students are actively involved in the preparations of their mobility period, and thus become more aware of the period's expected learning outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe periods are planned according to students' learning needs. The learning outcomes that have been aquired in another context and learning environment will then be identified and recognized by YA. The teachers are supporting the students during their mobility as a couch and mentor.
