The 4 main challenges affecting the sector identified at application phase are being addressed as follows:1.VET education does not match industry needs: The project activities are informed by evidencebased, thorough and market-oriented data. Existing research papers as mentioned in the application were into account together with the project\u2019s research. The methodology used ensures a balanced and market led approach. In addition, the curricula will include a work based learning part that will provide learners with the opportunity to gain relevant skills required by the market/industry.2.Digital shift and technological developments are changing the ways AV & LP works: One of the 3 curricula is specifically dedicated to digital and new technologies, and the research identified the key digital skills needed. The other 2 curricula will also include several online learning sessions that will enhance digital skills of learners.3.Skills Diversification & LLL needs are not fully addressed: curricula materials and resources will be made available through the Creative Common Licence \u00ab badge \u00bb, making them available to a wide variety of professionals within the creative sector and not exclusively for participants of curricula piloting. In addition, a particular attention is given to soft and transversal skills which are relevant to a wide range of professions within the sector.4.AV & LP are not enough entrepreneurial: Entrepreneurial skills are specifically addressed by a dedicated curricula on Cultural Entrepreneurship, which includes modules that tackle creativity, leadership, new business models etc. The curricula aim to give also to more technical professions the skills to build their own business and a sustainable free-lance career in the sector.

However, the use of TEL across European VET providers is patchy and there is a lack of professional practice knowledge in relation to implementing fundamental change in the sector using approaches such as blended-learning.  Blend4VET is a TEL project proposal focusing specifically on how blended-learning approaches can expand learning opportunities while also enhancing existing quality of learning programmes. By implementing and trying out different blended learning approaches project partners will learn from this experiment and take on board the key lessons for their organisations.Project objectives: 1. Explore and document a process the VET provider should follow when moving an existing accredited programme to a blended model and develop a Toolkit to guide other VET providers in designing and implementing blended-learning approaches. 2. Design and implement five blended learning units for different VET con-tent areas as part of existing accredited course for VET learners.  3. Explore what implications blended-learning will have the VET institutions, the role of the VET tutor and learners.  4. Enhance the professional practice knowledge of VET management, principals and teachers in relation to implementing blended-learning through engaging them in a dialogue and professional development activities.  5. Explore how VET providers can work together to develop quality learning resources that can be used across VET programmes.  6. Disseminate project outcomes across EU Member States. The project consortium is comprised of 6 organisations from 5 European countries bringing a wide range of technological and pedagogical knowledge and experience. The project partners are 5 VET organisations (Belfast Metropolitan College from Northern Ireland, City of Dublin ETB from Ireland, Koning Willem 1 College from the Netherlands, Tartu Vocational Education Centre from Estonia and Usurbil Vocational School from Basque Country in Spain) along with an e-Learning services and consultancy organisation, H2 learning from Ireland.

The focus here is on experiencing how this can be done, by capturing the lessons learnt and in engaging with partner organisations to develop innovative solutions to the challenges encountered. The project will explore the change management process involved in implemented a more harmonised approach across VET institutions that will ultimately increase student retention rates, graduation rates and employment opportunities.   The project will develop a number of outcomes:1. \u201cWhat constitutes good Blended Learning in VET?\u201d Module which will aim to prepare VET teachers from partner organisations to develop and design quality learning content that will be delivered in a blended way. 2.

This does not only hold to be true for staff for the city administration but also for the young people who do not only consider themselves citizens of an exciting metropolis but also the beneficiaries of European freedom of movement. Since the middle of the 90s, politicians of the city government and administration have signed European networking agreements in which European cooperation in the field of vocational training is to be enhanced. On the one hand, the cooperation between schools, companies, chambers and labour unions are improved and on the other hand, the acquisition of language and cultural tools  make international cooperation and mobility feasable. TThe main objective is always that the youths should benefit. Through company and VET-or work-oriented stays abroad, they can look beyond their usual limitations. At the same time, reciprocally, Berlin hosts young people in work placements and makes it possible for them to make professional experiences within a guided framework. Sometimes this has also lead to work contracts (both in Berlin and in partner cities).At the same time, the cooperation among the teachers and the decision makers in VET i indispensable. On the one hand, they must understand how to interpret the respective qualifications. On the other hand, they support each other while develooping strategies for improvement of teaching methods and recipes in order to achieve the Lisbon or rahter Maastricht/Copenhagen-Bruges objectives. Social inergration and even inclusion through education and training are as much a topic s the development of ECVET, the application of the EQF in oder to be able to tell companies which receive youths in work placements exactly which competences they can expect from the candidates. Of course there also need to be arrangements for the evaluation and assessment of the learning visits. Often teachers or traininers visit the receiving companies shortly before the end of the stay in order to do the assessemnt together with the local tutor.By all means, Berlin as a member of the city network XARXA FP applies the evaluation forms which were developed according to the development of the certification ISO 9001:2000 (or now 2008). In whole, the Senate Department for Education plans not only to send young persons during their initial vocational training, experts, trainers and teachers, and young professionals in their first year after finishing their vocational training into mobilities, but also to support the vocational schools and the training companies as far as administrative tasks for running an EU-project is concerned. At the same time, they should have all the liberty possible in order to design their strategy for internationalization.Through these mobilities, the cooperation is continually followed up and at the same time, the basis of mutual trust is being reinforced so that partnership projects lead to more MoUs which will make mobilities with an increased qualitiy.By and by the networks thus develop into a \"closely knit fabric\". This is an obvious sign for the fact that Europe is growing together in the field of vocational training and employment. It is worth mentioning that we have event come to a \"second generation of trainees\".

Improved learning environments also support a reduction in the number of early leavers and an increase in VET learners gaining qualifications. VET staff in many EU countries must complete CPD activities but reforms are currently underway to review the activities that can be included and how CPD engagement can be captured. Research shows that informal collaboration with peers can be a productive and supportive opportunity for undertaking lifelong long learning but it often goes unrecognised and unaccredited in VET organisations as there are often no systems in place to support staff in knowing how to set up informal learning activities and then to recognise their engagement with their VET \"pals\".

The project will equip education providers and their staff with innovative methods and tools for basic/employability skills delivery, entrepreneurial spirit and motivation training embedded in the thematic world of design and based on the idea of \"upcycling\", i.e. initiating processes where waste materials or \"useless\" products are converted into new materials or products of better quality or - simply speaking- \"where old products are given more value, not less\" (Thornton Kay, Salvo News 94).\r\nOn a transversal level, the pedagogic outputs of UPDESIGN will also introduce elements of eco-friendliness and environmental sustainability and, by this, raise respective awareness and initiate behavioural changes among their users (e.g. appreciation of material values, waste management etc.). \r\nThe main pedagogic outcomes, the UPDESIGN CURRICULUM, the Teaching and Training HANDBOOK and the TOOLKIT on how to support and motivate young disadvantaged adult learners by employability skills will offer guidelines on the underlying concept for adult and vocational education providers and their staff, as well as hold didactic teaching (and learning) materials to practically use with their final beneficiaries. The products will focus on how to empower young learners in terms of their creativity and entrepreneurial spirit/aptitude, basic skills (reading, writing, product descriptions), ICT skills (internet research, design of magazines, creating texts and pics), organisational and communication skills (reporting, interviewing), financial literacy (purchase of materials, calculations) etc. Pedagogically, the project will follow principles of self-organised and self-directed learning in order to enable learners to gain ownership of their educational and personal pathways.  \r\nTeachers and trainers will be easily able to introduce this learning concept into their educational and counselling activities to make learners benefit. The didacitc material will be collated in the UPDESIGN PLATFORM that will offer Open Education Resource materials for education providers and their staff, as well as learners, free of charge in 5 languages (i.e. English, German, Greek, Italian and Spanish). Users will be able to simply take and implement the material and they can design and upload own OER based on the provided material.\r\nIn the course of the funded lifetime of UPDESIGN, the partnership aims at actively involve at least 240 educators working with at least 180 learners.\r\nUPDESIGN shall improve the quality in adult education and VET systems by offering innovative approaches and contents. The main and first project impact will be that V/ET providers, their teachers, trainers and counsellors will have innovative materials  to empower young adult disadvantaged learners by employability skills via motivational methods and practical tools. They will also be able to multiply the results into other organisations in their countries and beyond.\r\nThe long-term impact envisaged is increased participation in lifelong learning and society of groups otherwise excluded from educational measures and the society, as well as the improvement of their employability. Furthermore, the fact that, in this way, materials will be used for upcycling processes will help to save energy, money and gain new products.\r\nThe project shall have a positive impact at VET systems and programmes on local, regional, national level in the partner countries, as well as on a wider European level.", "http://www.springboard-opps.org", "Springboard Opportunities Limited", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA204-000085_coordinator"], [2015, "JUVENTUD Y MOVILIDAD", "Springboard Opportunities Limited", 20290.0, 5, 10, "CONTEXT :\r\nThis project is part of the Erasmus + program, Key Action 1 : Learning Mobility of Individuals ( KA1 ) The application deadline is 4 February 2015.The project will have a total duration of 24 months starting in May 2015.\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS :\r\nThe project will involve a total of 4 volunteers aged between 17 and 30 years ( men and women ) .

All of this will increase the chances of finding a job and raise their levels of employability, which is the main objective of this project. The group objective of \u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N III\u201d consists of a total of 25 young between 18 and 35 years old, in possession of a VET certificate, obtained in any of the institutions that make up the Consortium.The professional areas which the project addresses are:- Physical and sports activities- Agrarian - Administration and management - Graphic arts- Trade and marketing - Electricity and electronics - Hospitality and tourism- Information technology and communications - Installation and maintenance - Personal image - Sound and vision - Wood, furniture and cork - Health- Sociocultural and community services - Transport and vehicle maintenanceNeeds and problems of young students and/or graduates from Cuenca in these sectors are broadly:- A high rate of youth unemployment. - Little or no work experience. - Limited knowledge and use of a second language. - Low level of self-employment in the province of Cuenca. - A high concentration of the population in rural areas. - Very limited labour supply in the province due to lack of a solid business network. - Academic offer very limited. - Loss of human capital for young graduates who have to emigrate to work in jobs related to their training. - Lack of knowledge and use of ICT.- Little awareness of European citizenship and the workforce to compete in a global market.Based on the socio-economic context, the identified needs, the professional sectors and the overall project objective, we have established the following specific objectives:- Improve the employability of participants through quality labor practices in companies abroad.- Provide the tools to adapt to a new work environment in a different culture and learn other methods of work in a foreign company.- Develop skills in a second language.- Acquire job skills learning to create supportive alliances in a very different socio-cultural framework, working with people from other cultures.- Promote equal opportunities for young people in rural and urban areas, and between men and women.- Acquire social skills and develop personal skills by learning to organize and structure work routines.- Provide career guidance to participants.The relevance of the project is enhanced by the fact that it operates on a rural, depressed territory with scarce resources, providing greater opportunities for participants to complete their qualifications and find employment.\u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N III\u201d provides 25 selected participants, according to a public and transparent procedure, the organization of stays for completing professional training in European companies for 3 months in Padova (Italy), Lisbon (Portugal), Belfast (Northern Ireland) and Prague (Czech Republic). In each of these cities, the Consortium has the support of a set of intermediaries and host companies that consolidate the quality of the project partners, with which they are collaborating for years.At a cultural and social level, apprenticeships offer young people of Cuenca the opportunity to live an enriching experience that will take place in a cultural context characterized by diversity, with new forms of work and resolving conflicts, which contribute to having a broader vision and social skills increasingly valued by companies.In short, \u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N III\u201d is the result of the commitment of the Consortium and its partners in continuing the promotion of training and employment for local young people.

In this context, the local young population presents a number of pressing needs related to lack of experience and job opportunities that justify the existence of the \"ALCORC\u00d3N EN EUROPA\" whose main objective is to promote the employability of young people of Alcorc\u00f3n immediate environment by improving their opportunities for personal development and employability levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ALCORC\u00d3N EN EUROPA\" is sponsored by a consortium coordinated by the Municipal Institute for Employment and Economic Development of Alcorc\u00f3n (IMEPE) and comprised of three others active in the field of education institutions, training and employment (EMPESA, Centro de Formaci\u00f3n M\u00f3stoles y Ondas Escolares y Universitarias), who together have extensive experience in mobility projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, the \"ALCORC\u00d3N EN EUROPA\" project is aimed at a group of 30 young people from Alcorc\u00f3n between the ages of 18 and 35 years old and its environment, pursuing or already in possession of a professional certificate through a VET course, obtained in any of the centers that make up the Consortium, and preferably don\u2019t have previous work experience in their professional or academic field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sectors and professional sectors to which the project is concerned with correspond to the certified professional offered by the Consortium members are specifically:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Physical and sports activities. \r\n\r\n- Administration and management. \r\n\r\n- Graphic arts. \r\n\r\n- Trade and marketing. \r\n\r\n- Electricity and electronics. \r\n\r\n- Energy and water. \r\n\r\n- Hospitality and tourism. \r\n\r\n- Sound and vision. \r\n\r\n- Information technology and communications. \r\n\r\n- Health. \r\n\r\n- Safety and environment. \r\n\r\n- Sociocultural and community services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Consortium has identified the specific needs of young graduates in these professions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Poor knowledge of a second language, which prevents them from dealing with the demands of the labour market.\r\n\r\n- Lack of experience or training in their field, making it impossible for young people to be competitive when applying for a job. \r\n\r\n- Lack of expertise (due to the aforementioned lack of experience). \r\n\r\n- Requirement for continuous adapting to new technologies (ICT).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the socio-economic context, to identified needs, professional sectors and the overall project objective, we have established the following objectives for \"ALCORC\u00d3N EN EUROPA\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Encourage actions which look to acquire quality training and effective and specialized practice. \r\n\r\n- To combat the lack of connection between the worlds of business and education, and their respective needs, building bridges and synergies. \r\n\r\n- Provide participants with an opportunity to improve a second language with a stay abroad. \r\n\r\n- To develop the participants' ability to entrepreneurship, to create more autonomous and sustainable societies. \r\n\r\n- Raise awareness among young people of the opportunities offered by new employment, which requires urgent demand for trained and skilled professionals. \r\n\r\n- Raising public awareness of the importance of international action to levels that contribute to local economic development and understanding of the new realities and cultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ALCORC\u00d3N EN EUROPA\" plans stays for 30 young people, selected in accordance to a public and transparent process, to complete quality practical training in European companies for 3 months in Florence (Italy), Lisbon (Portugal), Belfast (United Kingdom), Krakow (Poland) and Prague (Czech Republic).

In the meantime, work on a tender for an in depth skills analysis and training needs  which will feed into a long term training needs analysis commenced.\r\n\r\n(3) Disseminating information about Transnational Mobility: The PA issued a call for an expression of interest amongst employees for ERASMUS placements on 14th June 2016. Staff were requested to indicate their interest in participating in such projects and their training needs. This exercise clearly indicated that there is high interest amongst PA employees in undergoing ERAMSUS Placements.  This call was complemented by an information seminar held on 21st June 2016. During the seminar information about mobility activities was provided by the Erasmsus+ Core Group to PA staff, including details of preparatory and follow up work and the undertaking of a work placement with an emphasis on training needs assessment and the setting up of a tailor made work programme. An important aspect of such seminar was testimonials from PA staff that had already experienced such transnational mobility placements, highlighting the benefits of such placements.  The Erasmsus+ Core Group also indicated all the support that it will be providing during the work placements. The Authority will be preparing a checklist covering all aspects that need to be prepared from the participants side, so as to guide the participants about all the requirements. \r\n\r\n(4) Carrying out the Work Placements: Following the identification of the key areas where placements are a priority, discussions with the relevant managers will follow up to devise work programmes which are structurally embedded and linked to the training needs of its staff and its operational objectives. A call will be issued internally within the Authority.  A panel will be set up to carry out interviews  and once participants are identified following the procedure above, the Erasmsus+ Core Group will match the placements with the chosen candidates and then start working on a detailed and tailor-made work programme together with the host, the participant and the respective Line Manager. \r\n\r\n(5) Dissemination of Knowledge Obtained: In 2016 two placements were carried out and the knowledge obtained was disseminated. It is planned that this dissemination will also take place following the placements which will take place in 2017.  In the meantime a press release was issued to disseminate information about these placements externally.\r\n\r\n(6) Post mobility Follow up: Post mobility follow up will be held through one to one sessions with the participants to to gather initial feedback on the overall experience and to assess and validate that the knowledge, skills and competences identified in the beginning of the process have been acquired. In addition, an assessment of both the informal and non-formal learning will take place, including the identification of learning outcomes which were not originally planned but still achieved during the mobility projects. \r\n\r\nFor the upcoming placements, a status report was referred to PA Management outlining the hosts identified and the interest expressed by PA staff, together with the identified training needs and suggestions for the 2017 placements. PA Management agreed with the proposed 2017 placements and committed in topping up funds as may be required. It is planned to have 10 placements in 2017 instead of the 5 planned in the strategy, in view of the increase in potential hosts and the interest amongst PA employees.  The main objective of these placements is to strengthen the skills of staff working on Mapping, Land Surveying, Strategic Planning and International Funding. With respect to mapping and landsurveying, focus is required on the areas of Photogrammetry and Data capture. On Strategic Planning, staff requires more exposure on the development of planning policies and plans, including maritime spatial planning. In addition, the staff working on international funding requires hands on experience on the development of EU Funded Projects. Work programmes will be devised to take into account these strategic needs.", "http://www.finance-ni.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-MT01-KA116-026892_5"]]}}, "4GB": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Industry 4.0 for wood and furniture manufacturers", "ION TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED", 951091.0, 5, 13, "The furniture and woodworking sectors can benefit from the advantages that Industry 4.0 brings.

This possibility began with training in Customer Service before we extended this first to include Administration  and later Commerce, before our 4th project in Commerce, oriented towards the English-speaking and today those who speak Spanish.\r\nIn the interval, when a teacher involved in Erasmus+ projects has left our School, the recruitment of a replacement has always been the opportunity for the staff to renew its commitment to this aspect of school-life, and for 2016/17 a Business/Commerce teacher has integrated the staff and will be accredited to teach the two disciplines in both French and English.\r\nWe have found this Erasmus+ experience particularly rewarding for pupils: it develops self-reliance, the students are more confident, and as a result they become more open to others: their environment is spontaneous, and they are constantly solicited. In today's disturbed national & international contexts which favour division and where students \"find their marks\" only with difficulty, activities in relation to Erasmus+ have taken on real meaning, given that knowledge of others leads to understanding. In the present case, prejudices are abandoned in this period of apprenticeship, which has a regulating effect on inequality and fraternity.\r\nWe are well aware of our students' need for a better understanding of the Europeans around them, and also the growing importance of professional opportunities for young people in this part of the world.\r\nSo the aims of those participating are on the one hand to improve their language skills and the ability to relate to others, and on the other hand to be open to other ways of life so as to be able to absorb cultures that are different from their own.\r\nMost of our young people come from differing, mainly modest sociocultural backgrounds, and the majority have had a fragile education by the time they join our High School; this translates into students who have incomplete apprenticeships and a lack of confidence in themselves.\r\nIn the academic year 2016/17, 13 students in their second year of study for their professional diploma \"Bac Pro ARCU / GA\" will profit from the Erasmus+ experience in Belfast, while 4 students taking our \"Bac Pro Commerce\" course will be staying in Seville for 4 weeks in March. These visits follow immersion periods in English and Spanish conducted by an outside training organisation, and in which they can prepare this important stay.\r\nAs in previous years, a partner in the corresponding country is chosen; the partner's local knowledge ideally allows us to list appropriate companies and families that correspond to the participants' profiles.\r\nAccording to our terms of reference, participants' visits include: accommodation in a host family ; work-experience lasting four weeks in a business (one student per department or business depending on the size of the company); and planned cultural visits.\r\nAt the end of their stay, students (and their foreign tutors) receive questionnaires to complete, and each Erasmus+ project is the subject of a written review from our partners which highlights the strong points and notes those which need improvement. Remarks made by the National Agency in their report are carefully analysed, and the whole is representative of the systematic reflexion given to projects before we modify, adjust and develop future ones.\r\nFor our students, this experience goes beyond simply crossing borders: it is a real challenge to be met, and our students take pride in this. The confidence they have acquired is reinvested in a growth phase that leads to success (often in the form of further, postgraduate education), giving value to their professional studies in high school and resulting in recognition by their peers. It is an experience that allows these students to count on a \"Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel\" diploma with European honours, namely EUROPRO and EUROPASS, two distinctions that are also synonymous with quality in the eyes of the businesses that they join later.\r\nErasmus+ project experience continues to prove that this is an undeniable bridge from professional to higher education due to the fact that the confidence acquired by these young people opens perspectives of a future that they thought to be out of reach. It also testifies to their adaptability when faced with the requirements of the world of employment.\r\nToday the St. Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise school is recognized for the seriousness of its commitments to European projects. This is a strongpoint that will be highlighted on our website, particularly on Open Days and in forums dealing with career opportunities. \r\nBoth of the latter add value to the notion of professional education as a means to success.\r\nOur students are the best ambassadors of this experience.", "http://Www.acrossborderssudy.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036058_1"], [2016, "Sortir de nos fronti\u00e8res, s'ouvrir \u00e0 d'autres cultures, s'appuyer sur nos racines communes.", "Across borders study", 17144.0, 3, 5, "Our professional high school has been involved in the Erasmus + projects for more than ten years, and it is with great conviction, reinforced every year, that we bring our students to collectively live the work experience that was never proposed to them during their previous experience.Since 2001, our pupils of tertiary vocational training have had the chance to benefit from a professional practice thanks to the Leonardo and Erasmus + programs in various English-speaking countries or regions of the European Community: Ireland, England, Wales, and in Spain as to the Spanish-speaking countries (a new destination in 2015-2016), and this in compliance with our European Sections.All these experiences are particularly enriching for students because they help them to grow, and that is the reason why they straighten and reinforce our motivation to apply, year after year, for the Erasmus + . Indeed, we are aware of the increasing importance of a professional integration of young people within the European Community.Moreover, the personal fulfillment they enjoy in the aftermath of their experience remains the most visible impact, especially when they come back later as grown-ups to tell us their professional lives (links are maintained with some former pupils).Thus, after each experience abroad, our teaching staff systematically seeks to know precisely the opinions and impressions of our pupils, and we also ask them to share their experiences.Through the questionnaires which are handed to the pupils as well as to the foreign tutors, we are able to correct, improve and develop our future mobilities.In the same way, we make sure to take into account the remarks of the assessors of the National Agency, as mentioned in their report at the time when the grants are allocated.Our will to widen the offer of training has led us to open the European Section \u2013 \u201cEnglish\u201d \u2013 to the Administrative Management training in 2014, and then to apply for a European Section \u2013 \u201cSpanish\u201d \u2013 which has been accepted in our Trade training for the school year 2016. Expanding the mobility to Spain is consistent with our outlook.In 2015-2016, fifteen year 12 pupils of the Reception and Customer Relations training and the Administrative Management training were able to benefit from a four-week mobility (in March-April 2015) in Belfast, Northern Ireland. This year (2015 -2016), sixteen students of these two classes are going to Belfast again and seven year 12 students of the Trade training will be discovering Seville over the same period (four weeks in January-February 2016). These two mobilities are preceded by an immersion course in English or Spanish for a significant amount of time within a training organization outside the school in order to de-stress the students and prepare them for their stay abroad.As in our previous mobility, an intermediate partner in the host country is chosen (after a reconnaissance trip if it\u2019s a new partner): the latter facilitates the database for possible companies to employ our candidates and for families to host them in line with their profile.Our participants coming from varied and mainly modest socio-cultural backgrounds, we observed that the European mobility through the Erasmus + program establishes, for these pupils whose school experience is fragile, a real added value: concrete, recognized and source of appreciation.As regards the main objectives for our participants, they will be as followed:- To improve their language and communicational skills as well as their linguistic experiences in a working environment as in everyday life and/or family life.- To embrace other lifestyles and become integrated into a different culture.We have the ambition to think that this mobility allows them to cross the borders of the national systems and to thrive in ways of lives which are not familiar to them; that is why we encourage the largest number to participate in this project and put into practice their know-how, as well as their manners, abroad.By this way, they will also be able to qualify for the European Mention as well as EUROPRO and EUROPASS.These two diplomas soon become assets for our participants but also for their future employers. Similarly, these experiences abroad proved in the past that they were an undeniable springboard between high school and higher education, so much so as the acquired self-confidence opens to unexplored perspectives, or which were not previously envisioned.Finally, this project will also facilitate the adaptation to the requirements of the working world, what makes of this experience an exceptional asset.Our objectives aim to be, above all, realistic and operational, always in adequacy with the expectations and skills of our various partners.Our high school is now recognized for the sustainability of the European projects and we never fail to promote our mobilities and to mention their successes, knowing that our students are the best ambassadors to represent them!", "http://Www.acrossborderssudy.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-023057_2"]]}}, "6AS": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Youth Work - Music and Cultural Entrepreneurship", "YouthAction Northern Ireland", 104678.0, 4, 7, "The aim of this project is to identify, design and test a best practice approach to engage and retain young people aged 16 to 25 in youth services using music as a medium.

The project\u2019s aim is to deepen the participants\u2019 knowledge on social entrepreneurship and provide them with the expertise needed for working out a detailed business plan for a social project of their choice. The Youth Exchange's main aim is to increase the participant's courage to try and develop a social business, provide the basic necessary skills to do that, and further motivate the participants to keep on working on improving society as well as their proficiencies in that particular field of work. The Youth Banks were selected as a realiable partner with long-term youth work experience that will ensure that the participants are chosen well and are well prepared, and the partner organizations will also benefit from the exchange thanks to the new skills, knowledge and attitudes their members and other participants will develop during the project.  \r\n\r\nThe total number of participants in this project is 35.

The nature of the project from the outset is to provide our pupils with something different that is based on the STEAM subjects' curriculum but goes further than the traditional school curriculum. The Drones/robotics Club is a new venture for the Romanian school and for the boys of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. Both schools will be relying on this ERASMUS plus partnership for guidance, expertise and coaching of the pupils enthusiasm in this area. Crucially this extra- curricular activity fosters the very problem-solving skills that are required in industry, both locally and globally. The Club is a very practical way of remedying the need to prepare our students earlier and better for employment in the STEAM/ MINT based industries of Engineering and ICT. This is not only relevant to St Dominic\u2019s, the all-girls school, who are committed to promoting such university courses and jobs among girls. It is the common desire to all four schools to make students  better understand environmental issues like damage and subsequently use modern drones technology to monitor the scientific observations and arrive at solutions. Phase Two of the project focuses on the exchange of drones creations and creative ideas. It goes without saying that the modern era is a global era, where one\u2019s success lies in the ability to adapt to, understand and empathize with another culture.

Furthermore, the Northern Ireland schools are coming from two very different religious, political and gender based  divisions. Ultimately, all the participants hope that it will be possible to shape European citizens that will in turn use their skills to better serve their future place of employment, society and country. The final summit-style conference in Munich in year three will allow  students to put their newly-acquired international diplomacy skills to the test, when the findings about environmental damages will be presented and the attempts at solutions will be discussed by  a panel of young scientifically fit Europeans from Romania, Northern Ireland (Great Britain) and Germany.\r\nA project of this scale cannot happen without the genuine commitment of the staff involved.

We aim to give young people a chance to develop themselves, to get to know other cultures and become aware of their ability to make a change. Secondly, we want to contribute to the environment, which exceeds national borders and as such creates the need (and opportunity!) to come together. Participants will join an intense program in which we combine intercultural learning activities with sail training and research, prevention and reduction of plastic pollution. \r\n\r\nDuring a 21 day Youth Exchange with 38 youngsters, we will explore, research and clean-up the Swedish coast, from G\u00f6tenborg to Stockholm, with sail training ship Vega Gamleby as our base. The ship enables us to offer the participants a strong experiential learning program, visit multiple places and spend time out on sea learning to sail and doing research in between. Staying on the Vega means living and working in close quarters, experiencing cultural/background differences 24/7. Participants will be able to discover and develop their talents and cross their personal boundaries, with activities they will organise with help from mentors. These are linked to the theme of environmental awareness/plastic pollution and directed towards the discovery of each other\u2019s cultures, gaining new skills and attitudes and learning to work together with people from other cultures and backgrounds. Sailing the Vega is a means to this end. Both the mentors as well as the professional crew of the Vega will practice working methods based on the principles of experiential learning. This means there will be a lot of room for participants to make mistakes (to learn from) and for reflection on personal choices, actions and values. Besides the sail training (which is a renowned outdoor learning activity that inspires personal development, self-confidence and social-awareness), research and intercultural learning activities, we will also actively interact with the local community in places we visit. Together, we will make an impact on the environment, by cleaning up coastal areas and hopefully inspiring them to keep up this good work afterwards. \r\n\r\nParticipants come from 6 different European countries (SV, DK, NL, FR, UK and NO) and diverse backgrounds. We will make a special effort to include participants that are facing (financial, medical, geographical) obstacle in their daily live. The  wide variety of tasks in our program (from setting sails and doing dishes to documenting samples and talking to locals), means there is something to do for everybody, regardless of their abilities: everybody will contribute to the end result and will thus be included. Participants do not have to have experience in sailing or research, since the professional crew and researcher onboard will teach us all we need to know.\r\n\r\nTo meet the environmental objective of this project, we have joined forces with By The Ocean We Unite, a Dutch foundation concerned with plastic pollution. They will provide us with the knowledge and expertise to significantly contribute to the scientific research and creating awarenes of this matter, in the form of support before the Exchange and sending a marine biologist/researcher with us on board. \r\n\r\nAll organisations in this application benefit from the project, gaining international experience, expanding their networks and being able to offer their members a great experience. There will also be a local/regional effect, in the form of participants impacting their peers, family and school/youthclubs etc. They will inspire them to perhaps look for similar opportunities and/or become aware of the need for change with regards to plastic pollution. Our focus however, is the development of the youngsters and the biggest impact of our project is to be found in the long lasting and self-expanding impact that participating in this Exchange will have on them. We aim to create a learning experience which will make the youngsters go home having discovered talents and strengths they were not aware of, resulting in the realization that they are capable of more than they thought they were. Bonus effect of the environmental objective is the fact that it will make them aware of how easy it is to personally make a change. This will benefit them for years to come. They will bring their improved self-esteem, greater awareness for cultural differences/environmental issues and developed competences into the rest of their career and (personal)life. Having learned what they will learn will open doors for them, to schools, companies, organizations or (local) government branches, where they will impact not only the people around them, but also on the institution itself.

The exchange will take place on board of sea going sailing vessel the Gulden Leeuw, sailing from Lisbon (Portugal)to A Coruna (Spain) and will finish in Cherbourg (France). The focus will be on the following topics:-EU Citizenship, EU awareness and Democracy-Intercultural/intergenerational education and (lifelong)learning-Inclusion/equity  By learning to sail the vessel together  and being responsible for each other\u2019s safety and wellbeing on board, the participants will not only talk about cultural differences, but also experience them 24/7. This takes the intercultural learning to another level and learning to sail the vessel is as such, merely a means to that end. The topic of inclusion is covered by the fact that more than half of the participants is facing obstacles in their daily lives, financially, medically or geographically. On board everybody is equally important: we simply need everyone to sail the vessel. This means we have to make sure everybody finds a way to contribute, which will also teach participants to respect each other.EU awareness , citizenship and democracy is found in everyday life on board, where participants are part of a mini society where informal rules will be created and adjusted. A day-to-day program of  intercultural activities adds an extra component to this and consists of diverse activities, varying from discussions about Europe and the challenges it faces (like racism, refugees etc.), country presentations and interaction with local people.  The Gulden Leeuw works with the Sail Training Program, which requires participants to confront many demanding challenges, physical and emotional. It inspires self-confidence and the acceptance of personal responsibility.  It promotes an acceptance of others whatever their social or cultural backgrounds, and develops a willingness to take controlled risks.  It uses the experience of being at sea principally as a means to help people learn about themselves, discover hidden strengths and talents and understand the value of working as a team. Each participant experiences a leaderships role, having to create teamwork and taking initiative. A participant may, for example, after a few days, be put in charge of hoisting a single sail, and by the end of the program, be in charge of a section of the deck when making a complicated manoeuvre.  The participants will end up sailing the vessel themselves, the crew only guarding the safety at all times. All ingredients for an excellent lifelong learning experience!  The program of intercultural learning activities will be run by the participants themselves. Mentors are there for help and advice, and will, for example, appoint small groups of participants to be in charge of an activity. This way, and by letting the participants be  actively involved in the preparations leading up to the Exchange, the participants will get ownership of their own learning experience. Generally speaking is our working method strongly based on the principles of experiential learning. We feel like that to really learn and understand things, from sailing the ship to getting insight in other cultures, we need to experience something, reflect on it, come up with an idea, try something else/new and experience it again. Participants will improve their team working skills and  become more aware of their abilities, strengths and weaknesses, both physically, mentally and linguistically. Their self-confidence will increase and their socials skills improve. Due to the culturally diverse environment on board, participants will grow awareness for cultural differences and similarities, and understanding for differences in values and norms. This effect together with the impact the participants will have back home on their sending organization, school and family, makes this project not only a life-changing experience for the partaking youngsters, but means it also has the potential to have a very long lasting effect. The participants their experience is will not only influence their own lives, but will also inspire others to look beyond their everyday world into the rest of the world.
