We are a co-located unit within the host mainstream, Toryglen Primary School, with specialist provision for pupils with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Currently, the only opportunity for modern language learning in our establishment is through inclusion within the mainstream host school. Because of our pupils' difficulties with social communication and interaction, it is not possible for all of them to access the modern languages curriculum within the mainstream setting. Currently, one member of our staff is undergoing Spanish training through the Modern Languages in the Primary School (MLPS) programme. By attending a week-long immersion course in Spain, this member of staff will consolidate learning from the MLPS course while improving competence and confidence to teach the Spanish language. Our delegate will also improve methodological expertise in the teaching of Spanish and develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary Spain. The course will also provide materials and ideas suitable for teaching Spanish at the primary level including the use of ICT. The course will also provide an opportunity for our delegate to network, share good practice and develop projects with primary colleagues. \r\nOn return, our staff member will be more linguistically confident and culturally aware allowing us to develop and deliver a modern languages policy and curriculum suitable for the needs of our pupils. Initially, this staff member will be responsible for the planning and delivery of the modern languages curriculum and will implement a programme of work for Primary 5-7. Following on from this, training will be delivered to other members of staff which will allow us to work collegiately to develop the Primary 1-7 modern languages curriculum appropriate to the needs of our pupils. This project will allow us to forge stronger links with our host mainstream school and through staff training and development, this opens the possibility of each establishment now being able to offer two modern languages to their pupils. \r\nIt is envisaged that the modern languages curriculum will be embedded in our school improvement plan and that our school will make links with other establishments locally, nationally and internationally through eTwinning.

MBK is a vocational college for Health and Social Care in Unna, the Ruhr area of Germany. Glasgow and Unna are both regions with a background of working class families, high levels of unemployment and poor health statistics. The topic of health is relevant to both student groups, it is part of the improvement plans of both organisations and is prioritised in international and local educational policies. It offers a rich base for meaningful language and cross cultural learning as it forms part of our students' everyday life experiences.Our PROJECT OBJECTIVES are:- to equip our students with improved skills and knowledge that will lead to a healthy lifestyle beyond school and across countries;- to raise awareness and create a better understanding of different culturally influenced health habits- to enable our students to take a greater responsibility for their own health and wellbeing;- to enable positive relationships between students that will let them see the value this can add to their social wellbeing;- to increase foreign language skills and enable our students to be better prepared for the European job market;NUMBER AND PROFILES OF PARTICIPANTS:20 students - 10 from each school - will be involved in all  aspects of the project including all mobilities. The overall number of participants taking part in the various activities planned for the duration of the project, however, will be higher as the project targets the whole school communities of both organisations. During mobilities, partners from the local community and other organisations will be involved too. The 10 students from Hollybrook School are between 16-17 years old, and all have additional learning and support needs with some of them being on the Autistic Spectrum. For the majority of the students, taking part in a mobility during this project will be their first time they travel abroad. The 10 participants from MBK are between 17-19 years old. A high number of the students are looking to pursue a profession in the care sector with a focus on disability support work when they leave college.DESPCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES:Both student groups will establish initial contact per email exchange to learn about common interests. They will also be carrying out research on health statistics and traditions in each country as part of their language learning and language preparation. During their first mobility the students will then jointly discuss and develop a questionnaire with the help of which they carry out a survey at their own schools to achieve an analysis of the health and lifestyle habits of their school communities. The results will be evaluated by the group and shared with the wider and local communities of each school. During the second mobility, the project group will focus on addressing the findings of the health surveys and start taking action together by planning and preparing healthy meals and  taking part in health and wellbeing activities together. The activities during the final two mobilities will focus on peer and team work. The students, operating as peer leaders, will organise, prepare and deliver a range of workshops to their school communities, parents and participants from the wider local community.METHODOLOGY:Our project has a strong focus on peer learning and co-operative learning. All types of peer learning activities during our mobilities aim to boost motivation, confidence and a deeper cross cultural understanding. RESULTS AND IMPACT:For both schools, we expect to see:- our students to be more knowledgeable about individual, socially and culturally influenced health habits. - our students to mature into role models and become an inspiration to fellow students and future generations- a sustainable relationship and long lasting relationships between our organisations and its participants- a sustainable change in lifestyles and attitudes towards health and wellbeing among our students and the school community- an increased motivation among our students to learn foreign languages- an improvement of our students' foreign language skills- higher attainment in the English and German departments At MBK specifically, we expect to see increased skills when working with students with additional learning and support needs which will have a direct impact on improving students employablilty skills when looking for work in the care sector.", "http://www.hollybrook-sec.glasgow.sch.uk", "Hollybrook School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024230_coordinator"]]}}, "7NH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "European Connections", "Holy Cross Primary", 11154.0, 2, 2, "Our school has maintained contact and has worked with schools in Europe through the British Council Connecting Classrooms and subsequent relationships established from this programme.

This will enable coaches to achieve their full potential. More importantly, it means the standard of football played by their students will inevitably improve. This current project will address key Eramus+ priorities by targeting and upskilling FAI Coach Educators who will make maximum benefit from inclusion on the mobility. The future development of football in this country is reliant on better coaches. At all levels of the game we need coaches who possess the expertise, knowledge and attitude to positively affect the players and teams with which they work.\r\n\r\nA key objective for participants is that they will benefit from up-skilling and improved career progression opportunities and so the FAI will track participants' employment history for a period of three years updated annually, following the mobility in order to establish key data and trends regarding the direct correlation between a successful European mobility and improved employability. In addition FAI International teams performance at men's, women's and disability senior level will similarly be measured annually for a period of 3 years following the mobility. \r\n\r\nThe Project Manager, Greig Paterson, will be key to the evaluation process.

Mobility will enhance personal and professional skills via exposure to innovative Spanish coaching practices which have been proven to enhance player performance and development. \r\n\r\nFootball coaches working within the Scottish Professional Football League clubs work within a competitive, results-driven labour market with unemployment rates above the national average; 29% of coaches are unemployed at any given moment. Surveys of employers have shown that skills levels for many Scottish coaches now fail to meet current expectations. This has resulted in many positions being filled by more skilled coaches from outwith the UK. This project will allow our VET coaching staff to undertake mobility to Spain which will allow them to acquire state-of-the-art, innovative skills which will increase the quality of our club coaching.\r\n\r\nOur Spanish host partner has been involved as a host partner in more or more of the Lifelong Learning Programme strands and have an established track record of excellence in relation to hosting and integrating participants within the work place. Queen\u2019s Park FC has previously sent IVT and VETPRO participants to Olivanova over the past three years and we have experienced, at first hand, their strong commitment to European co-operation. Olivanova was also selected on the basis of them being an internationally recognised Centre of Excellence and their natural fit with the project objectives.\r\n\r\nSpanish clubs in the Valencia region are world leaders in the development of young male and female players through their early identification in the grassroots leagues and progression through the club academy structures into full-time professional status. The strong emphasis on community involvement has been shown to enhance player retention rates and development profiles for both male and female players. The Spanish clubs were selected on the basis of innovative coaching methods that enhance player performance and development, community network innovations and enhanced coaching competences that would be provided to the Queen\u2019s Park mobility participants.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives are summarised below:\r\n1. To introduce participants to the coaching qualifications ladder, providing them with a career path and a recognised beginners coaching qualification to keep them in the game and to offer them employability within sport for the future. Often coaches come from socially deprived areas and have limited interest in academic education and so this European mobility would upskill them, providing bespoke vocational education and training in an area of particular interest to them.\r\n2. Become role models for other participants at Queen\u2019s Park FC, bringing back new ideas and enthusiasm to support grassroots football at the community based club, benefiting from the health and wellbeing aspect of participation in sport.\r\n3. To have a long lasting effect on participants. This mobility may very well be the first time a number of participants have travelled abroad and introducing them to good coaching practices within Europe would significantly enhance their learning experience.\r\n4. To broaden social development of participants through interaction by meeting new people. The mobility will improve personal development and social awareness for participants. Interpersonal skills will be developed through group discussion, debate and presentations.\r\n5. To enhance employability resulting from the mobility after which the participants will either complete a beginners coaching qualification recognised by the Scottish FA or gain recognition towards revalidation of their current coaching qualification.\r\n6. To enhance the employability of participants through the acquisition of additional skills and qualifications as a direct result of mobility.\r\n7. To enhance security of tenure and improve career progression for participants.\r\n8. To monitor future employment rates among participants.\r\n\r\nThe longer term impact of the project will be assessed by following up participants further on in their career at three and five years after mobility and the data compared with peers who have not undertaken mobility.", "http://www.queensparkfc.co.uk", "The Queen's Park Football Club Limited", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012813_coordinator"]]}}, "9DE": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "A European Effective Practice Model and Impact Measurement Tool for sport-inspired social inclusion programmes", "THE SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE TRUST", 403146.0, 6, 7, "The Football League Trust and its consortium partners each deliver a range of activities in their respective countries which aim to use the \u201cPower of Football\u201d to positively impact the issues that impact on social inclusion.An extensive Context and Policy Review in each of the partner territories to determine how sport currently impacts local, regional and national policy in a range of social policy domains highlighted the fact that, although there is significant empirical and anecdotal evidence that sport can have a positive impact on a range of social problems, there is very little definitive evidence, and certainly no attempt to share learnings or data across European boundaries.Although the monitoring and evaluation activities carried out by the respective consortium partners indicate that existing programmes have a positive impact on a range of social problems, the organisations currently operate in isolation, with virtually no international cooperation or sharing of best practice to identify the programmes/activities that have the most impact. Furthermore, there is currently no mechanism for organisations delivering sport-based social inclusion activities to measure, or place a value, on these activities.There is therefore a distinct need for a best practice model which draws on the experience of organisations that are addressing the issues relating to social inclusion via sport, to create a consistent and measurable set of resources which can be used by practitioners across Europe to deliver targeted and cost effective outcomes in the key areas that impact on social inclusion.To address this need, this project will develop Online Resources and an Impact Measurement Tool for the delivery of social inclusion programmes across Europe.
