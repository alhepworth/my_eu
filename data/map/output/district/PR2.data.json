The fulminant course of NSTIs (in the order of hours) demands immediate diagnosis and adequate interventions in order to salvage lives and limbs. However, diagnosis and management are difficult due to heterogeneity in clinical presentation, in co-morbidities and in microbiological aetiology. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in order to improve outcome of NSTIs. To achieve this, a comprehensive and integrated knowledge of diagnostic features, causative microbial agent, treatment strategies, and pathogenic mechanisms (host and bacterial disease traits and their underlying interaction network) is required. INFECT is designed to obtain such insights through an integrated systems biology approach in patients and different clinically relevant experimental models.\n\nSpecific objectives of INFECT are to:\n1. Unravel specific mechanisms underlying diseases signatures though a bottom-up systems approach applied to clinically relevant experimental settings\n2. Apply a top-down systems biology approach to NSTI patient samples to pin-point key host and pathogen factors involved in the onset and development of infection\n3.

Crucially, each year 60% (390) of ASE graduates DO NOT receive a professional contract upon immediate completion of the programme. Of the 40% (260) that get a contract immediately only HALF (130), will secure a second contract the following year. This means that each year 520 young players (18/19 years old) are removed from the game, many of whom will have been striving to achieve a career in it since the age of 8. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlongside this there continues to be a large inward migration of players to the UK from Europe and coupled with mediocre national level performances/results there is strong evidence indicating that young home grown players are underdeveloped and overlooked for older more experienced overseas players. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contextual observations and evidence above highlight a number of structural issues in the game as a whole but specifically call for a need to change and improve at the youth/developmental level. Some of these structural issues are being addressed by the recent creation and introduction (2013/14 season) of the Elite Player Performance Plan. This is the new blueprint for football development and within it's array of stipulations around how to successfully resource and implement a philosophy of football development, it specifically recognises exposure to football within Europe as an intrinsic aid to that development process. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITY 1 (aimed at apprentices currently undertaking ASE)  has the following participant level objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. To achieve both quantitative and qualitative improvements in the development of the participants as footballers \r\n\r\n2. To improve the knowledge and understanding of Lifelong Learning principles within Apprentices \r\n\r\n3. To improve the knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in football and other careers \r\n\r\n4. To deliver a high quality social and cultural programme including exposure to the language within the host country \r\n\r\n5. To ascertain if participants are more willing to travel to Europe to take advantage of the opportunities as a result of the trip \r\n\r\n6. To achieve migration from England/Wales to Europe as a footballer and/or in alternative career paths in August 2015 and beyond \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to address these aims and provide added value to the participants across these aims, LFE will deliver a two week pre-season training programme in The Netherlands for four Football League under 18 Academy teams. This will mean that 96 participants will benefit. This will be facilitated by four Eredivisie (top tier) host clubs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nACTIVITY 2 (aimed at RELEASED apprentices who are recent graduates from ASE) has very similar particpant aims as the individuals are trying to establish themselves in the labour market having now graduated from the apprenticeship but still face the same context and backdrop and a greater need to broaden their horizons and career direction:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. To achieve both quantitative and qualitative improvements in the development of the participants as footballers\r\n\r\n2.
