All the participants can be considered vulnerable people as they have dyslexia. The mobility will last for 6 days (and 2 travel days) and its activities will be implemented in Malta. The youth exchange will be held from the 23 till 30 July 2016 (including travel days). The objectives of this project can be listed as follows:1) The sharing of experiences: Support is essential for people with special needs. In fact providing support to people with dyslexia was one of the main reasons which led to the establishment of the European Dyslexia Association. Today a number of events are organised every year in order to bring together people with dyslexia to share their experiences and discuss how they have learned to cope with the difficulties which they have to face on a daily basis due to this disability. 2) To build a strong sense of self esteem: Low self esteem is often one of the main problems of people with dyslexia. The frustration of children with dyslexia often centers on their inability to meet expectations. Their parents and teachers see a bright, enthusiastic child who is not learning to read and write. Time and again, dyslexics and their parents hear, \"He's such a bright child; if only he would try harder.\" Ironically, no one knows exactly how hard the dyslexic is trying. 3) To improve the communication skills of the participants: People with dyslexia usually find communication challenging for a number of reasons, mainly due to i) lack of verbal fluency and lack of precision in speech; and ii) word-finding problems. Our project includes a number of discussions which will make it possible for our participants to speak up and gain confidence when expressing themselves. 4) To promote active citizenship: Our participants will be meeting the EC and EP respresentatives in Malta who will be providing information about the EU's strategy to assist people with dyslexia. In addition, they will also meet one of Malta's representatives in the European Parliament in order to discuss the role of a parliamentarian and how young people can have a more active role in society and politics. 5) To promote physical activity and sport: One of the challenges of this project is to keep the participants focused at all times - in order to do this we have to keep our youths interested in the programme. 6) To establish a better relationship between the participating organisations. Our project will include the following activities:- Introductory activities: these activities will be held on the first day and they include an introductory talk by the group leaders and a number of ice breaking games.  - Discussions: we want to give our participants the opportunity to express themselves and realise that their opinions are valued by others. We want them to speak up and formulate their own thoughts about the subject being discussed. Aside from this self-empowering principle, we also know that through discussions our participants can learn a lot from each other. This is in fact one of the reasons why our organisations decided to apply for this youth exchange project. - Presentations: our project involves a presentation session that will also take place during the first day of the exchange. Basically the participants from each State will have to prepare a 15 minute presentation about their country. The presentation will include information about the history, culture and geography of the country amongst other interesting facts. This will provide the participants.Aside from the overriding aspect of self esteem, this project will also impact our participants in a number of ways. The following list includes what we believe are the most prominent implications of the programme of activities on these young people:1) Improvement in communication skills; 2) Encouragement to do sports activities;3) Better understanding of how to cope with dyslexia;4) Better understanding of how young people can lead active civic lives despite their conditions,5) Acquire knowledge about the employment opportunities in the EU.  Ultimately, the end result of this project will be more empowered young people who have a stronger self esteem and a sense of self worth. People with dyslexia often suffer from a low self esteem and the activities of this project all intend to change this situation so that the individual starts to believe more in himself/herself and the essential contribution that they can give to the community in which they live in.", "http://www.dyslexiascotland.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-MT01-KA105-015116_4"]]}}, "1QZ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1496275200000, 1653955200000, "COproductioN with NaturE for City Transitioning, INnovation and Governance", "Greenspace Scotland", "The overarching objective of CONNECTING is to position Europe as a global leader in the innovation and implementation of nature-based solutions.

Presently there is not requirement of teaching applicants to be proficient in an additional language so there is a language proficiency gap throughout the teaching profession in Scotland that needs to be addressed in order to meet the Scottish Government's objectives. To this end, Stirling Council offers French language training to primary teachers via a 19 week programme facilitated by high school teachers one day a week after school as well as monthly opportunities to exchange ideas and resources via the Grab and Go sessions. Riverside Primary is already a school of languages. In addition to education in English, Riverside offers Gaelic Medium education, education to children with ASD and has a diverse population of pupils, some whose native language is a language other than English. The language mobility project is facilitated by a training provider in Scotland who organises a week  of French language and cultural experiences in France. There is a focus on improving one's competence in French  and the teaching of French. Additionally, the course meets the learners' needs by offering differentiated learning according to one's proficiency. Participants are encouraged to bring and share resources and there is a requirement to demonstrate the knowledge gained by presenting a lesson to the group.  Prior to departure, the organiser provides a reading list to participants to support the professional dialogue  of the week's learning.Participation in this language mobility project will serve to improve the competence of two teachers at Riverside to speak and teach French to their classes. This project will also allow the teachers to gather resources, gain new ideas and share these with their colleagues upon their return. One teacher's cultural knowledge of the French language relates to that of the Quebecois in Canada, as that is where she grew up. She would benefit greatly from an immersion experience in France in order to gain insight and appreciation of French culture. The second teacher also has some knowledge of French, having taken coursework in high school, but she realises she needs to improve her command of the French language in order to teach it to her own class.The teachers will keep track of their learning by keeping a learning portfolio which will be shared with their Head teacher upon their return to school. This learning portfolio will provide the basis for their presentation to their teaching colleagues and will include: resources, reflections of the learning undertaken as well as ideas to support language learning.The envisaged results and longer-term impact   -improved competence, confidence and ability to teach French.   -gained greater cultural awareness of France that can be imparted to pupils.   -access to new resources (physical and those uploads to the shared drive on Glow)   -option to take part in drop in sessions for French resources for topics already studied in English   -participating teachers, in consultation with the 1+2 Development Coordinator, will offer input to the local authority's developmental actions relating to implementing 1+2 in Stirling Schools.
