Cyber-physical systems are very hard to control and verify because of the mix of discrete dynamics (originating from computing elements) and continuous dynamics (originating from physical elements). We present completely new methods for de-verticalisation of the development processes by a generic and holistic approach towards reliable cyber-physical systems development with formal guarantees. In order to guarantee that specifications are met in unknown environments and in unanticipated situations, we synthesise and verify controllers on-the-fly during system execution. This requires to unify control and verification approaches, which were previously considered separately by developers. For instance, each action of an automated car (e.g. lane change) is verified before execution, guaranteeing safety of the passengers. We will develop completely new methods, which are integrated in tools for modelling, control design, verification, and code generation that will leverage the development towards reliable and at the same time open cyber-physical systems. Our approach leverages future certification needs of open and critical cyber-physical systems. The impact of this project is far-reaching and long-term: UnCoVerCPS prepares the EU to be able to develop critical cyber-physical systems that can only be realised and certified when uncertainties in the environment are adequately considered.

Furthermore, the robotic arm motions usually do not rely on characteristics of the human motion dynamics, while the object transfer itself is generally realized without using sensing information as the human does with his hand.CogLaboration proposes to address this challenge by achieving three objectives. First, we will study the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of successful human-human object exchange in realistic task settings and conditions, including typical variations and unplanned and unanticipated situations. This observation aims to characterize the arm and hand trajectories, the force applied onto the object during the exchange, the visual information used to correct the motion, and the way gestures are used to provide information or trigger the exchange procedure. Second, we will develop a hierarchical control architecture based on state-of-the-art concepts from cognitive neurosciences and exploiting the key-characteristics of the human-human exchange to provide the robot with the required cognitive abilities. Third, we will build a vision-driven robotic system comprising a lightweight arm and a hand with tactile sensors and evaluate it against the same metrics that we will have derived from our studies of object exchange between humans.

The curriculum at James Brindley is creative and exciting and we truly embrace the philosophy of Excellence and Enjoyment.\r\n\r\nFrom 2018, we're set to embark on a period of phased growth to become a two-form entry school, doubling our number of pupils and teaching staff.\r\n\r\nIn our most recent OFSTED inspection we progressed from a \"Good\" to an \"Outstanding\" school. We are extremely proud of our achievements, but continue to remain focused on school improvement so that we can provide the best start for our young learners. Our School improvement plan therefore aims to focus on challenge and push all learners to access wider provision in key areas and forge a link between the different subjects. We will bring the same determination to this project as our other recent experiences to make it a real success.\r\n\r\nAt James Brindley, we have a strong belief in the importance and value of languages in our young learners' futures and prosperity. French is currently taught across KS2 by our in-house specialist, Mrs Hughes. Our pupils therefore have a strong foundation in language-learning, upon which we are seeking to optimise in order to fully prepare them for KS3 and beyond.\r\n\r\nWe are a growing school. We need to ensure that our language teaching achieves the same outstanding standards as our other teaching, giving us the skills and experience to support other schools. We need to take a whole school approach to truly embed outstanding teaching across every aspect of our school life.\r\n\r\nIt is widely recognised that being in the target language country or amongst the culture is the best way to learn a language and understand another culture.  Our project will focus on dissemination and sharing of skills across the school, but we feel that the only way to ensure outstanding, sustainable provision, truly embracing the languages curriculum and an international dimension is through involving a high number of staff in actual immersion activities and allowing them to experience all the benefits that can only come from being in the country.\r\n\r\nOur key strategic aim is for all staff to become confident and competent with French. A recently conducted staff audit shows that staff do not currently feel confident enough with the vocabulary, grammar structure or pronunciation to deliver high quality teaching. We predict that, as a direct result of this project, all staff will become competent and confident enough to teach French to pupils within the classroom up to and including Key Stage 2.\r\n\r\nWe seek to raise the awareness of the significance and importance of learning new languages and equip our teaching staff with the linguistic and cultural skills to be able to plan for and deliver a sustainable model of foreign language teaching at James Brindley Community School.\r\n\r\nWe will share our learning across the school in order to develop the awareness of French as a principal language in the global community and promote a supportive, whole school approach that values every member of staff.\r\n\r\nWe hope to raise the aspirations and life experiences of pupils in our school. We want them to become more involved as considerate and active European citizens. We aim to provide the foundations of language learning that will encourage them to consider the importance of learning new languages as a gateway to a better and more connected future.\r\n\r\nWe plan for everybody in school to be involved in our project to enhance their French knowledge and be in the best position to help create a sustainable model of language teaching in our school, so participating in an immersion programme in France will be opened to everybody in our school.  \r\n\r\nOur scale large project will have a major impact on our participants, learners, and school as a whole.
