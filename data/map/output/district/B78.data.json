The poor condition and lack of maintenance of European roads contribute to at least one third of all accidents each year, and accounting to 52.7% of fatalities in 2011. Potholes also hold the distinction of being the most aggravating road distress to the traveling public in general.\n\nPothole repair generally accounts for a significant portion of transportation departments\u2019 operating budget, with more than \u20ac1,2 billion being directly attributed to fill nearly 20 million potholes in Europe during 2011, but only half of Europe's potholes were treated. This can be attributed to the high initial costs associated with maintenance activities, the historically poor performance of patching which often necessitates additional maintenance work, and the exorbitant safety and legal costs associated with the need for traffic control of these activities. As such, any improvements or advancements in this area could result in substantial cost savings.\n\nAs a response to this need, a potholer repair method that will significantly reduce the direct costs (cost of repair) and indirect costs (cost of user compensation, traffic disrupts, etc.) associated with road maintenance activities is required. Specifically, increased effectiveness and better productivity during pothole repair and enhanced longevity of potholes use are required.\n\nThe proposed solution is to develop a fully automatic, via robotic vision and computer-control, and adaptive, via an expert system, pothole repair system with integrated quality assurance mechanisms, as well as a new, robust patch material blend - an emulsified asphalt emulsion - that lend itself to the automatic process and demonstrates excellent performance.", 244616.0, 1081153.0, 4, 7, "HOLEINONE", null, "http://www.instarmac.co.uk", null, "fp7_192281_952801610"]]}}, "3HL": {"creative": {"data": [[1425340800000, 1535846400000, "Astrologaster", "NYAMYAM LIMITED", 48379.0, 1, 1, "Astrologaster is a humorous \"biographical\" adventure game based on real-world historical figure Simon Forman, Elizabethan doctor, astrologer and alchemist. Players take the role of Forman, casting astrological charts (using intuitive touch actions to manipulate beautiful papercut charts inspired by actual astronomical instruments of the day) to answer questions about the future, the past, and sickness. If patients are happy with the predictions and treatment received, the player gains status, wealth and influence over London society. If patients are dissatisfied, the player runs an ever greater risk of, being revealed as a charlatan, thrown into prison or sued for malpractice by the royal college of physicians. As the player navigates the spider's web of patients, emergent narratives reveals deeper intrigues and makes us wonder whether it was really all 'written in the stars'.Simon Forman is a well-known historic figure of the age, he was considered a sage by some and a charlatan by others. His dealings were occasionally considered notorious, but the casebooks he left behind offer a unique documentary insight into medical practice at the time and the society in which he lived. Funding from the Wellcome Trust has allowed a team of academics at Cambridge University, led by Lauren Kassell, to digitise the records of 80,000 consultations by Forman and his associate Richard Napier, which form Astrologaster is based on.", "http://www.nyamyam.com", "NYAMYAM LIMITED", "creative_577628-CREA-1-2016-1-UK-MED-DEVVG_coordinator"]]}}, "3NG": {"nhs": {"data": [["RRE", "The George Bryan Centre", "nhs_RRE58"]]}}}}
