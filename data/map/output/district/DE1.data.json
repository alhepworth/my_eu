This leads young people to find alternative ways to feel a sense of identity and to have a voice through forming segmented groups, or gangs, based on post codes, ethnicity or cultural background.\r\n\r\nFrom a lack of empowerment and belonging, nor appropriate forums to express needs, concerns and dreams, young people are resorting to having a voice through negative, deconstructive means.\r\n \r\nThose who attempt to express themselves through mediums which they identify with, such as graffiti, urban music, street art and street sports, are in most cases ignored by the wider society as \u2018anti-social\u2019, which in turn means the young person fulfils the label that society has handed them.\r\n\r\nIn order to address this problem, youth organisations who work in urban environments with young people with fewer opportunities need to have a clear understanding of their culture and their identity and through that understanding have the tools to channel their voice and sense of belonging through positive social action.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this is a problem that needs to be addressed not on a national level, but internationally across Europe and its Neighbours, since our modern cities are themselves international, and require international solutions.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to promote urban culture and art  as a positive expression of young peoples participation\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this aim the following objective have been identified:\r\n\r\n1. To ensure youth workers have capacity to reflect upon and respond to the challenges and conflicts faced by young people with fewer opportunities in urban areas\r\n\r\n2. To give youth leaders capacity to engage young people with fewer opportunities in positive social action through Urban Arts\r\n\r\n3.
