This will be done by the development of an innovative story-telling based e-training, facilitating volunteers and caregivers in valuable conversations. Development takes place in close collaboration with the target groups. The three-year project will be executed by a transnational consortium of five partners, from four different countries (NL, LU, UK, AU). The partner organisations are representatives of (lonely) elderly people, a design partner with expertise in co-design and a technical partner with experience in technical solutions for the older population.\r\nLoneliness is a serious problem among the elderly in Europe. In the Netherlands, there are over 4.1 billion people aged 55+. Out of these, 200,000 feel extremely lonely: they have social contact only once a month. In the United Kingdom, 1.2 million older people indicate chronic feelings of loneliness. Chronic feelings of loneliness can bring people down into a spiral of social exclusion. \r\nOlder people with a lower literacy level are especially at risk of social exclusion as participation in current knowledge based societies are very much based on the ability to read and write. Storytelling can help them to make sense of their lives and connect them with their social environment. We use stories constantly; to inform, to connect with others or to share our feelings.  Stories are used to organize our thoughts, find meaning and purpose and establish a sense of identity in this world. This is also why some people keep a journal organising their thoughts by writing them down on a regular basis. The proposed project aims to use these principles of storytelling in the development of a training against loneliness.   \r\nDigital developments provide new opportunities in sharing personal narratives. However, many elderly people feel hesitant using them. They are for instance anxious to retain their privacy and distinguish between what they want to share with family, close friends or acquaintances. This is particularly true for those with a low literacy level. This is a pity as these digital tools may help to arrange, capture and use stories.  \r\nTaking into account the needs of older people with low (digital) literacy levels and those working with them, our project aims to develop an e-training especially focusing on this target group. Following a structure of six work packages, the project will deliver five intellectual Outputs:\r\n- Intellectual Output 1 includes an offline training, integrating known principles in the field of storytelling which are relevant to use to combat loneliness among our target groups;\r\n-Intellectual Output 2 contains an e-training in which the offline tool is translated into a digital instrument.

Through a multidisciplinary and peer to peer knowledge sharing with students of other countries the project will foster among learners a better understanding of the religion impact on local communities and habits and through mutual knowledge the project will enhance pupils social, civic and intercultural competences and promote their active role in the integration of migrant/asylum seekers/refugees students. \r\n- Promote among students of different confessions, the capacity of a critical analysis and understanding of the role played by religions in the history of mankind, highlighting according to an historical perspective, the events  in which religions and religious authorities played a negative role, leading to persecutions, massacres and wars and those in which religions and religious authorities choices fostered peace and integration.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these results the project will develop 3 Intellectual Outputs and involve the stakeholders, that is secondary school teachers and students, in their testing:\r\n\r\n- A Guide addressed to secondary teachers in order to deal with complex classroom realities, resulting from migrations and refugees phenomenon.

The project will take place between 1st September 2016 and 31st October 2018 and is aimed at representatives of local education centres, i.e. at the directors of these institutions and the teaching staff who give lessons to groups of learners aged 60+. The consortium has been structured to ensure that various local education facilities with a range of main strengths and focuses are involved as well as trans-regionally active associations.    The objective of Silver Learners is to improve the programme offered by education centres, taking into account the challenges of demographic change as well as the associated altered circumstances and education practices of senior citizens. The older generation needs to be provided with educational support to enable them to remain active members of society and face the challenges of growing old independently for as long as possible. In this context, the fields of media competence (using ICT and new technical resources) and health are regarded as being particularly significant.  In addition, it is essential to reach poorly educated target groups. Elderly people with a migration background, for instance, rarely attend education institutions.It is planned to communicate tried-and-tested education models from the various countries for improving the learning situation of the elderly and also to jointly develop and implement ideas and concepts. New, innovative educational concepts for the older generation are to be developed on the basis of the different experiences. Since, at present, the adult education centres are primarily attended by the so-called middle classes, the current objective is to focus on persons who have had fewer educational opportunities, including those with a migrant background.  This will entail analysing the motivation for learning as well as the options and the existing barriers to education. The project comprises six meetings of the project partners. The time between these meetings will be used for processing the results and disseminating and applying them locally as well as for preparing the next convention. The meetings of the partners are to be organised as workshops made up of presentations, dialogues in varying work groups, and excursions. The following issues are regarded as particularly crucial:- Competencies and learning abilities of the elderly and the consequent requirements on educational programmes;- Communication for and with senior citizens - How can the target groups be reached, in particular those that are not so well educated? How can the communication skills of older people be intensified (use of ICT, social networks, language, etc.)?- Further education for everyday life \u2013 How can the older generation be supported in their ICT-influenced daily lives (using a PC, online banking/shopping/booking)? How can new tools be made appropriate for elderly people?- Further education on health \u2013 Besides keeping healthy (sport, prevention) and new technical aids, this focuses mainly on dealing with age-related diseases such as dementia. The venues and thematic focuses of the meetings have been selected so as to ensure that the partners can best introduce their strengths into the discussion. Meetings are to be held in Iserlohn, Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, Luxembourg, Bunnik, Stockport and Chorz\u00f3w. The first event will be organised as an introductory kick-off meeting. Then, after four content-related workshops, there will be a summarising wrap-up meeting at which future, more extensive, cooperative ventures are to be planned.Besides the specified aims, teaching staff will benefit from the project because their skills will be upgraded, especially regarding the interests of the elderly during lessons, the effective use of ICT, and the inclusion of health aspects. This will enable education centres to improve and expand what they offer and thus for attendees to commit to the institution.   Working together with familiar partners (town twinning, successful partnerships in other EU projects) will reinforce the networks and enable them to be redefined with the help of new partners. The project partners get to know other countries, embark on intercultural dialogues and expand their knowledge, including their linguistic skills. The project will be beneficial to society in Europe as well: well-educated, committed and health-conscious senior citizens face the effects accompanying age with greater confidence.
