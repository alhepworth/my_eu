The critical mass will be created by the KConnect Professional Services Community, which will consist of at least 30 companies by the end of the project. These companies will be trained to build solutions based on the KConnect Services, hence serving as multipliers for commercial exploitation of the KConnect services.\nThe KConnect project will facilitate the straightforward adaptation of the commercialised services to new languages by providing toolkits enabling the adaptation to be done by by people having a software engineering skillset, as opposed to the rarer language engineering skillset. The KConnect services will also be adapted to handle text in Electronic Health Records, which is particularly challenging due to misspellings, neologisms, organisation-specific acronyms, and heavy use of negation and hedging. \nThe consortium is driven by a core group of four innovative SMEs following complementary business perspectives related to medical text analysis and search. These companies will build solutions for their customers based on KConnect technology. Two partners from the medical domain will use KConnect services to solve their medical record analysis challenges.

At systemic level, we expect to awaken a modernisation of education.  \r\n\r\nThrough this project we will engage and widen the school community and reinforce our response to the main challenges of today's world in particular active participation in democratic life by realising and owning change. \r\n\r\nSchools will be developed as Learning & Thinking centres of excellence from which the wider community can play an important role in the educational standards of our young learners. By combining life skills with thinking skills and vision for the future we will inspire engagement thus raising standards amongst our pupils especially those who are considered disadvantaged.  Through these actions we will support schools in tackling lack of engagement which often leads to early school leaving. In addition we will engage local businesses to help support our local communities in gaining the appropriate skills set.\r\n\r\nWe have a combined  vision with regard to empowering and supporting  achievement amongst young people, their families and the wider community.

Wherever possible local businesses and entrepreneurs will be included sharing their expertise and offering work experience opportunities to older students. We will involve families from the school community and the wider community.\r\nTraining events will be held within the participating schools and the community will be encouraged to come together in intergenerational learning and making progress towards our goal of developing participating schools as LTT centres of excellence.\r\nTeachers from partner schools will take part in job-shadowing and pupils will take part in pupil exchange visits to partner countries. \r\nStrand 3 - Action Community Project\r\nIn this final part of the project schools will work together with the wider communities to put into play the actions they have deemed important and necessary for the wellbeing of pupils and residents in the local area. \r\nA focus will be put on the skills learned by pupils and the participating adults.  \r\nOnce complete the projects will be disseminated in multiplier events in each region.

In learning about other cultures and traditions and comparing them with their own, children in the \u2018Little Euro Guides\u2019 project will develop acceptance and respect for the diverse range of cultures present across our countries.    The project aims to directly engage with 900 participants aged 4-11 across 5 schools in Wales, Turkey, Greece, Portugal and Italy, The majority of pupils in half of the partner schools face social and economic disadvantage, and a significant proportion have special needs.    Pupils in each school will engage in creative activities to explore the culture, traditions, famous landmarks and traditional games of the other countries in the project. These include: creating physical and digital 3D models of landmarks, creating artwork illustrating festivals and traditions, performing and filming national dances, and producing short films as tour guides to introduce their own country to the other schools. Each school will exhibit their work in their \u2018project corner\u2019 and share it online. Throughout the project pupils and teachers will develop digital skills through creating films and using online flipbooks, websites and Skype. While hosting teachers from the other countries, each school will also hold a traditional food workshop. An important part of the project is the short term joint staff training event.  This event will add value to the project by equipping the staff who attend from each partner school with skills and knowledge in the areas of movie creation and editing, a deeper understanding of digital learning in the 21st Century and practical ways of integrating this into their teaching.    The \u2018Little Euro Guides\u2019 project will develop a sense of national pride, cultivate a feeling of belonging to the European Union and inspire a life-long interest in international collaboration. Young people will develop a range of basic and transversal skills through the project which will improve their employability and widen their opportunities later in life. The students will learn to problem solve, collaborate, think critically and take initiative. They will develop digital competence, another crucial transversal skill, which opens the door to further learning and cultural awareness. The project will train young people to confidently and creatively use ICT to learn about other cultures, connect with others and exhibit their creative work. Further benefits of the project include improved English language skills, developed creative skills, awakened interest in other cultures and languages, and a sense of responsibility and pride in achieving something of value.     Through sharing good practice and creative methodology, the teachers partnering in the project will ensure long term impact as their experience informs their future practice. They will also seek opportunities to share their learning with their peers locally, widening the impact to other schools in their networks.
