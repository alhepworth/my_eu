The task-based main focus will be on acquiring and broadening skills and competences in the fields of language, culture and interculturality, nursery and child care as well as personal development and interpersonal skills. Furthermore, it is the aim of the project to enable the participants, by means of comparing the relevant pedagogical approaches, to get to know and learn about European educational concepts, in particular early childhood education. To that end, the participants will have the opportunity to compare both the concepts and the practical work in Germany and the European partners with a clear focus on educational and social backgrounds as well as pedagogical concepts and methodology. In that connection, the salient points are the challenge of early learning and inclusion. By intensifying adaptability, coooperation, linguistic competence, flexibility, ability to reflect, independence and generally broadening horizons, the participants will enhance their personal, interpersonal and professional skills.
