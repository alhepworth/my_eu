As a result of the Scottish Government's 1+2 programme we are having to introduce modern foreign languages to the children of the school from the ages of 4. This is quite a task for us up here due to our remoteness. \r\n\r\nI have identified a course run by LFEE based in Santiago De Compostela that can help us in our goal of the successful introduction of languages. I previously attended o course run by LFEE in Malaga in October 2017 and I found it was fantastic - it was well led, with good organisation and fantastic resources. This course has been instrumental in helping us implement spanish at school. The course in Santiago is a follow up course to this.\r\n\r\nThe courses aims are\r\nTo provide participants with fresh materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of Spanish at primary/early secondary level, including new games and songs\r\nTo reinforce their methodological expertise in the teaching of Spanish, focusing on cross-curricular learning\r\nTo develop a better cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary Spain by discovering the exceptional cultural heritage of the region of Galicia (this also includes a possible visit to a Spanish school depending on our partners\u2019 availability)\r\nTo further improve participants\u2019 competence and performance in Spanish, looking in particular at grammar and sentence building\r\nTo continue to develop knowledge of ICT tools suitable for the language classroom\r\n\r\nThese match more or less exactly to what our school needs in order to keep up the momentum for us to teach spanish. As I speak Spanish a bit already I am keen to further enhance my knowledge and I am excited to be be able to use this knowledge as part of my career. I am also keen to develop my knowledge of a new area of Spain that I know little about and am keen to explore ideas to share this knowledge with the children.\r\n\r\nAfter consultation with my headteacher, I  have contacted LFEE and they have reserved me a place on this course.\r\nIf I receive funding I will contact LFEE and make suitable arrangements for my travel. I will also carry out all necessary preparation for the course.\r\n\r\nAfter the course I hope to use these new ideas and materials to invigorate the teaching of languages at school and to prepare relevant materials. My headteacher will monitor lessons to see how materials from the course are being used in the classroom. She will also expect me to disseminate information about the course with colleagues.  I am also part of the languages task group for our local area so there will be opportunities for me to share what I have learnt beyond the school.\r\n\r\nWe are starting to embed spanish language across the school through school wide activities which is something that we are very keep to keep up. But in addition to this I teach the P6/7 stand alone spanish lessons. \r\n\r\nWe have not had the opportunity to develop links with Spanish schools yet through etwinning but this is something that we are keen to explore in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is now the second year that we have had links with LFEE and we are keen to maintain this link.", "http://www.cromartyprimary.wordpress.com", "Cromarty Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046821_coordinator"], [2017, "Language training", "Cromarty Primary School", 1749.0, 1, 1, "Although I speak some spanish already I would like to be able to teach it to children at my school. This fits in with the national 1+2 policy for teaching languages.\r\nI have sufficient spanish to communicate with children but need to develop my confidence in methods of teaching languages.\r\nIn order to do this I have identified a one week immersion course being run by LFEE in Malaga in October 2017. The aims of this course match the needs I have identified in myself in order to be able to move the school forward.  These are:\r\nTo improve methodological expertise in the teaching of Spanish to young learners.\r\nTo provide materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of Spanish at primary level.\r\nTo develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary Spain.\r\nTo improve  competence and performance in Spanish.\r\nTo use Internet and other ICT resources in your class.\r\nAfter consultation with my headteacher, I  have contacted LFEE and they have reserved me a place on this course.\r\nIf I receive funding I will contact LFEE and make suitable arrangements for my travel. I will also carry out all necessary preparation for the course.\r\nDuring my week in Spain, I hope to meet like minded colleagues from other countries. I also hope to make links with spanish schools which can be continued on my return to Scotland. I also hope to gain lots of practical games, resources and ideas for teaching spanish to children. I also hope to develop a plan for implementing spanish into my primary classroom.\r\n\r\nOn my return I will continue to develop resources and start to teach spanish in my school. I will share what I have learnt with my colleagues in my own school (and cluster of local primary schools) and establish links with the language department at the secondary school.  The school will include the wider community by holding a languages assembly to which the press will be invited.", "http://www.cromartyprimary.wordpress.com", "Cromarty Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035364_coordinator"]]}}}}
