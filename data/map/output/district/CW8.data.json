It is necessary that teachers discover new teaching activities and procedures. The classical approach in teaching STEM (science, technology, engineering y mathematics) creates passive learners; while it\u2019s important to engage pupils in order to have them take an active role (Bednar, Coughlin, Evans, & Sievers, 2002).\r\nTherefore, in order to achieve this aim we\u2019re going to teach based on multiple intelligences using outdoor activites. We think that learning should not only prepare one for life, but should also be an integral part of life itself. Simulating real problems and real problem-solving is one function of project based learning. Projects assist students in succeeding within the classroom and beyond, because they allow learners to apply multiple intelligences in completing a project they can be proud of. Our society values individuals who can solve problems creatively, using multiple strengths, so why shouldn't we encourage students to do the same?  \r\nThis project will be carried out by secondary school students (12-16 year-old). Students with different social backgrounds will be involved and work together in all activities. Target groups of 50 pupils will be formed in each partner school to participate directly in activities, although our aim is that all school students take part in it either directly or indirectly. On the other hand a group of teachers will be coordinating and supervising activities in each school. \r\n\r\nOur aim is that activities will be carried out for all students, that means students with different competences, intelligences, capacities and social backgrounds. We\u2019ve designed next activities:\r\n1. Erasmus+ corner at each school \r\n2. Website on Etwinning and a Project website to share all the process and activities.\r\n3. In the journalist's footsteps: surveys about our project topic. \r\n4. My school is cool \u2013 Lipdub: Students prepare a lipdub at their schools.\r\n5. Camping experience: Students spend 2-3 days camping. They will be hiking, collecting materials, building models and drawing geographics maps. There will also do a geocaching activity.\r\n6. My universe: Students will learn about astronomy, visit a science centre where do direct observations and interviews. \r\n7. Solidarity Event: Students take part in organising a solidary event at their schools. \r\n8. My history: Students find out about their local history, by asking people in the families and old members of community. Finally, they have to tell the story to the class by using drama. \r\n9. As a weatherman: Students observe the weather regularly, and they keep a record in a data base, prepare a weather forecast as TV presenter, print results weekly, make comparisons with other partners result, etc.\r\n10. Let's move - Erasmus+ flashmob: Students play a flashmob. They learn to dance and play. \r\n11. Graffiti Wall: Students draw graffiti wall abouty their feelings or everything they want to show or talk about.  \r\n12. Model making: Students analyze their enviroment (countryside, forest, etc) based on model making. Also, they will model means of transport, and use it to study movement, friction, etc. \r\n\r\nOur methodology will be based on 3 key aspects:\r\n-Multiple Intelligences: Each student is different so we have to provide them different tools to reach the objectives. Therefore, we should move from traditional teaching strategies to 21st century teaching scenarios.\r\n\r\n-Outdoor enviroment: we think that to help all the students to use their full thinking potential, it is necessary not only to teach them in classroom what a good mindset is, also we need to find ways to convince students of the value of the teaching. Because outdoor and adventurous activities facilitates authentic or experiential learning and gives better access to the main pathways to learning.\r\n\r\n-ICT and new technologies: they will be pivotal to the success of our project. We're living in a digital world.\r\n\r\nBy mixing of all these components, our aim is to increase students\u2019 motivation by promoting active learning through direct personal experiences. We\u2019re going to deal with each activity from the 8 intelligences (Howard Gardner model).\r\n\r\nExpected RESULTS are: websites, computer presentations, leaflets, posters, videos, books, costumes, mockups, school panels, plays, surveys, interviews, graphs, films, drawings and paintings, photos, writings, etc. \r\n\r\nThe desired IMPACT on the participants, participating organisations, target groups and other relevant stakeholders will be using new methodologies to improve quality education, open student\u2019s minds in all senses (towards Europe, Education, cooperation, etc), be aware of ICT culture and how to use it to solve problems, and improve student\u2019s motivation as well.", "http://www.st-nicholas.cheshire.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA219-016008_1"]]}}, "2ES": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "A Step Beyond 2018", "Nunsmere Hall Limited", 85026.0, 4, 16, "According to the curriculum for our type of school, students must participate in an internship for 12 weeks.

In this programme pupils gain an extra qualification and through the networking of foreign languages in various vocational subjects, the students achieve a higher level of linguistic competence.

They should also experience the importance of key skills such as a capacity for teamwork or the ability to work under pressure and thus also develop their own personality. This is entirely in keeping with the LINGUA philosophy, which encourages the students to actively use their foreign languages and develop a love for language which will form a basis for life-long learning after their time at school. Integral parts of the LINGUA concept are the application of drama in education, CLIL , the language certificates and these very internships in EU member-states.

In parallel, the manufacturing processes of the future are changing and need to be highly flexible and dynamic in order to satisfy customer demands for, e.g. large series production, mass customization, or changing orders.\nTo keep pace with the needs of the manufacturing industry of the future, in Manufacturing 4.0 companies need to flexibly react to these demands and be able to offer production capacities in a rapid way. Thus companies looking for manufacturing capacity need to be supported by the means to find these capacities, configure them, and integrate them into their own manufacturing processes.\nTo achieve this, one obvious approach is to port successful concepts from the field of Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) and Cloud computing to manufacturing to mirror agile collaboration through flexible and scalable manufacturing processes: \n\u2022 Leasing and releasing manufacturing assets in an on-demand, utility-like fashion.\n\u2022 Rapid elasticity through scaling leased assets up and down if necessary.\n\u2022 Pay-per-use through metered service.\nApplying these principles, Cloud manufacturing can move manufacturing processes from production-oriented to service-oriented networks by modelling single manufacturing assets as services in a similar way as SaaS or PaaS solutions. By modelling all process steps and manufacturing assets as services it is possible to realize cross-organization manufacturing orchestrations and integrate distributed resources and ultimately manufacture products more efficiently.\nWhile the theoretical foundations for Cloud manufacturing are manifest there are no proven tools and technologies exist in the market - CREMA aims to change this fact by providing Cloud-based Rapid Elastic Manufacturing based on SaaS and Cloud model.", 600295.0, 4284564.0, 6, 13, "CREMA", null, null, null, "h2020_193459_936397940"], [1475280000000, 1569801600000, "Decentralised Agile Coordination Across Supply Chains", "Information Catalyst for Enterprise Ltd", "European manufacturing competes in a global knowledge-driven economy, and thus increasingly seeks competitive advantage through quality, agility and personalisation based on latest advances in IT.

Most relevant to achieve the expected increase of production performance for highly customized products is to master the complexity of the supply chain and logistics in the global production networks.
