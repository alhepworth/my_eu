The advanced prototype system will be validated via deployment to inspect a long barrel demonstrator component panel, which is to be developed in the Clean Sky 2 Programme using hybrid materials technology.\n\nThe technical approach is to use non-contact laser generated pulsed ultrasound (LUT) with delivery of both the laser ultrasound excitation and detection pulses through flexible optical fibres scanned with a 6 axis lightweight robot arm to provide an  area coverage (scan window) substantially exceeding of 1.5m x 1.5m from a single location of the robot base. LUT Signal processing algorithms will be used for (i) the reduction of coherent noise from fibres and (ii) Random signal to noise ratio enhancement using LUT synthetic aperture focusing.\n\nThe robot arm will move on a rail track that runs the length of one side of the barrel demonstrator panel which will be positioned and fixed within the system cell. The robot arm will raster the laser head system over the part surface, and move in increments along the track to inspect the whole component, at speeds of>8m2 per hour. It is envisioned that the part will be scanned in less than 4 scan windows.", 315733.0, 2157206.0, 3, 4, "ACCURATE", null, null, null, "h2020_210621_917003663"]]}}, "8HD": {"cordis": {"data": [[1420070400000, 1514678400000, "Cloud-based Rapid Elastic MAnufacturing", "Dot-Net-It Limited", "Due to the proliferation of ICT Technologies, manufacturing industry is undergoing substantial transformation in terms of HW but also in terms of Cyber-Physical Production Systems and the SW and services used within production environments. In parallel, the manufacturing processes of the future are changing and need to be highly flexible and dynamic in order to satisfy customer demands for, e.g. large series production, mass customization, or changing orders.\nTo keep pace with the needs of the manufacturing industry of the future, in Manufacturing 4.0 companies need to flexibly react to these demands and be able to offer production capacities in a rapid way. Thus companies looking for manufacturing capacity need to be supported by the means to find these capacities, configure them, and integrate them into their own manufacturing processes.\nTo achieve this, one obvious approach is to port successful concepts from the field of Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) and Cloud computing to manufacturing to mirror agile collaboration through flexible and scalable manufacturing processes: \n\u2022 Leasing and releasing manufacturing assets in an on-demand, utility-like fashion.\n\u2022 Rapid elasticity through scaling leased assets up and down if necessary.\n\u2022 Pay-per-use through metered service.\nApplying these principles, Cloud manufacturing can move manufacturing processes from production-oriented to service-oriented networks by modelling single manufacturing assets as services in a similar way as SaaS or PaaS solutions. By modelling all process steps and manufacturing assets as services it is possible to realize cross-organization manufacturing orchestrations and integrate distributed resources and ultimately manufacture products more efficiently.\nWhile the theoretical foundations for Cloud manufacturing are manifest there are no proven tools and technologies exist in the market - CREMA aims to change this fact by providing Cloud-based Rapid Elastic Manufacturing based on SaaS and Cloud model.", 41959.0, 4284564.0, 6, 13, "CREMA", null, null, null, "h2020_193459_934903267"]]}}, "8WG": {"cordis": {"data": [[1401580800000, 1469923200000, "On-line early damage diagnosis, prognosis and root cause analysis for Industrial multi-stage gearboxes used in the water industry", "Eriks Industrial Services Limited", "The balance between water demand and availability has reached a critical level in many areas of Europe, according to the European Environment Agency and it is expected that the situation will be exacerbated in future by climate and social change.\n\nThe UN Environment Programme reports that trends indicate a 40% rise in average water consumption by Europeans over the next 20 years, while EC statistics show that total freshwater resources are at relatively low levels (below 3,000m\u00b3 per capita) in the six largest Member States (Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Poland and the UK), as well as in Belgium, Denmark and the Czech Republic.\n\nIt is clear that the treatment of wastewater has a key and growing role to play in addressing this problem and will require an increase in the number of water treatment facilities available.\n\nEuropean wastewater treatment plants delivering high-quality clean water from sewage face a number of unresolved problems related to gearbox operation.
