In order to develop cohesively and inclusively, education and training needs to develop plans and strategies that will allow citizens to play an active role in democratic life.  Therefore, the role of educators plays an important part in breaking down barriers to learning and prevent violent radicalisation by promoting common European values, fostering social integration, enhancing intercultural understanding and a sense of belonging to a community, hence supporting integration of all learners no matter their background and personal situation.  Schools, in particular are faced with a language challenge not only coming from new migrant intake but also from poor communication skills by pupils who may come from disadvantaged backgrounds and are therefore twice as likely to leave school early than those pupils who come from wealthy backgrounds.In response to the increased importance being placed on developing innovative ways to ensure that all children can communicate and express themselves, this project aims to develop innovative ways to use visual literacy in teaching in early years and progressing through primary education. There is a clear understanding of visual literacy as part or a comprehensive communication education (at all levels), therefore, our project primarily aims: * to address the challenge to increase key competences for children in order for them to fully participate in and contribute to society, by developing a robust and tangible methodology that employs methods to support development of basic skills through the use of visual communication/literacy techniques * to equip teaching and non-teaching staff with a range of skills, key principles and relevant methodologies to integrate and support communication through the use of visual literacy techniques and tools* to develop a set of training materials and best practice teaching activities which will support a wide range of settings across Europe and support integration of those coming form disadvantaged backgrounds.The project ultimately aims to develop applicable and teachable skills and materials which  build on sound principles of visual communication and literacy. Specifically it focuses on the use  of storytelling, digital narratives techniques, use of art and media and the outdoor to develop creative strategies for integrating all children especially those coming from a disadvantaged background .The project is to be carried out by a mixture of schools, pre-schools centres, association and a training provider all of which are based in 4 countries who have a key role in Europe especially in relation to the migrant and refugee situation for both incoming and outgoing migration.

But these systems can only achieve efficiencies of around 45 to 50%, pose safety risks as the use high voltages (5kV) and the magnetrons have a short lifespan requiring frequent replacement. Magnetron technology does not allow for the automatic adjustment of power level to match the load variations. These limitations have a huge cost to industrial microwave processes and there are calls for more efficient solutions.  Across Europe, microwaves consume over 9.6 TWh of electrical energy annually.\nF&M seeks to upscale its 200W solid state continuous wave microwave system to address these limitations. The 1kW gallium nitride based microwave system will save at least 25% on electricity consumption, operate at more than 70% efficiency, allow automatic adjustment of power level in response to load variations and significantly reduce equipment size. It will also provide increased lifespan eliminating the need for frequent and costly replacements.  With all these excellent features and performance advantages, our product also comes at a very competitive cost to the user which lies in the same range with the magnetron systems.\nSolid state microwave technology can be used in moisture meters, medical applications like RF-Surgery, and microwave ovens for the manufacture of electronic assemblies.

The purpose of this project is to promote digital learning across the boundaries of physical spaces, across curriculum subjects and across languages and cultures, to facilitate collaborative learning across national boundaries. Over three years we have adopted three 'learning across boundaries\u2019 themes:1. Technology Outdoors: bridging formal and informal learning by extending learning beyond traditional classroom spaces and supporting learners with disadvantaged backgrounds by managing transitions positively through collaborative outdoor learning experiences.2. Stem to SteAm: adding the Arts to the integrated study of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths creating inter-disciplinary challenge-based online learning resources.3. Technology Enabled CLIL: using curriculum contexts to teach language competencies and cultural sensitivity with aim of meeting the language needs of a diversity of learners, including learners for whom English is an additional language (EAL/EFL).ParticipantsOur target groups are lecturers in Higher Education Initial Teacher Training programmes, trainee primary teachers, in-service primary teachers, and primary-aged pupils across four European countries in order to demonstrate how the innovative use of technology can quickly influence the curriculum at a number of levels. We aim to approach our three themes in an aspirational way by involving local cultural institutions and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Aims The main aims are to:1. Develop a strategic partnership consisting of teacher educators, teachers, trainee teachers, school pupils and representatives from cultural institutions and SMEs, to explore how teacher education can accelerate innovation.2. Promote digital learning beyond boundaries across physical spaces, traditional curriculum subjects, and languages and cultures, and so have an impact on teaching and learning across school and university sectors.The partnership also aims to develop: -  a Digital Leader programme for teacher education institutions. -  the digital competences of participants across the project themes. -  eTwinning project materials based on the project themes in cross-national teams.  -  connectedness via face-to-face events based on the concept of Digital Playdates, linking educational and cultural institutions, and SMEs. -  a MOOC on each of the three themes, extending the scope of the project materialsMethodologyEach year will begin with a 5-day training event taking the form of a Digital Playdate initiating the development of the main yearly theme and sub-themes. Cross-national groups will leave with ideas for a methodology and lesson plans on their chosen sub-theme. They will then develop and test their ideas for two months, and document and share as eTwinning projects over the following two months. In April the groups will meet again for 5-days to refine methodology and ideas in preparation for a MOOC and the launch of eTwinning project kits.In May and June each country will host a Digital Playdate as a CPD event for local teachers, held in cultural institution and supported by an SME.Project outcomes will include:- MOOCs on the themes of Technology Outdoors, Stem to SteAm and Technology Enabled CLIL, each consisting of a reusable and remixable set of content materials and an ongoing online community of practice. - interdisciplinary eTwinning kits on the project themes uploaded to the eTwinning platform.- a series of international and local teacher CPD events in the form of Digital Playdates and one Super Playdate.- a Technology Outdoors set of eTwinning project kits designed to support learners from disadvantaged backgrounds during transitions by helping them to manage change in a positive way. - a Technology Enabled CLIL set of resources and eTwinning project kits designed to support learners from disadvantaged backgrounds with additional language needs.- a Stem to SteAm set of resources and eTwinning project kits promoting interdisciplinary learning - a Digital Leaders Programme promoting technology use and eTwinning in schools - a series of papers and journal articles based on data collected on the project themes.  Longer term benefits:To provide sustainability, the project activities are designed to enrich the capability and curricula of the partner HEIs, to promote international collaborative work by developing cross-sector communities of practice, and to develop active cooperation from cultural institutions and SMEs.", "http://www.standens.northants.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA201-022332_1"], [2017, "Language development through play and inclusion", "Standens Barn Primary School", 17344.0, 1, 1, "We are a British school and have 400 children in our school.  We are set in an urban context in the middle of England, within the town of Northampton. We have rapidly expanded over the last 5 years. Our school community has changed significantly in that time with our demographic changing from 5% of the children speaking English as an Additional Language to 35%. At the same time, the percentage of children from Minority Ethnic Groups has changed from 15% to over 50%.  This large increase is mainly from families coming in from European Countries. The number of children entitled to Free School Meals is above the national average. We have a very strong ethos based upon the core values of being Brave, Enthusiastic, Safe and Thoughtful. This forms part of our vision which is build upon and academic and social aims for each child in the school.\r\nWe believe that education is seen as relevant when it is delivered in an exciting and stimulating way.  We encourage children to be creative, to try out ideas and explore their learning.  We also believe that this is best achieved alongside the teaching of reading, writing and mathematical concepts in order for the children to have a good grasp of the basics. \r\nOur motto supports us with this work and the 'My Best, Your Best, Our Best' is about the children developing as individuals and together and we have a great team here to help your child do that. \r\nTherefore, our project is to further develop the  learning our children with EAL and SEND primarily and this will build in the effective strategies we already have in place as identified by Ofsted.  This is alongside the continued development of speaking and listening and reading and writing skills, ensuring that this development is rapid and leads to good outcomes for the children. \r\nThe project main objectives are:\r\nTo develop and enhance the early year provision\r\nTo develop an understanding of curricula in other country\r\nTo develop outdoor learning and specifically forest learning\r\nTo develop our SEN provision\r\nTo develop strategies for increasing literacy and language skills\r\nTo develop  links in Europe\r\nThe main activities chosen for this project are a number of structured training courses in Europe:\r\n- Understanding the Finnish Education System, Joensuu, Finland\r\n- Visual Narrative in teaching Literacy and Languages, Malaga, Spain\r\n- Teaching and Learning in Special Education: The Icelandic Perspective, Reykjavik, Iceland\r\n- Forest learning, Lidkoping and Vara, Sweden\r\n10 staff over 24 months will take part in these structured courses chosen on their role,within the school, motivation and ability to impact and change provision.\r\nThe outcomes we are looking for include the children improving their vocabulary, developing good learning learning behaviours such as language and thinking skills and those associated with the Prime areas of learning. In turn this will lead to a greater ability to  decode words and apply reading skills and using these to aid writing. We believe that this unique course opportunity will provide the relevant skills and knowledge to not only improve our current performance, but to enhance the vocabulary development of children with EAL primarily and all children in turn. \r\nCombining existing teaching approaches with those promoted through the Finnish model and through technologies course in Spain to enhance learning. This will then be further developed in Sweden  through the outdoor learning approaches and will enhance and develop the work we started in September 2016, from the training we had on play learning.  These outcomes will be shared by other teachers and course trainers and will support the children in developing positive learning behaviours that can be utilised as part of their life long learning.\r\nThis would involve staff and governors undertaking research into  the various education systems and using this overarching framework to understand how visual literacy, inclusive technologies and outdoor learning can all contribute to language acquisition.\r\nThrough the school blog and online community they would record their findings and then upon their return they would implement elements into their own practice as part of a piece of research to see if this helps us achieve the outcomes mentioned above. \r\nWe aim to create a collaborative research model so that information can be shared between schools and between countries, through the use of ICT and to build up an block of evidence that is researched based. Information can then be disseminated with other local schools.\r\nOur enhanced provision will impact on our school's teaching and learning in the future and will provide our children and communities with skills to better integrate and live in today's  multicultural society.", "http://www.standens.northants.sch.uk", "Standens Barn Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035500_coordinator"], [2015, "Integrating best practice from Europe to support and enhance the Discovery Learning programme", "Standens Barn Primary School", 4568.0, 1, 1, "Our project is to further develop our successfully introduced Discovery Learning, primarily in the  Early Years, so that the curriculum is based on the child's interests. This is alongside the continued development of speaking and listening and reading and writing skills, ensuring that this development is rapid and leads to good outcomes for the children. The outcomes we are looking for include the children staying focused on tasks, widening their vocabulary, decoding words and applying reading skills and using these to aid writing and writing with a wider vocabulary. We believe that this unique course opportunity will provide the relevant skills and knowledge to not only improve our current performance, but to enhance the Discovery Learning model with additional ideas and methods.\r\n\r\nCombining existing teaching approaches with those promoted through the Reggio model, and those that will be shared by other teachers and course trainers, will support the children indeveloping positive learning behaviours that can be utilised as part of their life long learning.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this project is that Discovery Learning is having a positive impact on the learning of the children and we want to develop this even further by looking at creative approached to teaching in the Early Years and including a focus on the Reggio practice.\r\n\r\nThis would involve 3 teachers undertaking research into creative approaches in the Early Years practice in Italy and through the school blog they would record their findings and then upon their return they would implement elements into their own practise as part of a piece of research to see if this helps us achieve the outcomes mentioned above. This is a structured training course that will be delivered through planned days by LEAP.\r\n\r\nFor the teachers to create a collaborative research model so that information can be shared between schools and between countries, through the use of ICT and to build up an block of evidence that is researched based.
