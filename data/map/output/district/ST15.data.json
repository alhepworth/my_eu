Improved energy efficiency within buildings is, therefore, a priority objective in enabling Europe to meet its Kyoto Protocol commitments. Whilst a desirable architectural feature enabling enhanced occupier comfort, windows are recognised as a key weak spot in the building envelope, resulting in heat losses during winter months due to inferior insulating properties, and excessive solar heat gain during summer months, resulting in energy-intensive air conditioning. Such window-related losses represent 10% of a building's energy consumption (4% of Europe\u2019s total energy use).\n\nWhilst super-insulating window designs are commercially available, more limited progress has been made towards cost-effective solar heat gain control (SHGC) technologies. Existing solutions are primarily based on low-cost tinted films that permanently block a proportion of light entering the room (leading to room darkening and negative energy efficiency during winter months). Whilst dynamic (switchable) films have been developed, such materials demonstrate either inferior properties or are cost prohibitive.\n\nIntegrating emerging materials science with a cost-efficient polymer-extrusion process, the SOLARGAIN project will develop an innovative low-cost all-polymeric switchable reflective SHGC film. The film will enable dynamic optical properties in response to the changing lighting, heating and cooling needs of the room, and thus improved natural lighting, occupier comfort and enhanced energy efficiency. The SHGC films will be incorporated within:\n\n\u2022 A highly-insulated sealed-window-unit design targeting > 90% window-related energy saving\n\u2022 A retrofit window-film structure targeting > 90% energy savings associated with room cooling\n\nThe window systems will integrate photovoltaic and sensor technologies, thereby enabling self-powering and intelligent activation. Achieving cost competitiveness with existing window systems, the SOLARGAIN technology will also demonstrate significant long-term cost savings through enhanced energy efficiency.

The medical implant industry is a part of the medical device market generates about \u20ac2.4 Bn in Europe and \u20ac1.5 Bn in the USA in 2008 and has an estimated annual growth of 10% per year, largely attributed to the aging population in the developed countries. Internal fixation devices market is an estimated \u20ac980 Mn in EU25. The total cost of treatment is much higher due the cost of removing the fixation devices, an estimated \u20ac3.4 Bn per year in EU25. The idea of FracFix is to develop a fixation system that can be painlessly and easily removed at exact desired moment without surgery and general anaesthesia. During the project a fixator in nano-polymer composite with melting temperature below 50\u00baC and solid at 41.5 \u00baC, will be developed to use as the construction material for standard internal fixation parts, as well as an external unit able to melt the material so it can be removed through a 10mm hole in the skin. Internal fixation hardware removal results in high costs for the hospitals and risks and discomfort for the patrient.

This wil significantly increase conveyor hygiene in the foodstuff sector and especially so in the meat- and poultry-industry. The hygienic goals will be achived by designing the system based in hygienic design guidelines and by developing a new, superior belt material which combines with an automated cleaning system for significant increases in hygiene and foodsafety. The belt will see improvements to state-of-the-art in impact and cut resistance and at least 50% improved durability and antifouling properties as compared to conventional belts. Furthermore the developed system will focus on decreasing use of energy, water and detergents by innovations in selected conveyor components: optimized drum motor design and an automated transportable cleaning system (CIP system).  The market opportunity for the SME consortium - group of European suppliers  of conveying solutions and components to the conveying industry - lies in the provision of a new and hygenicaly optimized conveying system and its components making for a product that is significantly better than the state-of-art solutions currently avaliable. The major innovation and point of market differentiation of the HYCON product will be considerably better hygiene and downtime in combination with reductions in use of energy, water and detergents, a combination not seen in current SOA conveying technology or products.  For the meat and poultry industry the developed system presents major benefits in terms of lowering the time needed for cleaning by up to 33% and the cost needed for this by 50%.
