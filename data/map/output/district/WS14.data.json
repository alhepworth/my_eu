The manner in which the project intends to contribute to such a wide policy challenge is by developing knowledgeable VET educators. We believe that if we will target VET educators (not aspiring event managers) we will be able to achieve better results and impact will be wider.  \r\n\r\nThe applicant has developed and piloted Event management programme and materials, and we now wish to share and improve the programme with the help of a network of European VET partners, working together towards achieving transparency and recognition of skills and qualifications to facilitate learning, employability and labour mobility.\r\n\r\nThe vast umbrella of event management includes an extensive repertoire of possible events, which include hospitality, retail and education. Many of these are familiar to most of us and recognisable in event listings at institutional, local, regional, national and international levels, such as: conferences and meetings, exhibitions and trade fairs, music festivals, arts and cultural events, sports events, etc.\r\n\r\nThe proposal builds on the UK approach to student-centred learning, offering an innovative pedagogical approach to partner nations. The event management programme for VET educators that we wish to develop, improve and standardise is based on an learner-centred approach, offering immediate solutions to engage employers in work-based learning. The curriculum materials will be offered for a VET training route, and opportunities for national and ECVET certification will be explored. \r\n\r\nThe tangible results of the project will also lead to the development of better quality assurance mechanisms in VET, by identifying clear statements of learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe project relies on four pillars: first, comparison of National occupational standards in 5 EU partner counties, where the partners will also assess the state of the art and will identify gaps. A second, in which partners  will be working on capacity building of VET educators in event management, through introducing innovative teaching methods and pedagogy. Lastly, conclusive output, where VET educators will be able to test their knowledge and skills by pilot teaching and portfolio building (for VET learners/aspiring event managers).Lastly, the tools and materials are shared as Open Educational Resources.\r\n\r\nWe will work together to bring in good/better practices, improve the materials of EM programme and standardise, with inputs from 10 partners representing 5 EU countries. We are all seeking to enhance the \u201cboost to employability\u201d through pilot teaching and portfolio building. We want to design the most appropriate VET teaching approach and pedagogy, using the knowledge of all the partners. We acknowledge the different pedagogical approaches of partners/nations, yet also seek to be uniform in our approach \r\n\r\nThe impact will be that we develop a common results (tangible/intangible)  which we all own \u2013 both as intellectual property and \u201cown\u201d in terms of our commitment to its quality delivery. The main target groups will be the VET educators and the staff of the partner organisations, which will benefit directly from the developments of the project. VET learners (aspiring event managers)  will be also targeted and will be involved in testing the VET educators acquired knowledge and skills through pilot teaching/portfolio building\r\n\r\nThe current proposal will build and strengthen a network of European VET providers, enabling them to deliver a standardised EM curriculum in VET, build organisational capacity and collaboratively work towards achieving results that tackle EU's 2020 Strategy.", null, "GECKO PROGRAMMES LIMITED", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA202-036615_9"]]}}}}
