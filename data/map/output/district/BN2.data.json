This method attempts to overcome well-known problems of other MT approaches, e.g. bilingual corpora compilation or creation of new rules per language pair. PRESEMT will address the issue of effectively managing multilingual content and is expected to suggest a language-independent machine-learning-based methodology.

It is intended to be of a hybrid nature, combining linguistic processing with the positive aspects of corpus-driven approaches, such as SMT and EBMT.In order for PRESEMT to be easily amenable to new language pairs, relatively inexpensive, readily available language resources as well as bilingual lexica will be used. The translation context will be modelled on phrases, as they have been proven to improve the translation quality. Phrases will be produced via a semi-automatic and language-independent process of morphological and syntactic analysis, removing the need of compatible NLP tools per language pair. Parallelisation of the main translation processes will be investigated in order to reach a fast, high-quality translation system. Furthermore, the optimisation and personalisation of the system parameters via automated processes (such as GAs or swarm intelligence) will be studied.

They will hear from destination marketers, entrepreneurs and family run enterprises about ways they use farm shops, food festivals and gastro-tourist itineraries to encourage an Icelandic Sense of Place, with greater awareness and understanding.  And they will learn from restaurants and chefs about the importance of sourcing and promoting local food menus.  Most importantly they will gain an appreciation of the growing desire for authentic local experiences and the role cuisine can play in that.

In 2009 Opera Circus began to develop a long term series of youth and school's exchanges, cultural and arts programmes between Dorset UK and the Srebrenica region. Participants from these communities realised that they had many of the same problems. High youth unemployment, 67% in Srebrenica, 27% in Dorset, very low wages when jobs were found, no higher educational facilities nearby, difficulty in finding somewhere to live in the same area due to cost and a sense of isolation from the rest of the world due to living in semi rural and rural environments. Young people in these communities can also suffer from high levels of abuse, poverty, crime, drug and alcohol related problems.  In Srebrenica, there is the hangover from the genocide and high levels of PTSD.  As a result of this need a number of partners in the UK began to develop projects together with partners through the work of Opera Circus in the Balkan region.  One of the projects was, Simply Human, the final event in the highly successful EU Cultural Project Wake Up. http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2012/05/08/simply-human-success-750000-heard-about-us/  This led to a number of other youth projects both in Srebrenica and Dorset including http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2013/04/02/like-a-film-in-my-mind-youth-in-action-programme/ and a youth in action job shadowing programme linking youth centres.  As a result of this learning process along with the current economic and political climate in Europe, Opera Circus suggested to the partners and participants, a new programme of work. \r\nThe Complete Freedom of Truth - Youth Theatre and the Creative Arts, is a long term process designed to use cultural and arts activities to provide skills training and cultural awareness for young people by developing their own creativity. The project aims to raise consciousness and encourage a vision of an equal, inclusive and truly democratic society.  The project will be led through a process of youth exchanges and youth workers mobility and with non formal learning at its heart. Combining the highest quality of cultural and arts practice, inspired and facilitated by highly gifted and experienced partners, practitioners and artists, will lead to the establishment of an international network of socially engaged young cultural leaders and organisations with last-long impact locally, nationally and internationally.  \r\nAs well as 6 extraordinary European partners, we have also invited 5 UK organisations to take part in TCFT phase 2. The UK has a reputation for being highly advanced in influencing inclusion, social disadvantage and disability through non formal cultural and arts activities and we are keen to share the UK experience with our partners and to learn from them. There are 12 partner organisations in total raging from youth centres, youth theatre groups, a university, leading international cultural organisations, a city and local authorities making TCFT a unique, exciting and robust melting pot of expertise, knowledge and disciplines. TCFT will work directly with 180 young people, 24 group leaders and 48 youth workers over the 24 months period in a combination face-to-face meetings and ongoing online training.  Young people involved in the project are socially disadvantaged and TCFT will work directly with at least 70 disabled young people. The numbers above reflect the individuals engaging directly with the project, many more will be impacted via the work of partners, youth workers and young people locally.

However, IUC are vulnerable to infection, undermining their utility, jeopardising patient welfare and posing a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems. Over 40% of CAUTIs may be attributed to P. mirabilis, which poses particular problems in the care of catheterised patients. P. mirabilis causes encrustation and blockage of catheters, leading to serious complications such as pyelonephritis, septicaemia and shock. It is difficult to eliminate from the catheterised urinary tract, even after the catheter is removed, and often causes chronic infection recalcitrant to conventional antibiotic therapy.

Significant advances in treating coronary artery disease have been made over the last decade with the introduction of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI involves the placement of stents within narrowed arteries relieving the symptoms of angina and in some cases increasing life expectancy. The two major problems with currently available stent designs are restenosis and late thrombosis. The former is more common in uncoated stents and was addressed with the introduction of drug releasing stents. However, concerns have been raised about the increased incidence of stent thrombosis with these drug releasing stents. An innovative design of stent utilising titanium oxynitride (Titan 2) was the first of the bioactive stents which compared favourably in efficacy to the drug coated stents but with less re-narrowing than with the uncoated stents. The Titan 2 uses the fundamental biocompatibility of titanium to reduce inflammation and promote healing after stenting. Nitrous oxide (NO) is an important regulator of endothelial cell function. We will design a bioactive titanium oxynitride coated stent which will release NO after stent implantation.

Current treatment options for brain cancer are limited with patients having a poor prognosis. One of the major hurdles is the BBB which prevents effective doses of drugs reaching the site of disease. There is thus a major need for technologies that can successfully overcome such a hurdle without having a negative effect on safety and tolerability. Pharmidex have developed a drug delivery system that transiently and reversibly opens the BBB to entry of compounds into the brain without inducing tissue injury. It is based on patented lipid-like structures and has been shown to deliver both small molecules and large proteins effectively into the brain. The lead delivery compound for brain cancer appears to be safe and well tolerated on the basis of pre-clinical testing. We initially seek to determine the mechanism of action of the technology for penetrating the BBB; application to different therapeutic agents as well as development of reliable brain cancer animal models to quantify efficacy of nanoparticle-based therapy using imaging technology. We believe this novel delivery technology will be a unique drug discovery tool with the potential to enhance efficacy of established agents, reduce systemic exposure of the chemotherapeutic agent, thus minimising both the on/off-target toxicity through enhancement of drug absorption at the target site.

To be able to change we need to understand, both our selves and the society that we live in. To be able to understand we need to share stories, opinions, feelings and facts, we need to meet at a common ground where curiosity and creativity are our weapon of choice and all prejudice is left at the door. \r\n\r\nThe third day we will sum up everything we have discussed and explored. The croups will be stimulated to make a short video about empathy inspired from the discussion. The format is free, that is if one use animation, clip art, claymation or do a performance.

Dopamine is currently the most widely used first line drug. In neonates, sustained hypotension may, and impaired organ perfusion will, cause brain injury and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes.

No reliable safety or efficacy data exists for the use of these drugs in neonates or newborns.  Furthermore, no uniform criteria exist to define hypotension and there is little evidence to support current intervention strategies, which vary widely.  Recently, superior vena cava (SVC) flow has been proposed as a more reliable indicator of circulatory failure than low blood pressure and preliminary results suggest Dobutamine is the optimum therapeutic in such cases. NEO-CIRC proposes 1) a randomised placebo controlled trial to provide safety and efficacy data for Dobutamine as a first line inotrope for all gestational ages 2) to perform pre-clinical; pharmacokinetic; pharmacodynamic; metabolomic and pharmacogenomic studies 3) to develop improved biomarkers of hypotension 4) to develop and adapt a formulation of Dobutamine suitable for newborns with the aim to apply for a Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation.

Significant advances in treating coronary artery disease have been made over the last decade with the introduction of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI involves the placement of stents within narrowed arteries relieving the symptoms of angina and in some cases increasing life expectancy. The two major problems with currently available stent designs are restenosis and late thrombosis. The former is more common in uncoated stents and was addressed with the introduction of drug releasing stents. However, concerns have been raised about the increased incidence of stent thrombosis with these drug releasing stents. An innovative design of stent utilising titanium oxynitride (Titan 2) was the first of the bioactive stents which compared favourably in efficacy to the drug coated stents but with less re-narrowing than with the uncoated stents. The Titan 2 uses the fundamental biocompatibility of titanium to reduce inflammation and promote healing after stenting. Nitrous oxide (NO) is an important regulator of endothelial cell function. We will design a bioactive titanium oxynitride coated stent which will release NO after stent implantation. It is proposed that this will have beneficial effects to endothelial function after stenting and possibly reduce the incidence of re-narrowing and stent thrombosis. The new metal stent will be tested in vitro using primary human monocytes and platelets and using a human derived endothelial cell line. We aim to achieve excellent biomaterial properties as applied to coronary artery stenting, a highly biocompatible surface and to demonstrate release of NO after stent deployment. To achieve this we will combine the knowledge of our industrial, medical and scientific partners to develop a new coronary stent which will be of significant benefit to patients with coronary artery disease both in the European Union and worldwide.", 237847.0, 824957.0, 2, 3, "DONOR CARD", null, "http://www.bsuh.nhs.uk", null, "fp7_97409_999879396"], [1204329600000, 1330473600000, "Monolithic Adsorbent Columns for Extracorporeal Medical Devices and Bioseparations", "Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Nhs Trust", "The aim of the project is to manufacture novel composite 3D monolithic adsorbent columns for use in extracorporeal medical devices for blood purification (haemoperfusion), therapeutic apheresis and cytapheresis and in bioseparations for analytical and commercial applications.
