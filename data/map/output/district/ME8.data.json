It includes a strategic school partnership which comprises a German, a Spanish and an English School. In their profiles all three schools put an emphasis on the advancement of foreign languages, deriving from that emphasis the respective conditions in the schools facilitate the successful realisation of the intended project.The demand to improve foreign language teaching has been asserted by teachers of all three schools. The teachers have especially criticised the missing authentic character in the learning of foreign languages and also that the lessons are normally not product-oriented. They attribute the decreasing learning success to this situation. These assumptions have been confirmed by observations and enquiries made by the teachers; as a consequence a counter-action seems necessary.The encouragement of the basic skills (reading and writing) in foreign language teaching and the advancement of the digital capabilities are determined as the ultimate ambition of the project. Within the duration of the project the participants are supposed to create (in history and foreign language lessons) three different project elaborations each with a historical focus. The results have to be composed in the languages: German, English and Spanish. The three European schools will be cross-linked by eTwinning, which will be used as a basis in order to guarantee a continuous exchange of all the involved institutions and of the project participants. This exchange will be implemented in the daily lessons. The establishment of TwinSpace can support the organisation of these lessons by facilitating a direct international communication of the partner schools. Furthermore, the realisation of different open forms of lessons should provide for an improvement of the learning success in the foreign languages and for an increase in the motivation of the pupils to learn foreign languages. The reflection of the lessons and the exchange of information about the observations of all participants is an important component of the project. The project will be evaluated at scheduled regular intervals in order to guarantee a quality assurance.In addition to the project elaboration the participating teachers will work out a project guideline in which they will compile and reflect all materials and methods used in the project. This guideline will also serve as a documentation of the project and it should be a basis for subsequent similar projects and a helpful assistance in carrying them into execution. This is one of the most important sustainable benefits of the project. In three project meetings the respective project results are to by summed up synergistically and are to be presented in front of the particular school communities. In this connection all participants in the project should also evaluate the project on the strength of their experience to date. The further processing and advancement of the intended project guideline will be incorporated into these meetings. The project management, the time management and the budget monitoring will be planned and guaranteed by all participants in equal measure. The impact of the project refers to the persons directly involved in the project and to the group of people and the institutions and organisations which can be reached by the presentations of the project results.", "http://www.thehowardschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE03-KA219-022961_2"]]}}, "0SA": {"cordis": {"data": [[1320105600000, 1414713600000, "(Generating simulations to Enable Testing of Alternative routes to improve WAYinding in evacuation of over-ground and underground terminals)", "HOCHIKI EUROPE (U.K.) Ltd", "Efficient evacuation from transport terminals is usually constrained by a lack of detailed knowledge of the geometry.  In most cases, the population attempts to evacuate via the way they entered, bypassing or ignoring emergency exits.  In serious fires, the inability to locate emergency exits can lead to loss of life as in the Kings Cross Underground Station (1988) and D\u00fcsseldorf airport (1996) fires. While terminal staff attempt to direct passengers to the most appropriate exits, they cannot be everywhere throughout the station and they may not be able to reach the population quickly enough.  Throughout the world, emergency signage has traditionally been used to address this problem.  However, recent research has shown that only 38% of people \u2018see\u2019 evacuation signage, even if the sign is located directly in front of them and their vision is unobstructed.  GETAWAY will tackle this problem through the design and development of an Intelligent Active Dynamic Signage System (IADSS).  Through the introduction of lit, flashing and running signs, the traditional static emergency sign will transformed into a Dynamic Signage System.  The increased affordance offered by the DSS will significantly increase the detectability of the emergency exit sign.  By linking the DSS to the alarm system, the DSS will only be activated when needed, thereby overcoming the \u2018learnt irrelevance\u2019 of emergency signs.  Finally, the Active Dynamic Signage System will be linked to an automated system utilising evacuation simulation, CCTV footage and Fire Detection System information to determine the optimal evacuation route as the fire develops, bringing Intelligence to the ADSS.  IADSS enables the terminal Incident Manager to direct passengers to the optimal egress route by activating the appropriate signs within the ADSS.  The IADSS will be tested and validated through trials in the London Underground and Barcelona Metro.  GETAWAY will bring the humble emergency exit sign into the 21st Century.", 83908.0, 2571167.0, 4, 9, "GETAWAY", "http://www.getaway-project.eu/", "http://www.hochikieurope.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/144001.jpg", "fp7_100354_967406415"]]}}}}
