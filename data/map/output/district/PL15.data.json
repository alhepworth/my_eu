A Healthy Mind For A Modern World brings together current thinking about teaching pedagogies from different European schools as a way to tackle these issues in a holistic way.  The project aims to combine best practice from Swedish schools in relation to how Forest school can be used to improve emotional wellbeing as well as best practice from Cornish schools in how critical thinking can support pupils in developing their own sense of self.   This will be compared to how schools in Slovenia use music and dance to integrate pupils from disparate social and ethnic backgrounds.  \r\n\r\nThe aims are to share these best practices across the partner schools from Sweden, Slovenia, and UK.  3 members of staff from each partner school will observe best practice in their partner school.  From these visits, educational activities will be organised in the partner schools that will use elements from Forest school, critical thinking as well as the arts to deal with issues of social cohesion and academic attainment.   From this initial meetings, the benefits will be felt by the pupils across all the partner schools - namely some 2,000 students in total.  \r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits will be that these pedagogies will become more widely known not only in the partner schools but in the schools in the local area.  It is hoped that the materials produced by the project - a booklet of teaching ideas and a video to be uploaded on Youtube - will also help to inspire all teachers and teaching staff on how they can improve the outcomes for their pupils through the use of Forest schools and critical thinking.", "http://lewannick.cornwall.sch.uk", "Lewannick Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036697_coordinator"]]}}, "8HD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Kernow-Breizh : un \u00e9change international de jeunes au service de la revitalisation de 2 langues minoritaires celtiques, le breton et le cornique", "Kowethas An Yeth Kernewek", 9855.0, 2, 2, "Kernow-Breizh : an international youth exchange to revitalise two minority languages, breton and cornish.It is proposed to organise a youth exchange of some 10 days between young Breton speakers from Brittany (schooled in bilingual Breton-French systems) and young Cornish who know only a little of their own regional language (the movement to re-envigorate Cornish is more recent that the re-invigoration of Breton). This exchange will involve 24 young people of 13-16 years (12 Bretons and !2 Cornish) and 4 supervising adults (2 from the Breton association UPABAR and 2 from the Cornish association Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek).

This project aims to develop the linguistic and intercultural competencies of the young people, to stimulate the interest of the young people in their own regional culture and language, to spark their curiosity towards a 'sister' language, to develop educational skills in the young people (learn to design and organise cultural discovery workshops, be role models for the other young people) and encourage the creation of friendship links and openness towards Europe.To achieve these objectives, the organising team will build upon exchange activities designed and organised by the young people, team building activities, activities to discover the culture and heritage of Cornwall as well as during the daily tasks and informal times.The principal impact expected is an evolution of the image that the young people have of their own regional language; enjoyment in speaking it and demonstrating it to others, a wish to learn more (Cornish side), the use of it as a means of international exchange, understanding of the future of the minority languages... The young people must feel involved in an important local community, as well as understand that promoting and defending regional languages are very much at stake on  the European level.This contributes to the global ambition for the repossession of regional languages by the younger generations, along with their learning of European citizenship, in the respect and knowledge of cultural diversity.

This business will include between 10-15 students who will take on different roles depending on their interests and qualities. Each company will be led by a managing director. Initially the students will learn about different types of businesses, aims and objectives and business ethics. The meetings in the partner countries will provide help and expertise in the different aspects of their plan (using the help and support of fellow students, teachers and business people).

With this project, with the contact with European realities, it is hoped to be able to stimulate the students to the importance of technical training as a way to improve the competences for the labor market and give them a broader view of their knowledge and professional skills.\r\nSpecific project objectives, relatively to the students, are: reduce early school leaving; improving the employability of students in the area of formation; give students a modern and European view of the activities in their area of formation; and improve their language skills. With the involvement of teachers and operational assistants, they are expected to acquire new skills, particularly in collaborative work that will allow them to improve their interdisciplinary abilities and work capacity and integrate the activities of the technical sector of the school.
