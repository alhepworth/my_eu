To ensure maximum impact, the TURaS project has developed an innovative twinning approach bringing together decision makers in local authorities with SMEs and academics to ensure meaningful results and real change are implemented over the duration of the project.  11 local authorities or local development agencies are involved as partners in the project and they will orient research and development from the outset towards the priority sustainability and resilience challenges facing their cities. 9 leading academic research institutions and 6 SMEs will work with these cities helping them to reduce their urban ecological footprint through proposing new visions, feasiblity strategies, spatial scenarios and guidance tools to help cities address these challenges. The specific challenges addressed in TURaS include: climate change adaptation and mitigation; natural resource shortage and unprecedented urban growth.\nOver the five year duration of the project, the feasibility of these new approaches will be tested in selected case study neighbourhoods and new measures to enable adaptive governance, collaborative decision-making, and behavioural change towards resilient and sustainable European cities will be tested. The impact of these new approaches will be measured and results compared between participating cities before a final set of strategies and tools will be developed for demonstration, dissemination and exploitation in other European cities.

The salient scope of the proposal is the enabling of knowledge and understanding of freight distribution and service trips by providing guidance for implementing effective and sustainable policies and measures. This guidance will support the choice of the most optimal and applicable solutions for urban freight and service transport, and will facilitate stakeholder collaboration and the development, field testing and transfer of best governance and business models. \nThis shall be achieved through:\n- The targeted understanding of urban freight and service trips, fostered by data collection on city logistics;\n- Field testing and implementation of representative city logistics measures;\n- The development and application of a modular, integrated, evaluation framework for the assessment of these measures;\n- The development of a typology between cities and potential city logistics components; and \n- The provision of guidance to cities, shaping consistent implementation channels for successful solutions, all according to the local needs and constraints. \nThese activities will be accompanied by the production of practical tools that could support the take-up impact of NOVELOG project to wider international city and industrial networks and beyond the project's lifetime.

Various strategies have been proposed in order to achieve these games, e.g. more support for employees in transitions, special offers for the unskilled, validation of knowledge acquired in informal situations and encouragement of women. \r\n\r\nAll over the world it is mostly women who interrupt their vocational career in order to care for their children and family. After this career break many women find it difficult to find a new job because their knowledge is not up to date anymore; processes have changed and technologies have advanced. When finally reentering the workforce most of these women have to face the gender wage gap and discriminated against whenever it comes to promotions.\r\n\r\nThe project restart 2.0 aims to facilitate the way back into the work force for women after maternity leave. In summary it will provide an online platform containing different content, e.g. Microsoft Office courses, management knowledge, an English course and the pass of competences, a tool developed to document the knowledge women acquired during their time at home (e.g. time management, organizational skills). To contribute these skills to a European level and to fulfill the needs of the labor market, we developed the module \u201cintercultural competence\u201d which facilitates international/European competences of methods, decision-making and responsibility. The module \u201cServices\u201c completes the platform with support for questions about childcare and child support. Thanks to the platform the women can prepare for their return while still at home. They can autonomously organize their lesson which makes the program suitable for women with small children or other duties. All Modules of the platform are using low-level educational rudiments and methods with the ambition to provide a transparent learning-environment for un- and low-skilled women and therefor reaches the public at large. All modules correlate to the situation of women re-entering the job market to foster the virtual mobility, which is the basis of our information society, all offers of the project are optimized for mobile usage. The platform features an innovative open interactive module called \u201cWiki-Fem-Professional\u201d, which will be integrated into the platform and offers the following capabilities:\r\n\r\n- Free access to all interested parties in Europe (woman re-entering the job-market, working woman, woman in parental leave\u2026)\r\n\r\n- The possibility of entering job- or software-related information and learning content for all interested parties, following the example of online-lexica like \u201cWikipedia\u201d\r\n\r\n- The possibility of subject-specific on- and offline communication for all interested parties, following the example of social media\r\n\r\nTherefor Wiki-Fem-Professional is a unique European platform for women re-entering the job market and working women, which will be enhanced continuously by the attendance\u2018s input and provides job-related solutions European-wide. Owing to the open and free access the usage is open to the public at large and therefore provides information about the situation in the different European countries (Competences, problems of women re-entering the job, needs of the employers,\u2026). This means not only for the participants an additional benefit, it also provides information for political decisions to improve the perspectives of returning. \r\n\r\nTherefor and because of the interactive European-wide and long-term advantage after the projects end, and through the wide spread of the content, the project meets the demand of sustainability in a special way.\r\n\r\nThe project will be run by the European partners United Kingdom, Italy, Croatia, the Netherlands and Germany, who all have longtime experiences in vocational assistance and training of women.
