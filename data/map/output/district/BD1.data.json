Aside from the social costs in terms of suffering, they account for 70% on European average of public healthcare systems in the EU. A plethora of ICT based applications have been developed in the last years, allowing to tackle at least partially problems related to specific pathologies. However, even advanced experiences have had limited impact, mostly focusing on pilot applications entailing little or no change on the whole healthcare system. The RICHARD project arises from the need to make healthcare systems more efficient while managing effectively their costs. ICT can be a major change agent in this process, but only if systemic aspects are duly taken into account, such as the interrelation of ICT with organisational and non-technological components of healthcare systems. To do so, a significant shift is necessary to evolve from an application based model, to a comprehensive and sustainable chronic care model, likely to be adapted to the broadest possible range of chronic conditions. The RICHARD project will therefore focus its analysis on the pathologies-specific ICT applications being implemented in leading European regions and elaborate a Joint Action Plan oriented to the integration of those technologies for the deployment of sustainable chronic care models for European regions. This will require a strong coordination of research resources and innovation stakeholders (clearly identified in the first phase of the project) to design new research paths and innovation models. The Joint Action Plan will also be inspired by a medium-long term vision that looks at e-health services into a perspective of economic growth for the regions along the principles of open competition for better and pan-European healthcare services.

Among them, freight carriers and shippers are interested in minimizing freight logistics costs in order to maximize their profits, while maintaining a competitive level of service to their customers. City administrators and residents are oriented towards a decrease in traffic congestion, social costs and environmental nuisances, even though they are often direct beneficiaries of high quality delivery services. This leads to a multitude of differing and possibly conflicting objectives that are involved in urban freight transport planning and decision making, yielding a high level of complexity. This provides a main motivation for the development of tools for helping decision makers to reach higher grades of efficiency. \nDespite growing academic interest, the extent to which freight transport is acknowledged and formally considered in local authority transport planning varies considerably from country to country, and on a more local level, between towns and cities. As a result, policy development with respect to urban freight and city logistics is characterised by a rather fragmented approach, with many city authorities finding it difficult to address the complex set of differing views of a large variety of stakeholders. \nThe proposed project will be aimed at identifying local authority planning needs with regards to urban/city logistics activities and the necessary pre-requisites for inclusion of stakeholders in the process.

Because of these factors, they are learners, either in non-formal or informal learning situations.  They acquire skills and knowledge both through their radio practices and also on the various subjects they present or work on. These skills are not sufficiently recognized and validated, so that when they leave the radio, it is as if these skills were not taken seriously enough to be taken into account when applying for a job or for community service work in the world of media, communication, and information or other jobs or fields, whether near their community or far in other parts of Europe. Community radios in Europe have developed a European Job Skills Portfolio for these volunteers, to be published in 2014. Volunteers will be able to indicate their acquired skills, which will have to be certified and signed off by station managers to reinforce the credibility of the portfolio.

If community radios are characterized by their statutes and their attachment to certain values (respect for human rights, diversity, access to freedom of speech in the media, particularly for minorities that often do not have such access), they are also quite diverse : in urban areas, suburbs, rural regions, dedicated more to entertainment or to cultural themes, targeting younger or older populations, an audience of general public or a specific community, with various musical programming styles, that have a listenership of millions or only hundreds, using obsolete or modern equipment, with an \u2018organic\u2019 organization structure or a highly-structured management, with teams of young people or mostly older, or intergenerational, supported and subsidized by their community and country or not at all, in diverse countries throughout Europe\u2026 The evaluation of professional skills that is carried out in such different contexts risks being totally subjective, and incomprehensible in other contexts or places.

These aims are driven by the fact that the number of people entering VET has dropped across Europe in recent years, a fact which is contributing to growing skills mismatches within European labour markets. Therefore, policy makers and VET practitioners have begun to realise that there is a need to challenge misconceptions around the reality of contemporary VET in order to help position this educational pathway as a \u2018first-choice\u2019 once more for young people. \r\n\r\nLevel Up looks to contribute to this work by building an interactive tool for use in guidance sessions with young people that draws clear parallels between the learning outcomes found within work-based VET and career development. In part this approach will begin to breakdown stereotypes around VET routes being a second choice to academic tertiary education, by highlighting that learning outcomes in VET are as varied and complex as those found in university courses etc. At the same, the link which the tool will draw between VET and the labour market will demonstrate to young people the value which training within the VET sector has on long-term career progression. \r\n\r\nGiven that young people nowadays are all digital natives, an innovative use of ICT is needed to maximise the impact of project activities. As a result, the project will take a game-based learning (GBL) approach to the development of its outputs. A VET-based game will be built which allows young people to simulate progression through the VET system, by drawing on scenarios based on the learning outcomes, levels etc. found within work-based VET. By designing the GBL platform around the principles of flow theory, the project will look to demonstrate the diverse and challenging nature of VET through a medium which is proven to add an engaging, innovative dimension to traditional educational guidance for young people. Indeed, the interactive, \u2018fun\u2019 nature of the GBL platform will guide and inform young people, increasing their motivations for considering VET pathways by disseminating its information and guidance through a medium more normally associated with leisure and free-time. \r\n\r\nTo capitalise on players\u2019 increased motivation around VET, and to further challenge misconceptions and stereotypes, each game level will also link into complementary content found within the project\u2019s online portal. Here, both young people and the guidance practitioners who work with them will be able to find regional, national and European information on the careers benefits of VET, Labour Market and Skills Information, and further guidance on training routes etc. This will provide game players and professionals with the hard data and further information needed to inform decisions around VET pathways, by showing the concrete long-term impact of gaining such skills.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that these outputs are of the highest quality, the project will carry out extensive research into the current state of both GBL and the promotion of VET within European careers guidance. This research will inform all project activities, as well as feeding into practical resources for careers professionals, to help them further develop their own skills and confidence in embedding innovative ICT tools, such as GBL resources, into their work.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the project will draw on several European level tools and resources in its development. This is because it is felt that an open, transnational approach to the promotion of VET is needed in order to offer effective resources that highlight the diverse training routes and career opportunities found across Europe. This includes the European Qualifications Framework, as well as practical labour market tools such as Europass and EURES. Such an approach will help the project produce universal resources, which demonstrate the demand and opportunities for people with vocational skills to build careers on the local, national and European level.\r\n\r\nLevel Up looks to create an impact on the quality of guidance provided to young people considering education options by developing resources which both engage learners and upskill the support staff who work alongside them. In terms of staff development, the LMSI resources and guides to digital tools produced by the project will help to improve the quality and standard of guidance, as staff feel more confident in both promoting VET and using digital tools in their work. Similarly, this increased staff engagement, coupled with the direct interaction with young people through the GBL platform, will in turn mean young people are making better informed decisions about their education and training.

Information: The main aim of this area of the online seminar is to enable the career practitioners to accelerate and facilitate the integration process in to the labor market and thus: support long-term unemployed to re-enter, help young people to get first access and to prepare the newcomers for a successful long-term integration. \r\n2. Social-communicative and intercultural competence: This part of the seminar supports counseling practitioners in getting aware of communication processes and cultural barriers and helps them to handle difficult cultural situations. Which are the most common cultural challenges a specific group has to face? How can the work of counseling practitioners be influenced by cultural barriers? How communication skills and styles influence motivation? How to detect cultural and social barriers? And how to overcome those barriers?  Social-communicative and intercultural competence is a key factor for working successfully with hard to reach people. \r\nThis area of the online course aims at providing counseling practitioners with the necessary sensitivity and awareness for their work with people from different backgrounds. They get enabled to act as mediators between different cultures and social groups, understanding the background, thinking and acting patterns of a person.\r\n3. Coaching skills & competences: \u201chard-to-reach groups\u201d of becoming & staying unemployed build a very heterogeneous group. Support is very demanding and challenging and must be provided very individually and often only be fulfilled by individual coaching. Therefore the training will be focusing on the development of coaching competences, especially technical-methodical competences: targeted restatements, identifying, listening, questioning, clarifying to help individuals shift their perspectives and thereby discover different approaches to achieve their goals\r\n4. Using e-Tools in counseling and communication processes: The training approach will use a set of e-Tools (online meeting tools, video-chat, video, social media, scheduling, self-reflection and self-assessment, online cooperation tools, etc. for the communication and counseling process. The tools are both learning tools and learning content. \r\nAll experiences and outcomes of the project will be compiled in an interactive eBook that will accessible and free to use (cc-license).", "http://www.aspire-igen.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA202-005177_4"], [2018, "Gender+: Governance and Benchmarking Tools for Gender Positive VET Provision", "ASPIRE IGEN GROUP LIMITED", 231660.0, 6, 6, "Gender+ looks to develop governance and benchmarking tools for use by VET professionals in order to understand and improve their current approach to gender inclusion. In recent years, there has been a growing acceptance of a range of gender identities across Europe. This is evident in developments such as the greater gender and sexual fluidity found within younger generations, who now accept and identify with a diverse range of different identities, as well as through high profile campaigns such as Time\u2019s Up and #metoo. Yet, despite this growing visibility, inequality still exists. For example, women remain overrepresented in low-paid jobs across Europe, whilst the unemployment rate amongst trans people is higher than the EU average. \r\n\r\nIssues around gender inclusion create a unique set of challenges for VET institutions. Their main target group for students is this younger, more gender fluid generation. Yet, at the same time, their existing facilities, approaches and courses have not always been designed to meet the needs of differing gender groups. Therefore, there is an emerging mismatch between student expectations and VET provision. This can be seen in the fact that minority gender groups remain underrepresented in VET, whilst certain courses also continue to split down traditional gender lines. Similarly, although examples of training to help VET organisations address these issues exist across Europe, this training normally takes a \u2018bottom up\u2019 approach focussing on one gender group. The problem with this approach is that it leaves VET professionals unsure as to how to develop services which are inclusive for the full range of different identities now engaging with their provisions.\r\n\r\nConsequently, Gender+ looks to develop a complementary \u2018top down\u2019 approach which allows VET institutions to fully understand how different gender identities fit into their services, and so develop approaches which are fully inclusive to all. This will be achieved by developing a series of governance and benchmarking resources which create a structured and supported approach to quality service design. Partners will first develop a Gender+ Charter which will set out the minimum requirements an organisation needs to conform to in order to consider its provisions gender positive. This will be achieved through desk and field research into current best practices and emergent trends across Europe. The Charter will then be used as the basis for an interactive digital benchmarking tool which VET practitioners will be able to use to assess their current services and then track their improvement. This will be achieved through incentivised guidance and support which will highlight how VET organisations can evidence and improve provisions to meet the Charter\u2019s minimum requirements. Each organisation\u2019s score against the Charter will form a \u2018Gender Footprint\u2019, with those organisations scoring highly awarded a Gender+ quality mark. The final project output has been designed with sustainability and long-term impact in mind, as partners will produce a skills profile and resources for the development of a Gender Champion role. Through this the project will demonstrate the value for VET organisations in dedicating permanent time and resource to gender issues, something which will also help the project\u2019s other tools continue to be used after Gender+ itself comes to an end.\r\n\r\nThroughout these activities the project will look to engage with VET leaders, HR managers, equality and diversity leads etc. from across Europe. This will be complemented by the involvement of gender advocacy groups and policy makers. Therefore, the project will produce highly transferable resources which will be able to be used in a variety of contexts across the continent. This will help Gender+ achieve a wide impact on the governance structures found across VET institutions, helping these organisations to become more welcoming and inclusive for a range of gender identities. This will see an improvement in the numbers of students from these groups engaging with VET services, helping to address the current underrepresentation of minority gender groups in VET. As a result, more people from within these groups will develop key employability skills, meaning that they are able to further their careers and become valuable members of the labour market, something which will ultimately improve social inclusion long-term across the countries involved.", "http://www.aspire-igen.com", "ASPIRE IGEN GROUP LIMITED", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-048039_coordinator"], [2015, "Experience For Training", "ASPIRE IGEN GROUP LIMITED", 197249.0, 6, 6, "The economic crisis continues to bring a range of widespread challenges: many people have lost or are losing their jobs, and youth unemployment is at record levels. Areas of existing deprivation are the most vulnerable to the risk of poverty and social exclusion: 16.4% of the European Union's population (approx 80 million people) live below the poverty threshold and Eurostat estimates that 23,815 million men and women in the EU-28 were unemployed in January 2015 (18,059 million in the eurozone). The category of people \"at risk of poverty\" has expanded in recent years, as it has outlined a kind of \"disadvantaged user\" presenting multi-problematic characteristics, not only economic but of a those different kind, such as social exclusion or re-integration, health, culture, etc. For this \"disadvantaged user\", traditional training, work placements and standard paths to employment are no longer an effective solution to integrating into the labour market - even if the person has potential for becoming a productive worker they may need specialist support to address wider barriers, such as support in confidence building, self-empowerment, rebuilding of social networks and relationships. \r\n\r\nAnother challenge of the economic crisis has been the re-distribution of funds towards countries with a deeper development gap (the so-called social security nets), leading to a progressive decrease in public funding and resources for education and training throughout Europe. Other sources and models of funding are thus fundamental to supporting training programmes, with a particular focus on non public funds, for example by strategically linking vocational training to industry. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the partners felt the requirements to enhance work-based learning paths to answer to the needs of these persons and their target groups, inspiring to the EFT model. One of the important aspects of the EFT model is that the training activity is intrinsically linked to a production activity, that generates the incomes: i.e. the EFT sells its products and services in a competitive market environment. The project aims to promote this first EFT experience and find a model that could be adapted to the project partners' different national contexts, in particular comparing the model with what already exists in each country and working in a first instance on the skills of the coaches and trainers that work with trainees on a day-today basis.\r\nThe main outputs of the project will be:\r\n- Work-based Learning Common Framework, with initial desk research on the state of art and a collection of good practices in each partner country;\r\n- Development of a Professional Skill Profile of coaches/trainers in work-based learning environments;\r\n- A joint staff training session for coaches in Italy (5 days) and 20 participants;\r\n- A final Project Report, that illustrates the Common Framework of Work-based Learning, the Professional Skills Profile, the results of the joint staff training session in Italy and the work-based learning methodology.\r\n- 4 multiplier events, organised at key points of project lifetime and the production of intellectual outputs (after completion of the guidelines, the Professional Skill Profile, the joint staff training in Italy and a final seminar in Turkey).\r\n\r\nThe EFT project targets three main groups: 1) partners\u2019 staff members, coaches/trainers who will participate in the joint staff training and be directly involved in implementing project activities; 2) trainees who will benefit from the improved skills and knowledge of coaches/trainers involved in the project; 3) project stakeholders (VET organisations, universities, public institutions involved in the sector, social enterprise networks and consortiums, private organisations, etc.) that are involved in all stages of project development, in dissemination events and exploitation of results. \r\nThe results of the project will be published on the project website, as well as on the Erasmus+ projects portal of European Commission, as well the mailing list of project stakeholders, created by collating all partners\u2019 contact details.

The partners's respective experiences confirm the conclusions of 2011\u2019s European study of the European Commission's JRC-IPTS research center on the potential of digital games for the empowerment and social inclusion of young people, groups at risk of social and economic exclusion. \r\n\r\nMain pedagogical advantages of the use of serious game are commonly considered to have impact on \"learner motivation, trial and error learning, taking into account differences in learning rhythms, stimulating pedagogical interactions between learners \"(Djaouti Damien, Serious games : advantages and limits, 2016). Edutainment limits would be the choice of relevant games, the lack of integration of this new approach into the work of the teacher, the constraints of accessibility, material and logistical.

Many work based learning models exist across Europe, including dual systems, \u2018alternance\u2019 systems, work experience placements, professional integration contracts, companies offering work based learning, social integration projects\u2026each country has developed its own initiatives, which are often very similar and complementary. \r\n\r\nAlthough on the ground it may appear that these systems work well, they entail more than just a simple link between training and the labour market. Developing training programmes in direct connection with the world of work requires a robust and tailored programme. It involves transferring knowledge, technical skills, professional attitudes, motivating a trainee to follow through to the end of the programme, ensuring long term employment prospects, helping them to overcome barriers to work and inclusion. \r\n\r\nOn this basis, our intention is to improve the competences and skills of trainers in work based learning by offering a space in which to share knowledge, know-how and tools in work based learning.

Guidance professionals must provide information and quality counselling to all target groups, especially to those who are furthest from training and employment. They work in a globalized economy, with a permanently changing European labour market that is in crisis, and where information technology and communication have grown extremely important. Information sources have multiplied, the number of guidance structures has increased, an so have the requests for counselling and support. At all levels professionals are asked to network and to be reactive in the implementation of training, employment and integration policies.

The strategy sets five strategic goals of which two are closely tied to the development and provision of lifelong guidance.The main objective of the Foundation Innove is to coordinate the lifelong learning development activities and implement the relevant programmes and projects and the EU structural aid in a targeted and efficient manner. Our mission is to  support the development of learners' life skills by creating and stimulating the learning environment and efficiently mediate European funds to organisations that implement educational, labour and social policies. The Agency for Lifelong Guidance act as Estonian Euroguidance (EG) Centre in Estonia, operates in the Innove with the aim to support guidance practitioners in promoting mobility and the European dimension within education and training and in the field of lifelong guidance. The Agency belongs to the Academia - a network of partners that have a long term experience in organizing international study visits for guidance practitioners - to support them to become familiar with relevant developments and trends in Europe in the field of lifelong guidance. To meet the needs of the changing labour market and clients the practitioners have to be aware of the current trends in globalized labour market and have experience in using modern and wide-ranging toolbox of methods. In addition, due to the fact -  there is no regular accredited basic training programmes offered to the career specialists in the public universities, it is essential to provide a consistent possibility of different high quality courses.The main goal of this project is to provide an opportunity for the specialists working in the field of lifelong guidance, to gain new experience and knowledge from other European countries and to disseminate best practices among other practitioners in Estonia. With this project we aim to improve the professional skills and knowledge of the practitioners and the quality of guidance services provided by them. The multinational study visit groups are of added value \u2013 this provides the opportunity to learn from several counties\u2019 practices all at once. Last but not least, all the other participants benefit also from Estonian experiences, shared by Estonian guidance specialists. It is also essential to raise the awareness of the practitioners about mobility as one possibility in lifelong learning. By providing this opportunity to the practitioners, they can have a personal mobility experience and this helps to better realise and promote the value of mobility to others. Besides that, the communication abilities and growth of professional network, along with improved language skills, can be seen as the benefit of this project.Main target group of this project are specialists working in the field of lifelong guidance. Our practitioners have various educational backgrounds; most of them are either psychologists, information specialists, youth workers or teachers. During the study visit in spring 2016 and 2017, thirty practitioners will be visiting their colleagues in different European countries. As the first step in implementing the project, we will launch a call for application among our target group. Based on the application, the selection procedure will be carried through, with the main criteria for successful applicants being working experience in the selected field, language skills and dissemination plans of the project results. There will be an information day organised for the participants, where they learn about practicalities, conditions and the project in general. Then we will sign contracts with the participants and carry on with practical arrangements. The participants have to prepare a personal development plan at least two weeks before the study visit, where they state both their personal goals and methods how to reach them along with planned dissemination activities. In the II quarter of 2017 and 2018, four-days study visits will take place. After the visits, all participants must fill in relevant feedback forms and reports, disseminate the results of this project. We will link the dissemination of the project with the training programme for guidance personnell in Innove and find most efficient and multiform dissemination plan, preferably in media, both at regional, national and international level.The promoter provides participants practical and logistical support during the whole project.

The main objectives of the project are : the acquisition of professional competences in the context of European LLguidance, the development of language and intercultural skills, the sharing of knowledge about education and training systems in Europe, and the promotion of the benefits of a mobility week in a hosting partner structure. These mobilities are based on the exchange of practices on common themes. In the end the end users will also benefit from the mobility of the guidance professionals.This project is proposed by a European partnership of institutions working in various and evolving contexts in the field of LL guidance. The catalogue offers mobility placements on transversal themes related to guidance. Guidance is at both  European and national level an important issue and a lever for achieving European goals concerning mobility, training and employment, above all for employment and education which are two of the five EU objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy.Participant ProfilesParticipants come from structures involved in LL guidance. Guidance professionals must provide information and quality counselling to all target groups, especially to those who are furthest from training and employment. They work in a globalized economy, with a permanently changing, European labour market that is in crisis, and where information technology and communication have grown extremely important. Information sources have multiplied, the number of guidance structures has increased, an so have the requests for counselling and support. At all levels professionals are asked to network and to be reactive in the implementation of training, employment and integration policies. If professionals need constantly updated information, they also raise questions regarding their identity, look for new ideas and feel the need to share and learn about other professionals. Methodology for the management of the projectThe partnership includes a European coordinator and national coordinators, hosting  and sending institutions in each partner country. Together they define the themes that will be developed in the placements. Each coordinator organizes the mobility placement(s) in his country, with hosting institutions that have expertise in counselling and guidance. The coordinator is responsible for the placements and the quality of their contents (information, exchange of best practices, placement periods, conviviality, evaluation). The coordinator also organizes the selection of the national professionals to be sent abraod.Expected results and impactsA Europass Mobility is given to each participant, describing the contents of the placement in terms of knowledge and skills. (professional and intercultural knowledge, exchange of best practices , initiation and implementation of professional networks, information on the European dimension of guidance, linguistic skills, knowledge in new tools, ... ).After the placement, the participant will become a multiplier of mobility. The participant will disseminate the results of the mobility experience with colleagues so that they can also benefit from the mobility and the Erasmus + activities .Through the sharing of innovative practices at a European level, the counselees of guidance professionals (youth, students and adults) will receive practical information, tips and counselling that take into account the European dimension and the benefits of the mobility experience.The results for the partnership are: a further development of transnational and national cooperation, and a strengthening of expertise in the field of guidance professionals' mobility.Potential long-term benefits- the development of the European dimension in guidance activities should benefit both the structures and their clients;- the implementation of new networks of professionals;- the development of new mobility projects. (multiplication and innovation)- the exchange and dissemination of innovative practices implemented in Europe should help to reduce drop-out in education and training; and finally- the promotion of mobility, especially among the most vulnerable populations, should enable them to enhance their skills and improve their employability.www.euroguidance.eu/academiawww.facebook.com/pages/Erasmus-Academia-Exchange-Programme/366004653571358", "http://www.aspire-igen.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-023777_14"], [2016, "Drop outs, integration och f\u00f6r\u00e4ldrasamverkan", "ASPIRE IGEN GROUP LIMITED", 12539.0, 10, 10, "Europe and Sweden are part of an ever changing world. The changes are manifold and fast. Our staff must constantly update their knowledge about the labor market, educational systems and society in general. Migration between continents and countries means new conditions and it puts pressure on various social institutions. The increasing impact of globalization emphasizes our need to be well informed about other countries' educational systems and labor markets as well as the cultural background of each individual we meet. This project will widen the perspectives of our employees by enabling them to meet colleagues from other European countries and exchange knowledge and experiences with them, as well as learning about methods and models used in other countries.   We live in a multicultural world and that increases the demand for a professional career guidance and counselling at a new level at an extent we have not experienced before. Our Career Guidance Centre needs to have a dialogue with other European guidance organizations and to visit them to learn about method development, tools for professional guidance of newly arrived foreign youths. Research show that parental engagement during the youth's school years dramatically decreases the risk of Drop-out from school and increases the chances the youth will graduate from school. The drop-out problem is considerable in Swedish schools and we want to look at how this is dealt with in other countries. Modern career guidance counselling learns from other countries' experience and also wants to increase the understanding for other countries - and our organization wants to be at the forefront. We want to open up the possibilities for international exchanges in our entire organization and learn from good examples which we can implement in our regular activities. Through the Exchanges we will have a clearer picture of how to meet the challenges we have identified, i.e. developing methods and tools to meet newly arrived pupils from other countries, working with parental guidance and the Drop-out problem. We plan to let twelve employees from the different departments of our organization have the possibility to study how the partners in the proposed project deal with what we have identified as our development areas. Our staff, i.e. career guidance counsellors, social pedagogues, youth officers and heads of unit, will all contribute their various sets of knowledge and professional experience. These professions cooperate closely with youths and Drop-outs \u2013 first and foremost with those who risk to Drop-out, but also with getting Drop-outs back to school. The guidance counsellors are well experienced in how to inform about upper secondary education and VET in classes, in smaller groups or individually. They help youths to plan their future and give the individual the tools to make strategic choices.The task of the heads of unit is to create the conditions for their staff to work in a professional way, i.a. by offering competence development of high quality, nationally as well as internationally. The heads of unit will also lead the proposed project, should it be approved. We will arrange preparatory meetings for the staff with a clear agenda on what should be studied during the visits and how the visits should be reported \u2013 all with the aim of implementing the experiences and the networking into the development plan of the organization. Written reports should be handed in, and oral reports be given to colleagues and heads of the organization on completing a study visit. All of this will contribute to the development plan of the organization. The Career Guidance Centre in Gothenburg is applying for this project in order to gain answers within some especially difficult problem areas, especially concerning integration and the Drop-out problem. The expected result is a more effective and sharp career guidance councelling for newly arrived young students, which will lead to better school results and fewer Drop-outs. This, in the end, will promote integration.", "http://www.aspire-igen.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-SE01-KA102-021955_5"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "ASPIRE IGEN GROUP LIMITED", 121505.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_45572"], [2017, "ASPIRE IGEN GROUP LIMITED", 86892.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_34711"], [2017, "ASPIRE IGEN GROUP LIMITED", 48034.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_36168"], [2017, "ASPIRE IGEN GROUP LIMITED", 416.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_72116"]]}}, "5AH": {"cordis": {"data": [[1483228800000, 1546214400000, "Services to enhance innovation management capacities of SMEs in England, Northern Ireland and Wales", "West and North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce and Industry", "A national service in support of recipients of the H2020 SME Instrument and for the improvement of innovation management in SMEs, with the purpose of more companies with growth potential achieving global scaling \n \nInnovation is a vital ingredient of growth and an important element of the future success of the UK.
