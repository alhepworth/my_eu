The addition of a European dimension will be a new and exciting way of reflecting on our own pedagogy and leadership. Therefore our project 'Building upon outstanding teaching and learning through a European dimension' aim:s to\r\n\r\nFurther develop the outstanding leadership through the scrutiny and evaluation of alternative approaches including a European perspective. \r\nExpand expertise and skills in professional development systems (e.g. induction, mentoring and coaching) in order to ensure achievement and attainment at an outstanding level. \r\nIncrease staff competencies in the early years through observation of pedagogy in a European context. \r\nDevelop partnerships within the European community in order to develop our children as global citizens.\r\nBuild competencies in the global curriculum learning from observation of other practises in Europe. \r\nEncourage staff to see the potential of European/Global learning not only on their own practise but also on that of the young people in our schools.\r\n\r\nWe will include a team of 4 staff who will take part in mobility activities. Such staff  include Senior leaders and early years  staff who have the ability to lead change in school.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet our goals, we have selected attendance at structured training courses abroad ad the main methodology for implementing changes. These are:\r\nLeadership in Education in Finland\r\nCreative teaching Approaches in Early Years and Pre-school Education in Italy.\r\nIn addition,  local activities will include:\r\nEvaluation and reflection on home practice in light of practise observed in the European settings. \r\nExplaining and sharing practise. \r\nQuestioning and disseminating information and feedback.\r\nDeveloping links for future partnership work.\r\nFormulating a bank of ideas to select from and try out within the home setting.\r\nThe project will be undertaken via a structured programme provider (LEAP).\r\nFindings will be fed back to a range of audiences including in-house staff, Governors, children and the staff of schools within the local cluster. \r\nThrough the Inspire Teaching Schools Alliance information will be cascaded to a broader network using a blog specifically set up for the purpose and face to face training offered to partner schools.\r\nThrough the school website parents will be informed of the impact of the visit.\r\n\r\nResults and impact:\r\nIncreased staff competence and confidence.\r\nStaff will evaluate and reflect on their own practice in light of the practise observed in the host countries and have increased capacity to affect positive change.\r\nThey will have their minds opened to new and different ways of impacting positively on teaching and learning within our setting.  \r\nStaff will develop their skills of explanation, questioning and dissemination of information.

The curriculum we offer is not merely academic, but embraces the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of all pupils.  We are fully committed to the sharing of good practice and collaboration between schools and local communities. We strongly believe in continuing professional development and striving to improve the curriculum for our pupils, our school family and local community.  To prepare our pupils to live and work in a global society we aim to develop European links.  Our project objectives are to:        - Include global learning links in our school curriculum map.        - Enhance teaching and learning through using a range of creative global teaching strategies.         - Enhance our I.T curriculum by including links to a global community through the use of blogging, email and ipads.         - Improve problem solving opportunities and outcomes in Mathematics        - Provide a wider range of cultural experiences for our pupils.The project with include 6 members of staff, Headteacher, experienced class teachers and Level 3 teaching assistants who have been selected to cover a range of experiences.  I have listed names of 4 of the members of staff, but due to possible staff changes this may need amending to include 2 more staff. Also the Headteacher and one teacher may attend both courses.To achieve our objectives, we have selected 2 training courses in two different countries.Participants will receive quality training from the Finish and Belgium Education system.  (Leadership in Education - Helsinki, Finland) and Mathematics in Flanders Belgium. This will include understanding of practices and policies; increasing competencies with own practice; improving management skills in order to operate within an international setting; sharing good practice and evaluating own practice in order to integrate new approaches; working collaboratively in developing plans. The methodology in carrying out this project is to widen staff's knowledge and experiences in teaching and learning in a global society by visiting European/international schools of excellence; inspiring and motivating staff in using a range of creative global teaching approaches; to be able to collaborate with teachers and educators from within Europe; to receive quality professional global training; to improve pupil outcomes in their social, moral and cultural understanding. We expect participants to be inspired and excited by receiving training from an excellent school in another country. The training will support their continuing professional development and give them confidence for their future training needs; improve their knowledge of other cultures; another language; I.T; problem solving in Maths; a range of teaching methods.A number of outcomes will be a direct result of this project:a better understanding of creative methodsincreased awareness of ICT toolscultural and up-to-date knowledge of various countries an increased awareness of the culture and languages of other countriesincreased level of understanding of teaching techniques and methodsenhanced teachers' confidence, enhanced understanding of educational systems in other countriesenhanced leadership skillsThe impact will be that our school will produce a creative and inspiring global curriculum with I.T links to a global community.We expect our pupils to be more confident in using other languages; extend their understanding of a range of other cultures; be more confident in using I.T to blog and communicate more effectively across the world; widen their experiences of problem solving across the curriculum.As our school collaborates within our community, cluster and teaching alliance, training may reach well over 300 teachers/educators and pupils from over 40 schools in Northamptonshire.  By creating a global curriculum we are positive that our staff and pupils will be confident to live, work and liaise within a global society.

Our role is to help them develop the skills needed to respond to advances in technology, changes in socio demographic and cultural contexts.  Our role plays an important part in breaking down barriers to learning and prevent violent radicalisation by promoting common European values, fostering social integration, enhancing intercultural understanding and a sense of belonging to a community.(ET 2020 framework, strategic objectives)\r\nIn response to the increased importance being placed on an understanding of how the development of higher level thinking skills as part of a comprehensive communication education (at all levels), our proposal aims to address the challenges :\r\n\r\n*to increase key competences for children in order for them to fully participate in and contribute to a multicultural society\r\n* to develop a robust and tangible methodology that employs methods to support development of basic skills through the use of inquiry based philosophy skills and  creating thinking techniques\r\n* to equip teaching and non-teaching staff with a range of skills, key principles and relevant methodologies.\r\nImproving literacy and language levels through participation in activities that further develops metacognition and critical thinking has been identified as a key to develop children\u2019s ability to question and to further develop their thinking and of the world around them. \r\nTherefore, 'Children As Philosophers'  aims to promote and offer an innovative methodology within the practice of philosophy with children that addresses specifically social inclusion. The interest towards this theme rises from the consideration that the practice of philosophy is a useful tool that supports the development of critical and social skills in children and teenagers, favouring the implementation of a new form of collective action, inspired by values as peaceful living, respect, dialogue and debate. Philosophy with children is also an important tool for developing strategies for peaceful conflict resolution, especially within a multicultural context. \r\n\r\nThe project is to be carried out by a mixture of 4 schools, a training provider, a local municipality, a foundation,  and a VHS (AE) all of which are based in  6 countries.

Elf School has had some experience in this kind of cooperative work between teachers and teacher assistants in order to help each child achieve their potential, especially in literacy, mathematics, science and foreign languages. However, when we look at how other European schools make use of this way of working with teacher assistants, we realize that there is still room for improvement and - after consultation with our teaching staff - we decided to embark on a project that can help our school become an example in this filed in the local community.Having had a very long working partnership with the Bliss Charity School in the UK, through two previous Comenius partnerships and bilateral projects that we organized outside of Comenius projects, we agreed that we can work together in order to develop our schools' efficiency in enhancing the role of teaching assistants in our schools, for the benefit of our students' personal development and academic success.The main objectives of the project are to increase leadership in the classroom, to improve the teachers' abilities to better respond to individual learners' needs and deal with their social and cultural diversity, to empower teachers to develop new and innovative teaching methods and approaches to learning, to improve the skills and competences of the school's managers, to strenghten our school's links with European partners and develop the European dimension in our schools.A number of 10 primary teachers and teacher assistants will take part in relevant  training courses (A1) and 2 members of the management will take part in a job shadowing visit (A2), in order to observe how the schools creates a framework for efficient cooperation between teachers and teacher assistants.  All the participants will take part in preparatory activities before the courses and the job shadowing week, and will also commit themselves to organizing dissemination activities after the course, in order to cascade the results of the project within their school and the larger community.The impact and results of the project will be relevant for all the teachers in our school, but especially for the learners, who will benefit from the new teaching methods and cooperation between teachers, and will be offered the best opportunities for personal development and achieving academic success.  New teachers will benefit from the mentoring activities carried out by the trained staff and the larger community will benefit from articles, seminars and workshops organized by Elf School in order to share new practices.As our school has been ahead of the national curriculum and its implementation in Romania - many features that Elf School offered learners from the inauguration of our school in 1995 have been introduced along the years in the national curriculum (such as ICT lessons, intensive foreign languages study, music education with specialist teachers), we hope that the results of this project will also be an inspiration to other schools and the norm in the Romanian educational system in the future years.", "http://www.bliss.northants.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-RO01-KA101-024283_1"], [2016, "Professional development of staff through European training", "The Bliss Charity School", 9969.0, 1, 1, "The Bliss Charity School is an independent aided state school in a rural setting.
