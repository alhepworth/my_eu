Finland, N. Ireland and England.  All children, teaching staff and support staff  from the  schools will take part in the project.    With growing obesity and lack of exercise in young people in our countries and living in a throw away society which consumes many of our natural resources, there is a need to address these with young children.  Our project  is about being fair to each other and taking care of our environment.  We would like the children to be aware of the responsibility for themselves, community and environment and encourage them to think critically, whilst maintaining fairness.  Our overall aim is that the knowledge and motivation gained in the Project will change the habits of the pupils and they will have a positive influence on their parents in having a healthier lifestyle for a more sustainable future. During the project we will make different products, do activities like singing, dancing and playing games with fairness always in mind.  In this way we want to show the importance of our topics and how it concerns everyone. Children will learn to appreciate the outdoor environment, manage risks and learn skills of resilience, perseverance, communication and teamwork.  Share ideas between schools of how we use the outdoors and compare and contrast the flora and fauna, resources of the different countries.We also will work on the ecological footprint of every child, family , school...   At the end of the project we will have an exhibition about our results.  We will send fair bears as reporters to every school to find out the habits in each country, concerning lifestyle, fairness and environmental issues. To evaluate the progress we will carry out a survey at the beginning and at the end of the project.", "http://www.gorranprimaryschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA219-016671_1"]]}}}}
