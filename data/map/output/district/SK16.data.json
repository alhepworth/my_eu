In conventional white decorative coatings, for example, the main contribution to scattering is the difference in refractive index between titanium dioxide pigment (n=2.7) and the continuous medium, the resin system (n\u22481.5). Titanium dioxide has one of the highest refractive indices known, and is certainly the most widely used white pigment, but in recent years the price of titanium dioxide has increased rapidly and there will be serious supply shortages in the foreseeable future.\nAt the same time, there is a growing awareness of sustainability and environmental issues in the chemical industry and particularly the coatings industry, and methodologies, such as life cycle analysis and carbon footprints, are being developed to quantify the \u2018environmental friendliness\u2019 of coatings\u2019 materials and products. Titanium dioxide pigment is one of the major contributors to a coating\u2019s carbon footprint and the manufacturing process for titanium dioxide produces unwanted waste products.\nAnother way of enhancing opacity in a white coating is the inclusion of air (n=1), which can improve the efficiency of titanium dioxide as an opacifier, air has environmental and cost benefits. The DRYFOAM project will develop novel opaque architectural coatings, based on a foam structure. It aims to develop stable and tough foam scaffolds within coatings, particularly for ceilings and interior walls, capable of withstanding normal wear and tear conditions. The European interior wall coatings market (including ceilings) was estimated in 2008 as 2.79 million tonnes (valued at \u20ac4.65 BN), more or less equally split between the professional decorating and the home (DIY) decorating market.", 198032.0, 1228774.0, 5, 9, "DRYFOAM", null, "http://www.lankem.eu", null, "fp7_106749_953440258"]]}}, "5AP": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Bringing internationalism to our school", "All Saints Catholic College", 41044.0, 1, 1, "All Saints College has been at the heart of our community for fifty years.  We are proud of our Christian tradition which provides us with deep roots and gospel values that the world is crying out for.  Our mission is to be a Catholic College where every individual is highly valued and where care and concern for others is central to our work.  \r\n\r\nWe are a school who is on an exciting and rapid school improvement journey.  Our school has been in special measures for the past 2 years and since then we have made significant changes to leadership and staffing.  We have received four highly positive OFSTED monitoring visits and special measures will be removed summer term 2018.\r\n\r\nThis is a new beginning for our school and we need to establish a new direction, build on the current positive attitudes of staff and pupils to make languages an integral part of our school\u2019s approach.\r\n\r\nWe participated in a previous small scale Erasmus+ project, involving two members of staff and focusing on developing Spanish. This project was very successful and resulted in much improved teaching and an excellent link being formed with a school in Spain which has led to pupil exchange visits.\r\n\r\nOur school is not very multi-cultural although our number of  EAL pupils on roll is increasing and with 15% EAL on roll (22% in year 7) and we think that it is crucial that our pupils have a more international outlook on the world.\r\n\r\nWe need to ensure that our pupils develop positive attitudes towards other people and cultures in the face of negative stereotypes and anti-European sentiment. A key recommendation from OFSTED in 2016 was that we need to involve more departments in multicultural work to broaden pupil awareness of other countries cultures and languages. \r\n\r\nWe have a very small MFL Department  and our project will involve other departments and staff from different roles and backgrounds to support whole school celebration of language and culture. Other departments will play an active role to embed internationalism across every part of the school, and create more extracurricular opportunities for pupils to be exposed to language and culture.\r\n\r\nThis project will build on previous, much smaller Erasmus+ project and the two people involved in the first will take a leadership/management role in this project.\r\n\r\nAs part of this project we would like to use 24 mobilities for members of staff participate in structured training courses in Spain (5 mobilities), France (3), Italy (10) and Germany (6).\r\n\r\nThe courses involve intensive language learning, cultural activities, teaching methodology and new ideas including ways to target children with low aspiration and low basic skills, and the opportunity to spend time in a Spanish school, developing links and observing practice.\r\n\r\nWe are incredibly proud of our school. After two years in special measures, we are seeing the benefits of our hard work and commitment to change. There are massive improvements which have been recognised through OFSTED monitoring. Now is the time for us to build on this in positive ways and establish a new ethos within our school that celebrates languages and diversity of cultures and gives our pupils high quality learning opportunities and the skills they need to support them in their future lives.", "http://www.allsaintscatholiccollege.com", "All Saints Catholic College", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046858_coordinator"], [2015, "Raising language aspirations", "All Saints Catholic College", 7656.0, 1, 1, "This project will improve teaching and learning in our languages department and across our school, and  positively impact on our pupils\u2019 attitude towards learning languages and other cultures.\r\n\r\nAs Spanish has recently been introduced to our curriculum, we would like to use this opportunity to develop the skills of our MFL staff, giving them the knowledge and confidence they need to be able to teach Spanish up to A level.\r\n\r\nWe also think that it is essential that a positive attitude towards other cultures is reinforced across the school and we wish to introduce a European dimension across the curriculum. We would like to use the opportunity of this project to look for ideas and resources to support colleagues in other departments to introduce an international element to their teaching.\r\n\r\nWe want to improve teaching in our school through finding new and innovative strategies to tackle particular issues such as improving the use of ICT to enhance learning, reinforcing literacy concepts through the teaching of languages, and finding strategies to support pupils with EAL, SEN and low basic skills. We want to develop our pupils\u2019 interest in other cultures and believe that developing a link with the school in Spain will be an effective way to improve our children\u2019s attitude towards other cultures, and show them the relevance of languages to their own lives. \r\n\r\nWe want to reinforce learning across the curriculum by encouraging more cross curricular collaborative work, and establish a resource library that can be shared by all departments to enhance teaching. \r\n\r\nAnother objective for us is to support our local partner primary schools who are introducing Spanish to the curriculum in Key Stage 2 for the first time. We would like to be a source of support to them, and want to use this opportunity to gather ideas and resources, skills and knowledge, which will help us to develop a training package to be able to support them.\r\n\r\nWe plan to develop a project over the course of the year. As part of this project, we would like to involve five members of staff in training courses in Spain.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen the course that we feel reflects our needs and is appropriate to helping us achieve our aims. The course will involve intensive language learning sessions, cultural activities relevant to our pupils, teaching methodology and new ideas. It also involves a placement in a Spanish school, allowing us to establish links that will be strong and long lasting. All members of staff will use the opportunity to observe practice within a different education system to help us to improve teaching and learning in our own school. \r\n\r\nWe will use the opportunity to build a personal link with a school in Spain to develop our pupils\u2019 interest in other cultures and increase their aspirations and openness. We will plan with the Spanish teachers ways in which we can build in regular opportunities to work together face-to-face and working on collaborative projects through eTwinning. We believe that having this opportunity to get to know Spanish pupils will lead to more enjoyment of learning, more motivation and therefore better attainment. We believe that this will be an effective way to contribute to changing our pupils\u2019 attitudes towards languages and other cultures. It will also make language learning more interesting as we will be able to focus on areas that the children are most interested in, and this will lead to increased uptake of languages in our school and a general positive attitude and raising of the profile of languages. \r\n\r\nThe project will support the introduction of Spanish to our school to GCSE and A level. This will mean that our pupils have more choice in what they study, and we can be confident that our school is in a position to teach Spanish consistently at higher levels.\r\n\r\nStaff will have a much improved level of Spanish, more up-to-date knowledge of current Spanish culture, a much better knowledge of different aspects of teaching, and many more teaching ideas. \r\n\r\nThe development of a link with the Spanish school will mean that our pupils are more motivated to learn and will have a much better insight into the reality of life in Spain. This will greatly help with their intercultural understanding and will positively impact on their attitudes towards language learning and other cultures. \r\n\r\nThere will be more provision available for our pupils such as extracurricular clubs and celebration events, we will develop new materials, planning formats and schemes of work which will be shared with other schools in our area. We will further develop our links with our partner primary schools, and will use the knowledge and skills gained on these courses to develop materials that can be used with them.", "http://www.allsaintscatholiccollege.com", "All Saints Catholic College", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012924_coordinator"]]}}}}
