Over 1 million refugees and migrants have crossed the borders to Europe in recent years. This migration represents a major challenge for health care systems that struggle to provide healthcare services, particularly for non-communicable diseases and disability. Refugees and migrants have complex health needs that are a result of a cumulative trauma experienced in their home countries, during their dangerous journey, or in the period of adjustment in their new country. This diverse and non-homogenous group also comes with resources in terms of resilience that we need to learn from and use in the healing process. However, they also face barriers accessing healthcare services because of language and cultural differences, differences in socio-economic status, and a lack of familiarity with local environment and healthcare system. There is a gap in competence of health care professionals, including PTs, to meet their complex needs, many of which can be addressed by physiotherapy. There is a clear lack of definition regarding PTs competencies needed to serve refugees and migrants, and a lack of common strategies to address challenges of migration which has negative implications for health. \r\n\r\nProject objectives\r\nPREP aims to build competencies of PTs working in rehabilitation services for refugees and migrants by establishing core competencies for effectively serving this population, and by launching an open online course to bring to scale the identified competencies to a larger audience. \r\n\r\nProject participants\r\nThe project involves around 20 key informants (PTs and refugees) for the identification of core competencies as background for the consensus process. Stakeholders with particular knowledge in this field, participate in the Delphi survey to reach consensus. 150 PTs participate in and evaluate the course \u201cPhysiotherapy in rehabilitation services for refugees and immigrants\u201d. Following evaluation, the course will be revised and made freely available.  Stakeholders are invited to attend the multiplier events. \r\n\r\nProject activities \r\nAll project activities will be implemented in a step-by-step approach starting with identification and building international consensus on core PT competencies for rehabilitation for refugees and migrants.  Identification of a set of core competencies, established through a scoping review, interviews with key informants, and consensus building, will result in a report describing core PT competencies for rehabilitation of refugees and migrants. Once the competencies are identified, a curriculum is developed. Guided by the curriculum, we design and implement an open online course. The online course will be developed collaboratively in a series of design and production workshops, and piloted with up to 150 learners recruited by partners from five different countries. Four multiplier events will be used to disseminate results and share the lessons learned beyond this partnership.\r\n\r\nMethodology \r\nThe project implementation methodology is based on collaboration between five partners from higher education, health and non-governmental sectors from six countries. The PREP methodology is built on the strengths of each partner. The principles of agile project management and learning design will be used to implement the project activities, as it is a dynamic, incremental, iterative, and collaborative approach to flexibly respond to the needs that emerge in the project implementation.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe project activities will result in a report describing core competencies for PTs needed to deliver rehabilitation service for refugees and migrants. Curriculum describing themes and learning outcomes accessible for other institutions. An online course on physiotherapy services for refugees and migrants incorporating audiovisual materials consisting of up to 10 modules. A freely accessible online course that builds competencies of PTs for working with refugees and migrants, and increased capacity of up to 150 physiotherapists to meet the rehabilitation needs of refugees and migrants.\r\n\r\nImpact \r\nIt is expected that the project will have multiple long term impacts on 1) competency development among practicing and future PTs by creating open online educational resource for PTs that will be freely available after the completion of the project; 2) health human resource management and development by allowing managers to base their planning and training decisions on the core PT competencies for rehabilitation of refugees and migrants identified in this project, and 3) services provided to this population by better trained PTs.", "http://members.physio-pedia.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NO01-KA203-038891_3"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 1308379.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_19231"], [2016, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 1136650.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_20106"], [2017, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 872252.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_23440"], [2017, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 732692.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_25643"], [2016, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 649514.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_25719"], [2016, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 649514.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_25720"], [2017, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 610577.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_27455"], [2017, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 436126.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_30418"], [2016, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 405946.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_30008"], [2016, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 405946.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_30021"], [2016, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 405946.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_30022"], [2016, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 405946.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_30038"], [2017, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 348901.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_33155"], [2017, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 348901.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_33211"], [2017, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 348901.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_33220"], [2016, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 324757.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_32798"], [2016, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 284162.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_34601"], [2016, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 243568.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_35989"], [2017, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 209341.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_38408"], [2017, "INTERNATIONAL NGO SAFETY ORGANISATION", 139560.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_43435"]]}}, "2RP": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKET ASSOCIATION LIMITED", 2246.0, "Other management expenditure (12.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_33081"], [2016, "INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKET ASSOCIATION LIMITED", 705.0, "Other management expenditure (12.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_40296"]]}}, "2RU": {"cordis": {"data": [[1506816000000, 1632960000000, "AdvanCed Hardware/Software Components for Integrated/Embedded Vision SystEms", "NVIDIA Ltd", "ACHIEVE-ETN aims at training a new generation of scientists through a research programme on highly integrated hardware-software components for the implementation of ultra-efficient embedded vision systems as the basis for innovative distributed vision applications.
