Parks, along with squares, are the places of sociability, where people can interact and play in sport fields or playgrounds, relax, study, walk their dogs. In this context, the young participants will complete a programme of activities such as decoration and renovation of part of the furniture of the park (benches, bocce ball court, playground, fences). The participants will be supervised during the activities by group leaders and staff of the municipality of Formigine. \r\nThe exchange programme envisages the combination of manual work, conferences, debates, and leisure and socializing activities in the sports complex of the area (swimming, volleyball, basketball, football, beach volleyball), as well as bike rides, walks and outdoor activities across parks, by using cycling paths and visiting youngsters aggregation places. The programme foresees also tours on the municipal and provincial area, a trip to a big city in the Emilia-Romagna area, an excursion to one of the most famous cities in northern Italy, as well as intercultural nights and participation in summer events who will take place in Formigine.\r\nYoung people participating in the exchange will have the opportunity to meet new cultures, habits and lifestyles, through non-formal learning activities, as well as strengthening values such as solidarity, democracy and friendship, having the opportunity to discuss and become familiar with the themes of inclusion, diversity and cultural integration.

The objective is to solve actual market needs by achieving the single stage treatment and industrial evaluation of nanostructured aluminium alloys. The overall research methodology of the Nanocoat project will follow a progression from detailed laboratory studies through scale-up to applications testing on industrial aluminium grades under industrial relevant conditions, to evaluate their structural and functional characteristics, the reproducibility of the process, and to deliver to end-users suitable test structures as predemonstrators. It is expected that on controlling the formation of the anodised nano-size cell structures on aluminium it will be possible to achieve novel performance in terms of adherence, wettability, corrosion and wear, and adsorption/absorption properties. The scope of applications is very large in the field of surface engineering.
