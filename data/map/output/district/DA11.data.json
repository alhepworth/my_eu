The internationalization of the techniques and tools used in schools would allow teachers to implement a more attractive teaching method, able to enhance socio-affective skills, to intercept different cognitive styles, to focus on the difficulties of each student in order to reduce the percentage of school dropouts, as required by the ET2020 strategic framework. \r\nThe project revolves around the issue of school dropout, which is a multidimensional phenomenon that goes beyond the school context itself and that depends also on the adolescent\u2019s life and social environment. The framework of the context refers to users with low rates of study motivation and high levels of school dropout in an area at high social risk in which the school discomfort can no longer be considered as an emergency, but actually as a structural feature of the training system and this calls for a new revision. A training course led abroad would enable teachers, through their comparison with colleagues from other countries, to acquire new group class management techniques in order to detect and prevent the phenomena of school drop-out, which undoubtedly represents an element to counteract.\r\nThe teachers that will take part in this project are highly motivated to increase their  didactic, methodological, linguistic  competencies as well as ICT abilities, in order to improve the educational offer of that the Institute, promoting this project, is able to deliver.\r\nThe main aims that the project is going to pursue are the following: \r\n- to explore, develop and evaluate the best practices resulting from the cooperation of a large group of teachers and educators;\r\n- to attend English language courses in order to reach level B2 in anticipation of a possible CLIL course;\r\n- to acquire language skills in L2 for professional debates and prepare more interesting teaching materials and tools able to adapt to different learning needs;\r\n-to reduce the level of early school drop-out;\r\nThe number of participants will be of 15 people, and they will be selected among the teaching and management staff of the Institute and the group will live an experience functional to the improvement and strengthening of their competencies within the partner institutes in United Kingdom, which are, more precisely, the Conlan School in St. Asaph and the Tellus Education Group in Plymouth, coordinated by T.E.E.P. \u2013 Training Education and European Project. \r\nThe activities planned and offered by the Institute are the following:\r\n- statistical analysis of cohorts, analysis of the criteria of selection of those students resulting more at risk; \r\n- use of active listening techniques and peer-tutoring so as to identify difficulties and/or criticisms;   \r\n- personalized interventions;\r\n- feedback and evaluation results.\r\nThe need to evaluate students\u2019 performance, along with the implicit/explicit expressions of discomfort is not new, but the methodological tools of research characterizing this project are innovative, based on a \u201cpreventive approach\u201d and connected to aspects of both statistical and psycho-pedagogical nature. \r\nThe project will monitor the impact on the general didactic activity of the institute and will evaluate whether the training activities carried out abroad will have triggered the change and innovation desired.

Sustainability of such services is crucial, as the research supported by them is more and more crucial for European competitiveness \u2013 and sustainability can be planned better if the costs are known. The emerging commercial offerings (Cloud-based HTC and HPC solutions) pose additional challenges and opportunities for sustainability. They represent new ways of explicit monetisation of computing and open the way to new business models (e.g. service fees or of lease industrial resources). The upcoming next framework programme and broader EU policies depend on more careful impact assessment, which requires accurate cost estimates. Similarly energy saving and green computing will be increasingly relevant, and project results will also allow estimating potential benefits in these areas. It is thus vital to understand the cost of the dedicated computing related e-Infrastructures, as expressed by EGI and PRACE initiatives.

After many years of suffering multiple barriers to exclusion including health issues, substance abuse, homelessness, mental health problems and prejudice, a very special programme of support is necessary to rebuild confidence and prepare a pathway to societal inclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their home locality all partners offer specialist integration programmes and each have a recognised good practice to share at transnational level.

A Transnational Partnership's staff team exchanges good practices, recognises innovation and builds a joint Toolkit for use in each setting.

They are hosted by Common Work in Kent, UK and Provita in Romania, respectively. They results in certificated recognition of skills, accredited by Common Work and a Europass Award is also earned by participants completing the training course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Project Objectives include:\r\n\r\n- To create a Transnational Steering Group to develop a joint methodology for supporting combating exclusion through promoting healthy living and self-sufficiency.\r\n\r\n- To create a residential training course as a foundation for further learning, with work experience and practical exercises, elements on horticulture and agriculture for self-sufficiency and promoting healthy living.\r\n\r\n- To work with partners to recognise key elements for overcoming social exclusion, exchanging good practice and developing innovation in training styles, inclusion methodologies, guidance and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anticipated results include one new Network for Innovation, 5 organisations developing new social inclusion activities linked to skills for employment and the award of Europass to 52 participants. The project also produces a Certificate in Self-Sufficiency to be awarded to all participants completing the training course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities include two parts of a residential training course, one part in the UK and one in Romania, spanning different elements of self-sufficiency and organic growing, empowerment and healthy living.
