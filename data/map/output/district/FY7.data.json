This is particularly so with young people who have poor records of academic achievement or are socially disadvantaged. At present, fewer than 1% of persons under the age of 21 in the UK will undertake a work-related mobility placement. This project will directly address this national shortcoming and will contribute to the Lisbon and Europe 2020 Strategies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootball clubs are fairly unique entities in the access to the media of publicity and this will prove an excellent dissemination vehicle to encourage other young people to seek out mobility opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFleetwood Town FC\u2019s dissemination activities will be complemented by our Austrian partner, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility.

Activities on the course will include the opportunity to visit a French school and take part in French school activity. Participants will stay in a small French community.

Family aspirations are low and there is a lack of opportunities provided by families for our pupils. Staff audits were done when the new MFL Coordinator took on her role to gather an understanding of the provision of languages across the school. Needs were identified and research began to find a project that would address the needs and aid the school in moving forward with language learning.

Ensure that internationalism and learning about other cultures in evident across our school, not only in stand-alone lessons, but in everyday situations. Make language learning purposeful for our childrenIncrease motivation, enjoyment and self-esteem in language learning for both staff and pupils. The school plans to send eight members of staff on an immersion course in France over a two year period. Each participant will go with different aims in mind and on return disseminate the knowledge and skills learned to their colleagues. They will return with a bank of resources to then be shared and used to improve practice. Partnerships with a link school in France will be built between both staff and pupils. Whilst in France, participants will attend ability-grouped language classes to develop their competence in speaking the language. They will be given opportunities to experience the French culture and gather resources to share with the pupils and their colleagues. By the end of the project, cultural diversity will be evident in both KS2 and KS1 with pupils who are more aware of internationalism and cultures other than their own. Our pupils will be more aware of the opportunities available to them. Staff will be more equipped to meet the expectations of the National Curriculum and support pupils in their language learning. The school will see an increase in motivation and enthusiasm within both staff and pupils. By the end of the project, the school will have firm language foundations and be in a position to apply for further funding with the intention of sending pupils to experience other cultures in Europe for themselves.", "http://www.charles.lancsngfl.ac.uk", "Charles Saer Community Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023984_coordinator"]]}}}}
