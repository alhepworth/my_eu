This site is important for active blanket bog and represents the most south-easterly occurrence of the habitat in Europe. It also forms part of two SPAs (Special Protection Areas according to the Birds Directive) whose Annex 1 species, including golden plover, dunlin, short-eared owl and merlin, are dependent on blanket bog for breeding and/or feeding. The conservation status of the site is under threat due to almost two centuries of heavy sulphate and nitrate pollution, leading to the destruction or severe depletion of the essential sphagnum moss cover of these moors. Consequently, fire damage has led to more extreme levels of erosion than if the moorlands had remained sphagnum-rich. Erosion is so widespread that it is difficult for sphagnum to become re-established, while even areas retaining sphagnum cover remain under continued threat of further erosion and fires. The restoration of favourable moorland conditions therefore depends on the re-establishment of a sphagnum-rich bog surface.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3539", "http://www.moorsforthefuture.org.uk/moorlife ,", "life_188"], [1999, "Natura 2000 Rivers  - Safeguarding Natura 2000 Rivers in the UK", "English Nature", 1819483.0, 909741.0, "The conservation of river systems is a complex and challenging task.  They are subject to a wide range of manmade pressures, with the result that many associated habitats and species deemed to be of importance at a European level have declined across their natural range.  Yet, compared to other habitat systems, relatively little is known about the ecological dynamics and requirements of rivers and the species that live in them.  This project focused on 7 pSCI rivers in different parts of the UK, totalling around 872 km.  Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera. They also represent a typical cross section of the different land uses, socio-economic users and threats associated with rivers in the UK, and indeed in the rest of Europe.\n\nThis LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. \n\nFirst, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.  Ultimately, the project aimed to develop techniques for addressing key issues associated with river conservation and demonstrate best practice which could then be widely disseminated within the UK and other Member States.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=550", null, "life_154"], [1995, "South Pennine Moors - South Pennine Moors  - An Integrated Management Strategy and Conservation Action Programme", "Standing Conference of South Pennine Authorities (SCOSPA)", 673059.0, 201918.0, "The South Pennine Moors support an important community of breeding birds, including four species of European importance under the Birds Directive \u2013 merlin (Falco columbari), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria) and short-eared owl (Asio flammeus). The windswept moorlands are the southernmost nesting grounds for many of the characteristic species, including an important population of twite (Acanthis flavirostris). Lying between two national parks and within easy access to 12 million people in the conurbations of Manchester, Leeds, Bradford and other major industrial towns, the chief threat to the moors is the absence of co-ordinated strategic management. Thus, a host of pressures from increased recreational use to agricultural land use changes and development proposals including wind power generation, are at present tackled without the benefit of a broad strategy and guiding principles to take account of the nature conservation importance of the area, and implications for the breeding bird populations in particular.", "http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=65", null, "life_191"]]}}}}
