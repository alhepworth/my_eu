Daniel Challenge involves personal development and growth through  social action and community involvement  It draws young people from across the UK, Europe and further afield between the ages of 18 -30 years, in groups of between 8 and 16 in number. They are from wide range of social and academic backgrounds. The programme is a 10 month course that starts in September and finishes in July.

No instances of true multi vehicle chargers (ie many types of vehicle/charging system on charge at the same time) were found.\nThis is due to the complexities arising around electrical harmonic interactions between vehicles under charge and the various charging methodologies. Sufficient work to define these has not been carried out and no vehicle or charger unit impact data is available over the longer term. Potential service providers face a choice between cosmetic combinations or multiple different charging stations, a costly option, low in flexibility.\nThe MultiCharge project will deliver a comprehensive picture of the harmonics between different vehicles and charging methodologies, before using software modelling to analyse the interactions and develop a Harmonic Filter to enable true multi-vehicle charging. MultiCharge replaces the active electronic module and multiple transformers present in most current EV chargers, with a single 3 phase 440 volt main passive unit comprising a zigzag auto transformer, harmonic filter, interphase transformer & rectifier block and distribution bus & control unit.\nThe project will deliver social and economic growth via increased uptake of cleaner to run, cheaper to use Electric Vehicles.\nWe will achieve this through delivery of an affordable re-charging system based upon market leader Carroll & Meynell's own technology, patented buck boost units and zigzag transformer to enable significant reductions in the cost of providing appropriate electricity supply to EV charging stations.", 35842.0, 51203.0, 1, 1, "MultiCharge", null, null, null, "h2020_196224_952374810"]]}}}}
