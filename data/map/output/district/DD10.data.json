Now, nearly two years later, all classes from Nursery right up to P7 are engaging with learning language on a regular basis, with this increasing in depth and frequency as each term passes. The learning of L2 is in our school Improvement Plan and as a school we are committed to continue to strengthen the use of L2 within our day to day practice.  However at some staff Personal Professional reviews it was noted there was a  lack of confidence in the teaching of L2. As it is priority at both school and teacher level we held a meeting to discuss ways we could move forward. As a result, Senior Management Team with the help of the school Language Ambassador, carried out an audit asking staff to consider their skills set with regard to the teaching of languages. The results demonstrated that there was a very broad range of experience and varying levels of confidence amongst staff. Having had two members of staff complete an Immersion course previously and witnessing first hand the huge positive impact it had on their learning and teaching of L2 and L3 other staff felt it would be of benefit to their professional development in the teaching of languages. \r\n\r\nStaff selected for participation come from all stages of the school from nursery to P7, to Pupil Support staff, including Senior Management Team. There is a wide range of French ability within these staff members from those with formal qualifications to those learning for themselves  an elementary level There are also differences in the their cultural awareness of France, ranging from those who have visited France on holiday,  or school excursions, to those with no experience at all;  two members have never visited France before. There may be variation of language level and experience, however the members are united in their enthusiasm and commitment to improve their understanding of the French Language and Culture and imparting our knowledge onto the children of Bervie Primary School.\r\n\r\nThe staff  primarily hope to develop their own competence and confidence  in speaking, reading and understanding of the French language. This upskilling will enable them to embed languages more confidently in their daily classroom practice on a wider scale. During the course, participants hope to gain a broader and deeper understanding of the methodology used in the teaching of French to our young learners, gain new skills and techniques for teaching modern languages in a primary school and learn how to most effectively embed it, not only in the classroom but throughout the school.  This will further develop the 1+2 experience for all young learners within our school. They believe a week long immersion course in France (rather than one based in the UK) will help develop their cultural awareness of France and provide them with the authentic and invaluable teaching and learning experience , in a genuine French setting. They will cascade these experiences  throughout the school. \r\n\r\nOn return from France, the staff intend to share any resources, teaching methods and cultural awareness gained, throughout the school, parents and local community, the cluster and beyond to any other interested parties through twilights, 1+2 inservice days, working with the Language Development Officer to promote language learning, and through use of technology such as twitter and GLOW. \r\nWe believe as a school due to the high number of participants this year, after the course, there will be a greater opportunity  to be able to undertake proposed, including, twinning with a French school, forging links to cultural agencies in the local community and the wider North East of Scotland and re holding International events previously ran by our ML Specialist. \r\n\r\nBy attending the course, we foresee building a concrete link to firstly France and then hopefully wider Europe, to support the implementation of the 1+2 policy within school.

It has an ever increasing roll with a growing number of children arriving with English as a Second Language or with no English at all. Our catchment area is very mixed including significant numbers of children from areas with social deprivation. We have classes from Primary 1 to 7 and are a two stream school with some stages being 3 stream. We also have morning and afternoon nursery for pre and ante-pre school aged children. Additionally we are a resourced school for children with special educational needs.\r\n\r\nThe two participants are both staff at Lochside Primary teaching at Second Level. One is teaching L2 French and the other L3 Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe staff have previously attended  the Full Immersion Course provided by LFEE in France  as part of a larger project to develop language teaching and global citizenship in the school. They would now like to attend the course in order to improve their language skills , subject knowledge and confidence to teach pupils and to help train their colleagues in L3 Spanish.  They would also like to get a deeper understanding of  culture and through the e-twinning project be able to promote the European dimension and internationalism to the school and community.\r\n\r\nHaving the participants attend the course will fulfil several needs of the school and cluster and impact on our pupils and their families as well as colleagues  in the school, cluster and local authority.    Firstly it will provide us with a core group of staff who have received quality training in a relevant context and feel confident and enthusiastic about teaching Spanish. The participants will plan and lead workshops for the whole staff  to share any strategies and resources gained on the course.  The plan is to continue to collect a bank of resources that will be available to the school staff and to cluster colleagues through the Language Co-ordinator forum.   Finally,  there is a need to develop digital literacy and ICT in all subjects of the curriculum.  \r\n\r\nAs the Scottish government's 1+2 Languages initiative is a major priority across the country, it will be addressed  in our school's planning as we approach the 2020 deadline. This is to ensure we meet the demands of the Scottish Government regarding the teaching and learning of modern languages.  The participants hope to be able to contribute to the implementation of this policy in our school, cluster and authority.

This is essential to ensure the pupils in Scotland are provided with an education that will allow them to be equipped for jobs in the future. Language learning has vast benefits to our brains and can even prevent the onset of diseases such as dementia. The Scottish Government is forward thinking in understanding the need to introduce a norm for language learning in schools based on the European Union 1+2 model.  It is the job of teachers, like us, to ensure the Government policy is met and we provide the conditions in which every child is  learning two languages in addition to their own mother tongue.  In our local authority the first modern language the pupils will engage in is French.  To meet this target, the staff in schools need to develop their own French language skills.  Each school in our authority was given the opportunity to attend and Immersion course in France. Three teachers from Borrowfield have volunteered to attend an immersion course in France (giving up a week of their school holidays) to train and develop our ability to read, write, speak and understand the French language.  These three teachers are enthusiastic and have a basic understanding of the French language.  We can not only educate children in the spoken language, it is imperative that we also develop an understanding of French culture, something that can not be taught through the use of online resources or textbooks. Attending the LFEE immersion course will allow us to:\r\n\r\n- improve methodological expertise in teaching French\r\n- provide us with materials suitable for teaching French\r\n- develop cultural awareness, understanding of contemporary France and develop knowledge of the Education system in France\r\n- improve our own competency in French\r\n- understand how to use ICT resources\r\n\r\nWe will take part in daily lessons whilst on the immersion course and we will engage in cultural trips where we can practice using the French language with native speakers.  However, our overall aim is to embed the French language and culture in our school(s) with staff being confident in their own abilities.  In turn, we will then be able to meet the new 1plus2 Government initiative.\r\n\r\nOnce we have engaged with new resources and have a better understanding of the French culture, we will disseminate the learning to staff in Borrowfield and Natalie will share learning in all schools in Angus and with the Staff Tutors in PanTayside. This collaborative approach will ensure our new skills and knowledge will be cascaded to hundreds of teachers in authorities other than our own. One class teacher in Borrowfield has linked with a school in France and we all hope to support this teacher by sharing our learning of what school is like in France.  Natalie is in the process of linking other schools and again will share school culture with colleagues who are involved in using eTwinning. Pupils will also have the opportunity to communicate using ICT.  It is important our learning is shared not only in school but also in the wider community so parents, carers and the general public are aware of 1+2 and the need for learning languages. Therefore, we will share our learning with the wider community so everyone understands the importance of maintaining our European links.  By attending the immersion courses, we would also all hope to develop a network of colleagues who would be able to support each other on our learning journey. When in France, we will make links with other schools and businesses with whom we could use ICT to communicate with once we have returned to Scotland. We even hope to hold an Immersion CPD.  This would involve inviting all teachers in Angus (including Rebecca Crabb and Carole Lyons) to a training session where Natalie and others who have attended an Immersion Course, share what they learned i.e. cascading our knowledge and resources with all teachers in Angus.  The impact this LFEE Europe Immersion course could have on our professional learning and personal learning is vast.  However, this same impact will then be felt by teachers who attend our twilights this year and in the future. \r\n\r\nOverall, we hope to pass on our enthusiasm for learning other languages to the pupils in our class and school.
