West Lothian Council have developed their own implementation plan requiring; firstly, that all schools, through their Secondary School cluster groups, and, secondly, identify lead learners who will receive training in specific modern European languages. On completion of appropriate training these staff members will then disseminate their learning, new methodology and resources and share these within their own school, their cluster and the authority through meetings and online forums. Blackburn Primary School is at the very early stages in developing their policy on the 1+2 Approach. They have identified a member of staff who has an interest and natural competence in this area and have identified a suitable training opportunity for her, an immersion course in Spanish, which will provide her with the language skills, new teaching approaches and materials to become the school's lead learner. Miss Carson has worked closely with the school's senior management team to develop a draft outline for this project, detailing a programme of personal study, development of materials, sharing of information to all stakeholders, staff training, teaching and learning for pupils in the upper stages of the school and has identified ways to begin to evaluate this project and its impact.The aims identified are to improve the teaching and learning of languages by introducing and developing a strong European dimension in the school through the use of new and engaging teaching methods, new resources and an increased opportunity to use active, context based learning and ICT to enhance pupil's experiences. Our vision is to widen the children's limited view of their place within Europe and to equip them with skills for learning, life and work that may ultimately lead to employment in an European country.  There will be an opportunity to find partner school's by liaising with the course provider and developing an e-twinning aspect to the project. This  potential link with a partner school in another European country can only enhance our pupils' knowledge and skills and put their learning of languages into a real-life context.As a result of this project all members of staff will be trained in new ways to teach a language in their classroom, provided with materials, advice and support from Miss Carson. Pupils will have opportunities to learn not only the Spanish language, but aspects of its culture through more engaging learning activities using a range of materials and accessing ICT to link with pupils from a partner school. Miss Carson will be equipped to engage in professional dialogue, sharing ideas, methodology and materials with teachers from our cluster group, the local authority and nationally through online forums and teacher meeting events.The overall impact of this project will be the development of a new approach to learning and teaching modern European languages that can be adopted and used by all staff within Blackburn Primary School.  Spanish language and culture will be embedded in the upper stages of the school, with pupils, staff, parents and the wider community engaging in special events, raising the awareness of the European dimension.", "http://www.blackburnprimary.co.uk", "Blackburn Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023511_coordinator"]]}}, "8HQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Language Training", "Croftmalloch Primary School", 5828.0, 1, 1, "Four teachers hope to attend the full immersion course in Malaga, Spain, in  April 2016.  The reason that they are interested in attending the course is to ensure that L3 (Spanish) can be rolled out in Croftmalloch Primary by the deadline of 2020.   One of the teachers interested in attending has a deep interest in fitness and teaches PE as part of her remit within the school.  She is interested in gaining practical ideas to teach modern languages within the context of PE - for example by delivering instructions in a foreign language/doing warm ups/cool downs in Spanish.  She, as well as her colleagues, are looking to embed L3 within classroom routines and joint projects.   Indeed, this training fits in with the Scottish Government's pledge to ensure that two modern languages are embedded in the primary school (one starting from the age of five and the other from age 9).  Presently, we do not have any teachers trained to deliver Spanish, therefore the training course will help ensure that this happens.  The participants who are keen to attend are enthusiastic about language learning and have an international outlook.  They believe that having the opportunity to study abroad with native speakers is a valid and very rewarding experience.  The impact will be immediate, speaking from experience, as one of our staff members has already attended a French language immersion course, and the tools and pedagogy learnt from that course, became vital in the teaching of French throughout the whole school.  This will also be the case with Spanish!  The course will provide ample opportunities for active learning, provide resources and highlight cultural differences and similarities.  Staff attending will have detailed notes, take photographs and create a presentation to feedback to the rest of the staff/cluster about the overall experience.  There will be opportunities to cascade our knowledge upon our return, as directed by our Headteacher, and try out different practical activities with our pupils (masterclass).  We are also hopeful that we can set up a simple etwinning project and invite cultural organistations (such as SCILT - Scotland's National Centre for Languages ) into the school to help deliver a whole school assembly - which will, in turn, raise the profile of modern languages.  Our Headteacher will also monitor the implementation of the 1+2 language policy within the school and look for evidence as to how it is being used within our school - by for example, looking at wall displays, speaking to the children about their experiences and so on.  The impact will be huge as our staff will gain training which they will be able to cascade to others at a local and national level and our pupils will receive good quality teaching in Spanish which will hopefully have an impact on their cultural awareness and increase the enthusiasm and  uptake of modern languages at the senior phase.", null, "Croftmalloch Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013215_coordinator"]]}}, "9JR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Developing Languages in the Primary Setting", "St John the Baptist Catholic Primary School", 3515.0, 1, 1, "At St. John the Baptist Primary School, we have identified that many of our pupils across all levels in the school have little knowledge on the European Union and the countries involved in this Union. This was identified by one of the staff members who will be representing our school at the LFEE immersion course in Lyon. All staff members in school are currently teaching French and informing our pupils of the French culture. Many members have completed the 1+2 Languages course provided by West Lothian Council's 1+2 development team to aid our school improvement plan in implementing the 1+2 policy. Our lead learner for 1+2 have assisted all staff members in training by offering us courses provided by West Lothian Council and highlighting new resources which can be used in the classroom.To address the issue identified above, the two staff members who are willing to attend the LFEE immersion course, have agreed on a project with the Head Teacher and Lead Learner, and have discussed this with other members of staff. This project aims to give the whole school an opportunity to learn about countries involved in the European Union by planning and preparing a Modern Languages week in school. Each class will focus on a European country and will learn some of the language that they use, learn about their culture and possibly experience some of their famous dishes such as croissants. This will give our learners the opportunity to experience different languages and cultures that are part of the European Union. Evidence of the learning taking place during this week long event will be achieved by teachers taking photos using the school iPads and these photos being posted on our school website and a display board in school for the parents and children to see. This project will be undertaken by all staff members in school, but led by the 2 staff members who have been on the LFEE immersion course. Resources and teaching methods gained from the immersion course will compliment this project well, as will the resources the school already has. Feedback will be obtained using the Survey Monkey questionnaire website, which will be completed by class teachers with their pupils and through professional dialogue between colleagues. If this project is successful, it may become an annual event for the whole school and nursery to participate in. This will give all pupils in the school an insight into the lives of people living in other European countries, as many pupils in our school may not have had the opportunity to travel abroad and experience other cultures. In the long term, this will feed into our school introducing the second language as part of the 1+2 Scottish Government policy and our school improvement plan.", null, "St John the Baptist Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023977_coordinator"]]}}}}
