The composition of the partnership enables the exchange of experiences and peer learning between choral educators cooperating with ensembles of different sizes and characteristics, embedded in different educational structures. Through the exchange of experiences and peer learning activities, direct meetings and on-line cooperation between highly professional, experienced educators and less experienced, amateur or young choral staff members, ADD UP contributes to the enhancement of the participants\u2019 skills, and furthermore strengthten the participating organisations through development of their potential (better skilld trainers within the organizations) and educational offer (tailor-made programme of trainings for choral conductors).The aquired competencies and the pedagogical methods exchanged and practiced during the project lifetime will be adaptable not only in the partner organizations but also easily shareable with other cultural organizations dealing with choral education.The role of the musical directors and coaches in the choir is to serve as a high-profile, enthusiastic advocate and promoter of choral music. The system of work during the project lifetime and the goal of the peer-learning method integrated into the project aims to improve these capacities to inspire and energise. The local activities combine online activities based on Social Media, self-paced learning on the theoretic material and practical work with local choirs active within the participating orgnizations. The project includes short-term training activities for participants, organized in all countries of the partnership: the practical workshops  incorporated in the transnational trainings will constitute a possibility of work-based learning and each training event will be ended by a short concert open to the public. These concerts will be a good ocasion to disseminate the project idea and it\u2019s results. In the frame of the project activities, especially during the paractical workshops and concerts a set of video and audio recordings will be created and will be made accessible through the project\u2019s and partners\u2019 websites along with conducting tips and written presentation of the music analysed during the project lifetime.The Strategic Partnership, thanks to its international dimension brings an essential added value enabling an exchange of experiences between participants presenting different cultural approaches to the choral music, a profound analysis of different types of choral music from the project countries and presentation of their subjective perceptions, and by these means an improvement of intercultural skills, cultural awereness and cultural intelligence. The possibility of work in international group boosts also other social competences of the participants, notably flexibility, freedom from prejudice, handling stress, self confidence, sense of belonging and, last but not least language competences and digital competences (i.e. use of Social Media and virtual workgroups).To certify the competences and skills acquired during the transnational staff training events, the participants of the project will get the Europass Mobility documents and complete or update the Europass CV and Language Passports.ADD UP involves also other, less direct and indirect target groups:- choral conductors and educators from collaborating organisations (about 80 educators);- choristers from ensembles and choirs collaborating with the participating organisations and project\u2019s participants  (about 400 choristers) - will be involved in the activities at all stages off the project and their contribution in the project realisation will be fundamental. During the transnational training events the choristers will be invited for the working sessions with the project participants and will present the results of the workshops at a short concert ending each training event. Between the transnational trainings, the choristers will work with the local participants of the project on the repertoire chosen for the project;- people from other indirect target groups - formal and informal partners of participating organizations, including professional and amateur choristers, artistic education providers, cultural centers organizing artistic events in the local communities, stakeholders interested in the development of the cultural sector, it\u2019s educational offer and traising standards (about 100 persons).", "http://www.20000voices.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA202-026448_1"]]}}}}
