Our aim is to meet the demands of these diverse markets providing a high performance, low maintenance solution with reduced energy usage and superior operational performance which our extensive market research has validated a significant commercial interest in our objectives.\nEZ-Liner offers major advantages in trenchless relining for long runs of pipe in a single operation with associated reduced labour, reduced energy costs, reduced disruption and reduced time for pipe repairs. By utilising a thermoplastic liner, instead of traditional epoxy methods, the risk of contamination from such chemicals will be eliminated. The traditional methods are labour intensive and expensive, typically \u20ac300 to \u20ac350/m2. Our method will improve relining speed by 100% achieving a target cost of \u20ac230/m2 by minimising labour. By developing a novel liner delivery system that focuses the heating and consolidation of the pipe to a narrow band we aim to reduce energy consumption by at least15%. Uniquely our design will achieve consolidation, even in pipe work with surface defects.\nThe system will utilise a conformable thermoplastic liner drawn through the pipe by a novel consolidating head. This will clear debris in the pipe by water jets, form the liner in the pipe and consolidate with locally produced steam providing reduced energy usage and losses. Focusing steam into a localised area avoids escape into surroundings or damaged pipe, as is prevalent in traditional methods. The system we will deliver will be safer and more robust making it simpler to operate and easier to maintain; ideally suited for the harsh environment of the pipe relining market.\nThe system will be primarily validated in the drinking water pipe relining industry.

With this in mind GETZ will be delivered via a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) to facilitate broad dissemination of the project\u2019s intellectual outputs and results. The initiative for the GETZ project comes from the continued prevalence of gender inequality in sport and the need to look at this issue from the perspective of the next generation.  The seven GETZ partners have recognized the presence of gender inequality in sport in their own countries and each are independently working on gender related projects.  Working collaboratively on GETZ will facilitate a consistent approach to educating future sport leaders on the issue of gender inequality.This is a 3 year project which will result in the creation of the GETZ MOOC and a gender equality research study.  A clear management structure, quality control, risk management measures and budget have been designed to ensure that the GETZ project is properly planned, organized and controlled.GETZ will be delivered to 200 students via the partner universities and it will be available to 840 regional sports clubs in Sweden.

The diploma responds to the needs of graduates, since their competences vary depending on the country and the student. Because of this it is difficult for working life to employ and for the institutes of higher education to admit the students. The diploma covers the competences in the area of business and administration but also the skills and competences needed for working and studying abroad. Diploma was developed for young students in school education and several schools are implementing it in six countries. An association EBBD e.V. was established before the Comenius project for the cooperation of business educators and for the accreditation of EBBD programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the previous project it has occurred that also in the adult education, where informal and non-formal learning is validated, there is a need and interest for adopting this kind of diploma. Additionally the feedback from European Commission in the previous project was that the diploma and the accreditation process are too complicated. This opinion is shared by the schools, which have been accredited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n\r\nProject\u2019s main objective is to develop the diploma to suit also non-formal and informal learning and simplify the accreditation process. By developing the diploma criteria to be based on learning outcomes and by writing them as competences, the structure of the diploma will be simplified. Additionally other requirements of the diploma will be modified to be more suitable for all target groups. The competence requirements of the institutes of higher education will be implemented in the diploma's requirements. The diploma\u2019s development work will also take into account the future needs of working life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant objective in the project is the dissemination of the understanding of the competence based learning and the dissemination of the EBBD diploma. Through dissemination and the large network of the partnership the diploma will be more recognized by European schools, the students, working life and higher education institutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPartnership\r\n\r\nThe project partnership includes seven upper secondary vocational colleges, one university and two associations. Most of the schools are also adult or apprentice educators in the field of business and administration. They are all implementing the diploma at the moment in school education.  The university will work as the evaluator of the products (diploma and accreditation process). The association of Vocational educators, EfVET, will work with dissemination and the association EBBD e.V. owns the accreditation process and is needed for the development process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents\r\n\r\nA national dissemination event for schools and teachers will be organized in each partner country. The Dutch partner will produce the training material for the training events in English language for the common understanding of the learning outcomes and for the assessment of the competences. Other parts of the events will be in national language. Round table discussions will be organized in the two EfVET conferences for dissemination of the diploma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject management\r\n\r\nEach partner has a specific area of responsibility within the project. The coordinator ensures that each partner knows the budget as well as the content and time schedule of their tasks in good time beforehand. Google Drive -tools are used for the development, reporting and planning work to ensure that each partner has direct access to all the documents, which are being developed and produced within the project. The use of Google Drive -tools guarantees that each partner knows how the project work concretely proceeds. There will be altogether six transnational project meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults and impact\r\n\r\nThe project's main result is the renewed diploma which is suitable for all. It is also simple and easy to implement. Secondly the accreditation process will be simplified and it can be implemented by using web tools.  Simplified diploma with possibilities to validate also non-formal and informal learning and user friendly accreditation process will attract new schools to implement EBBD. The result of the dissemination and training events is that the EBBD is known in Europe among the vocational education, high level institutes and working life. That will improve the mobility of the graduates of secondary level business education. Their admission to higher education and employment will also be improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn long term the diploma gives to Europe a tool for comparing competences between countries and graduates. It also enables student exchanges between schools and unifies Europe so that people can more freely move from one country to another for work or study purposes.
