The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other in order to develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and this job shadowing project is part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of the Childcare and education department and five schools: Lagersbergsskolan, H\u00e5llsta skola, Fristadsskolan, Skogstorpsskolan and Djurg\u00e5rdsskolan.  During the years 2017 \u2013 2019 we are planning to send a total of 22 staff members from these schools on job shadowing activities in Birmingham (head teachers, deputy head teachers, leaders of learning, teachers of Swedish as a second language and also special pedagogy teachers).   They will spend a week at one of our partner schools within the BCPP where they will have the opportunity to learn and get valuable experience that will be used in the quality development of their own schools.  \r\n\r\nIn this project the consortium has three objectives:\r\n\u2022 We want to gain knowledge and experience that will lead to a positive development of our schools with the aim to improve the quality of teaching and improve the pupils\u2019 results.   Besides looking at teaching methods, we would like to see how the staff and the teaching are organized in order to make the most optimal use of the resources and also how different schools work with collegial learning.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Through the job shadowing activities we want to gain knowledge and experience which leads to a development of methods in order to take care of and educate pupils who have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  We want to develop their knowledge of Swedish and to maximize their learning and results in the multicultural classroom.  Eskilstuna is a multicultural city where 31% of the pupils have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 We want to improve the quality and results within special pedagogy by educating the staff in finding and developing different teaching methods and tools in the teaching of special needs pupils.  We especially want to focus on methods and tools involving ICT.\r\n\r\nAfter the job shadowing activities the school development will progress at the individual schools, based on the needs of the school, what experience and knowledge that the staff has gained and also based on the reflections of what already works well.  Collegial learning will be a different factor in this work.\r\nThe development will also be driven forward by the Development unit at the Childcare and Education department.  Here there are networks for head teachers, deputy head teachers and leaders of learning where discussions and dissemination activities will take place, in order to share the experiences that have been made during the job shadowing activities with colleagues who are not in the project.  This way, the job shadowing activities can lead to positive development at other schools as well.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the knowledge and experience which we gain from the job shadowing activities will contribute to an improved quality of teaching and better results in general, but also more specifically within the teaching of Swedish as a second language in the multicultural classroom and within special pedagogics.   We hope that this project will help give the pupils a good foundation to stand on so that they can succeed in their future education and working life.", "http://www.st-thomas.walsall.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA101-034303_8"], [2018, "L\u00e4ra genom internationalisering", "St. Thomas of Canterbury Primary School", 25831.0, 2, 18, "The Childcare and Education department of Eskilstuna Municipality in Sweden, has the ambition to continuously develop and improve the quality of teaching, improve the results and give the pupils a good foundation in order for them to succeed with future education and work. The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.  It is also important to maintain the interest for internationalization at the schools where projects already exist.  \r\n\u2022 Increase the language competence and the interest in foreign languages, for head teachers, teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nIn our project there are eight head teachers and three deputy head teachers from the schools G\u00f6kstensskolan, Hammarg\u00e4rdets skola, \u00c4rstaskolan, Tegelviken, Bj\u00f6rktorpsskolan, Skiftingehus, Fr\u00f6slundaskolan och St\u00e5lforsskolan. All of them will do job shadowing activities in Birmingham, where they will have the opportunity to get inspiration and and ideas which will help them in their strategic quality development of their schools.  They will also be able to establish contacts for international collaboration for head teachers, teachers and pupils.   Furthermore, the job shadowing gives them a chance to improve their English, which will be valuable in their future collaboration.  For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and these job shadowing activities are part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe head teachers (all but one) will also take a course in order to learn more about Erasmus+ and how it can be effective in the strategic development of the school and in the collaboration with teachers and pupils from other countries.  They will learn how to anchor Erasmus+ in the work of the organization and use it as a tool.  The course also gives them a good opportunity to meet others and make connections for future KA1 and KA2 projects, as well as an opportunity to improve their language ability.  \r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the activities will lead to more schools in Eskilstuna having international projects and international collaboration.  Moreover, these projects are expected to lead to increased language ability among head teachers, teachers and pupils, to increased tolerance and understanding of different cultures and to make the pupils prepared for an international labor market.", "http://www.st-thomas.walsall.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038787_17"]]}}, "2JJ": {"nhs": {"data": [["RYK", "Bloxwich Hospital", "nhs_RYK01"]]}}, "2PA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "IFA VET mobility+ 2014", "Black Country University Technical College", 565120.0, 14, 39, "The funding applied for within the framework of the project will be used to finance stays abroad for a total of 559 individuals and 37 accompanying persons.\r\n321 apprentices will complete a 4 to 6 week internship specifically suited to their profession, individual level of training, knowledge and skills at a company active in their professional field. IFA will organize internships in small groups for the fall of 2014 and spring of 2015. Participation is open for apprentices from every profession and industry from all over Austria. The applicants will be selected based on their technical, linguistic and personal skills. IFA will organize the travel, stay abroad, internship, accommodation and insurance for the participants as well as any necessary accompanying language courses. IFA will also prepare the apprentices and companies organizationally, culturally and linguistically for the stays and ensure the internships are recognized as part of the apprenticeship training in accordance with the Vocational Training Act (BAG). \r\n174 students from vocational schools and colleges will also complete an internship relevant to their professional field that is suitable for their training and level of knowledge. The internships will be organized in close cooperation with the sending schools in order to ensure they are recognized as part of the compulsory internship. Most of the student internships will take place in the summer of 2014. The duration of the internship will range between 1 and 3 months.\r\n\r\nThe content of the internships is defined in terms of the occupational and training profiles and curricula as well as the individual skills of the participants and is specified before the internship begins in a learning agreement between IFA, the participants and the sending and receiving institutions together with the learning objectives that are to be achieved during the internship.\r\nGiven that a majority of the apprentices are minors, the apprentice groups will be accompanied by an IFA counselor during the first week abroad. The counselor will help the apprentices get settled in the host country and visit all the participating companies to ensure that the content and processes fulfill the learning agreements and objectives. Contact persons at the receiving institution and IFA will be available to support the participants throughout their entire stay abroad.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, within the framework of the project, 64 training officers from companies and vocational schools as well as vocational training experts will participate in a week-long workshop to exchange their experiences in order to learn about VET systems in other countries, compare them with the Austrian system and exchange ideas amongst each other and with colleagues from abroad. The goal is to promote the quality, innovation and the European idea in vocational education and training through cross-border exchanges. The participants are multipliers and can share their experiences in companies, schools and throughout Austria and thus contribute to a Europeanisation of the Austrian VET system.\r\n\r\nWhile abroad, the participants will acquire technical, linguistic, social, intercultural and personal skills and expand their personal and professional horizons. An internship abroad contributes to the strenghtening of important key skills such as teamwork, independence, personal responsibility, flexibility and much more. Experiences abroad promote career opportunities and ensure the future career of the participants and thus the competitiveness of Austrian companies. \r\nInternational exchange increases the overall quality of the Austrian VET. \r\n\r\nIFA is a non-profit association that has been organizing internships abroad since 1995 for apprentices, professionals and training officers. Since 1995, IFA has helped more than 6,500 people take part in an EU-funded stay abroad. As the applicant and co-ordinating institution, IFA will be responsible for ensuring the quality and proper organization of the project. \r\n\r\nIFA works with a network of experienced partners in the target countries with whom partnership agreements (Memoranda of Understanding) defining the conditions and quality criteria already exist. IFA has been successfully working together with most of the partner institutions for many years.\r\nThroughout the entire stay abroad, there is always someone from the receiving institution, the host company or IFA at the participant\u2019s side to supervise their progress and ensure the quality of the internship. \r\nUpon completing the internship, all the participants will receive a \u201cPersonal Transcript\u201d outlining the activities completed and knowledge and skills acquired with confirmation from the receiving institution and host company. \r\nAll internships will be recognized as part of the vocational training in Austria.", "http://www.blackcountryutc.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-AT01-KA102-000266_36"]]}}}}
