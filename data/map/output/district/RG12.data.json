The plant capacity is 10,000 t/y of fuel, of which 5,000 t/y fully synthetic paraffinic jet fuel, the rest is diesel and aviation gasoline.\n\nThe plant is based on technology that has been developed by Swedish Biofuels and LanzaTech, which. has been validated by the United States Air Force (USAF) and the United States Federal Aviation Authority (FAA). The technology has been granted patent protection in Europe the USA and the other major markets of the world. The plant, in the main, uses standard equipment. The non-standard equipment, roughly 10 % of the total, is to be manufactured by AS Remeksi Keskus.\n\nThe plant is to be constructed in Sweden on a site owned by Perstorp Bioproducts AB, the wood raw materials to be supplied by SCA Energy AB. The fuel will be used by Deutsche Lufthansa AG for flight tests. When the fuel is available it will used by Saab as part of a Sweden national study involving the Swedish jet fighter Gripen.\n\nAll products from the plant, jet fuel, diesel and aviation gasoline will be marketed by SkyEnergy BV.\n\nThe raw material base for the demonstration plant will be extended during the project by 1) the introduction of ethanol produced from municipal solid waste by Abengoa Bioenergia Nuevas Tecnologias SA 2) the use of biogas for the production of syngas by Perstorp.

Thus, whilst the pathogenesis of its notorious pathogens (C. botulinum, C. perfringens and C. difficile) is ascribed to the devastating toxins produced (neurotoxins, endotoxins and cytotoxins), it is their capacity to produce spores that lies at the heart of the diseases they cause. This is because spores play the pivotal role in the spread of infection (eg, C. difficile) and in foodstuff contamination and food poisoning (eg, C. botulinum and C. perfringens). The processes of spore formation (sporulation) and germination (return of the dormant spore to toxin-producing, vegetative cells), therefore, represent key intervention points. On the other hand, the majority of clostridia are entirely benign and can sustainably produce all manner of useful chemicals and fuels. Crucially, the regulation of chemical production is intimately linked to that of sporulation. Spores of benign species may also be used as a delivery system for treating cancer. Yet, despite the spore\u2019s importance, little is known of the developmental processes of sporulation and germination. This is because research and training efforts on Clostridium spores are fragmented and there is no coherence between researchers working on pathogenic and industrially important species.

There will also be a radio collaboration that will  bring to England the work previously carried out by teachers  and students in CEPA Arucas y Firgas. The coordinator of the English  organization, Dr Oliver, is  an expert on the use of art for educational  purposes and has also prepared a complete programme of study visits to world leading art institutions in the UK. Finally, there will be workshops to develop a quality Erasmus+ KA2 project to be submitted in the 2018 call. Meetings with other English potential partners will also be arranged. \r\n*Act. 2: Course in Cardiff, UK,  on the use of  innovative  technological procedures  in the adult education classroom for a teacher. The course also includes short jobshadowing experiences in local  adult education  schools. It would be very important for us to explore new paths to develop our international projects. \r\n*Act. 3: Course in Cascais, Portugal,  on the management of human capital, for a teacher. This will enable staff  to practise more effective measures to improve human relationships within  the school community.  It includes practical guidelines to develop the concept of leadership and basic training on \u201c coaching\u201d procedures. \r\n*Act. 4: English language courses in Dublin, Ireland , for the two teachers whose level of English is more basic. A proper command of English is a must in the development of international projects and as those two teachers  are also the ones who have  a steady position at the school. Strenghthening their English language skills is crucial for the consolidation of the international projects in the long run. \r\nTeaching staff deeply commited to improving their foreign language skills and making  an effort to be involved in international collaborations is the best way to transmit to students a sense of understanding of our globalised world. This is particularly important in the case of adult students, who usually come from disadvantaged backgrounds and need more support. Ironically enough,  at leat in our country , they are also often  deprived of the most ambitious educational  projects, like CLIL, that may enable them to boost their chances to succeed  in life.
