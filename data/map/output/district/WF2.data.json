Very often young people's interest in their future is dominated by fears. Alleviating those fears and opening up opportunities will be the target of our project. At the same time we aim to concrete awareness of opportunities in a European context, to motivate and encourage students to see the bigger picture within the European structures so as to enable them to use these structures to their own advantage. It's important for us to enhance our students' opportunities both with respect to the job market in Europe and in their personal lives. Personal well-being and feeling content in your life depends a lot on work-life-balance. How can this be achieved in an ever-increasingly demanding environment? We intend to explore strategies and techniques, such as response groups regarding language development and interactive workshops to practise public appearance skills, to achieve these aims with our students thus opening new avenues of experience for all those taking part. These insights will be passed on to peer groups, parents and all others who are either interested in the development of these young people or in furthering and differentiating their own skills. The countries working together in order to learn from each other are: Sweden, Germany, Great Britain, Poland and Macedonia. They will contribute all their expertise in fields such as career guidance, work experience, entrepreneurship, communicative skills, usage of media and ICT, language improvement, work-life-balance and intercultural skills. There will be workshops on the topics mentioned, at the same time enhancing students' motivation and creativity thus encouraging personal development. Student participation in the workshops with the acnowledged \u201dEuropass\u201d can be used as a valuable tool for future career decisions.

A total of 300 participating students will benefit from this project, including a balance of both genders, ethnic groups, and students with learning disabilities. The results of these meetings will be distributed in the respective schools. These results will be made accessible on a local, regional and international scale by publishing products on the eTwinning-platform, a specially designed joint blog, and in our respective local and regional networks.
