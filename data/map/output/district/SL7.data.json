We will develop C-ITS cloud based smart visibility software to support the re-engineering of the networks, improving real-time utilization of transport assets. NEXTRUST will focus on research activities that create stickiness for collaboration in the market, validated through pilot cases in live conditions.

The students will be working in 14 companies of the high standard hotel sector in the areas service, kitchen, housekeeping and /or reception (5 students in France, 14 in Italy, 5 in Ireland and 2 in England). In all partner firms experienced and supportive contact persons are available for the students as well as the teachers of our school.\r\nA main emphasis of education for the Bezauer Wirtschaftsschulen lies in improving and deepening language skills of the foreign languages English, French, Italian and Spanish. A further ambition of our education is to offer our students the chance to gain work experience abroad. Unfortunately, work placements abroad are poorly paid. Therefore, we want to support our students being able to cover costs by applying for Erasmus+ \u201cLernmobilit\u00e4t von Einzelpersonen\u201d. This experience abroad offers our students, among other things, following advantages: improving and perfecting their language skills, learning and applying special terminology, being able to work as part of a team, the completion and advancement of practical skills in kitchen, service and reception, putting learned matters into practice, encourage students to work in a self-reliant and responsible manner, strengthening their personality, gaining advantages for future job applications due to practical experience abroad, acquiring open-mindedness and tolerance towards other cultures and mentality, and much more.\r\nOur school is located in the tourism area Bregenzerwald (Vorarlberg, in the west of Austria). As tourism is a principal source of income respectively a very important field of employment for this region, a profound education in service, kitchen and reception as well as in tourism- and leisure time management is of great significance. Moreover, an intensive training in languages (English, French, Italian and Spanish) resulting from the international clientele and the special geographic location of Vorarlberg, lying in a region where three countries meet (Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Lichtenstein), is of immense importance. The participants of this project are basically for the first time for a longer time in a foreign country. They have the great opportunity to practise foreign languages in real life situations, being in contact with native speakers, and with it deepening their knowledge and at the same time getting acquainted with international know-how.\r\nAustria is an important tourist destination. Years back German speaking guests were absolutely dominant, however, this has strongly changed in the last years to guests from all over the world. An important growth market is without any doubt North Italy, but also France, Spain and English speaking countries play an important role in the mixture of our tourists. Consequently, the Austrian tourism industry demands of the graduates of a Secondary College for Tourism profound knowledge in foreign languages as well as excellent subject-specific qualifications.", "http://www.danesfieldhouse.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT01-KA102-004738_9"]]}}, "2LS": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "MAV", "European Management Education & Learning (e-mel) LLP", 249003.0, 7, 7, "The project \u201cMultidimensional training of adult volunteers to foster migrants' integration\u201d (MAV) is strongly committed to achieve \"take-up and effective outreach\" of the targeted migrants: the conceptual orientation of the project is based on integration to be promoted through involvement of migrant volunteers acting as mentors of other migrants. \"Guidance and motivation strategies\" are yet conceived as relevant objetives in order to achieve integration in a smooth but immediately effective manner, to stimulate the migrant volunteers to become propagators of the awareness, soft skills and comptences lernt within their wider migrants' communities. The method choosen strategically combines into an integrated learning package traditional approaches with innovative motivation and guidance tools, to ensure the migrants volunteers' interest, hence the propagation of the benefits of the MAV adult learning via these migrant volunteers to other migrants.\r\nIn this way, MAV will directly contribute to enhance the achievement of migrants integration, in the meanwhile promoting the sustainability of the project behind its completion.\r\n\r\nMAV is focused on volunteers who serve as \"mentors\" for other migrants (including refugees, third country national and non native in general) in order to better guide them into the European labor market, help them to identify and improve their skills and competences, continue to build upon the training which they might have had in their countries of origin.\r\nWe will create a form of learning tool kit for adult volunteers (especially adult migrants in volunteering) to better self-train and qualify volunteers to manage for \"their migrants\" the transition process between \"arriving as migrants\" up to integrating into the local labor market of the receiving country, in this way contributing to the enhancement of more inclusive societies.\r\nIn particular, the project is implemented in the seven project countries Germany, Italy, Romania, Greece, United Kingdom, Cyprus and Turkey by seven expert entities sharing different but complementary focus areas, which will carry out a demonstrative learning of volunteers to promote their engagement in becoming mentors and facilitators of other migrants as further users of the \"lesson lernt\". \r\nThis will create in time a propagation effect of benefits  that will broadly extend in time the impact envisaged along the implementation of the project, which is therefore already of great relevance for the project countries.\r\n\r\nMAV conceives integration as opportunity offered to migrant volunteers to improve their own employability and then promote the employability of other migrants. Integration is seen as an evolutionary system of relationships among migrants themselves -, related to choice, needs and capacity of networking, and not only as static combination of individual situations.\r\nWithin this conceptual orientation, MAV integrates relevant considerations in the field in a comprehensive and multidimensional approach, and expects to achieve the following results.\r\n(1) During the project:\r\n- to involve directly a total amount of 510 key players in the project countries to participating to the project implementation \r\n(70 trainers and professionals working with volunteering as groups of experts consulted , 140 migrants  \u2013 especially women and women with children, testing the MAV outputs, and 300 stakeholders in the receiving communities attending the eight multiplier events organized by the partners in each project country); \r\n- to implement the MAV communications toolkit as package of learning modules and resources to improve adult learners soft skills and competences (validated thorough through users' assessment), with minimum 1000 registered users to the MAV virtual community before the end of the project.\r\n(2) After the completion of the project:\r\n- To put on place the MAV framework and specific methodology, carefully designed to the scope of expanding in time far beyond the duration of the action, and from Germany, the project countries and other European countries in the partners' networks, to the overall Union.\r\n- To have created a broad consensus and interest to the MAV concept of migrant volunteers as multiplier and propagators of migrants' integration.", "http://www.e-mel.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA204-004284_1"]]}}}}
