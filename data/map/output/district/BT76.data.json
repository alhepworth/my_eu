A vital indicator of adult learning success is the ability to develop new skills and interest for lifelong learning. There are high levels of unemployment for women and each of the four partners have developed successful methods and tools to provide support to women return to work. This project will exchange these best practices and methods across the key areas of expertise for women: Supporting Disability; Mentoring and support; Personal and professional development, Entrepreneurship and networks for women to extend and develop the educators' competences to meet the needs of women especially migrant, refugee and disabled women. In line with the Commission's 'Vocational education and training by exploring methods and tools to meet the needs of the target groups the project addresses one of the key European Commission Communication Priorities for 2016 to boost for jobs, growth and investment to encourage economic growth. One of the main goals of the Europe 2020 strategy: smart, sustainable, all-embracing growth, is that 75% of the population of working age should be in employment in the year 2020. For this to become a reality we must increase women's participation in the labour markets across all the EU.  This project will improve levels of employment by supporting underrepresented groups; women and more specifically migrants and refugees who represent an important pool of employment potential including entrepreneurship to meet the aims of The Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan by creating an environment where entrepreneurs can flourish for groups who are not reached by traditional outreach for business support. The innovative aspect is not only assisting women return to work but also focusing on the issues the very recent refugee crisis has on each partner region and how we can learn from each other to respond to and address the needs of migrant and refugee women to also assist them return to work. The project objectives are to:- Share best practice expertise to exchange ideas, to develop, adapt and transfer new methods and tools between partner regions   to support women develop skills and competencies to return to work- Disseminate this best practice to key stakeholders and educators involved in supporting women return to work to develop   educators competences and to improve the delivery and support available to women - Empower women through practical and theoretical methods to build confidence, develop skills and competencies and identify   career paths to return to work- Create a flexible movement of the labour market regionally, in the EU and Internationally- Promote peer learning to develop capacity - Create a sustainable network between project partners to share best practice to extend beyond the partner regions for   wider EU and International benefit. Each partner will host a Transnational Meeting in their region which will include partners and key stakeholders. Each Meeting will include a Project Meeting as well as a Best Practice Meeting with Presentations, Workshops and Study visits related to the host specific area of expertise: Sweden Mentoring; UK Entrepreneurship & Networks; Poland Working after Parenthood and Disability; Turkey Personal and Professional Development and Refugee women. Each meeting will last 3 days except Turkey which will last 4 days to include the final conference to share best practice. After each meeting a report of the best practice will be shared through newsletters, a specific project page on each partners\u2019 websites.  The project will: Encourage women in the labour force in EU will contribute to economical growth; Share knowledge between regions to share ways to support migrant and refugee women; Diversity of partners will lead to more innovative best practices explored between regions to support women returning to work; Enable collaboration and dissemination with a wider group of actors across sectors at local, regional, national and European level- The transnational dimension has an important multiplier effect, since it can strengthen the capacity to innovate, modernize and   adapt to social and economical challenges. This leads to attitude change not only by women but also for stakeholders and the labour market.", "http://www.eurolink-eu.net", null, "erasmus_2016-1-SE01-KA204-022066_2"], [2017, "Youth Making a Difference in Europe", "The Rural Centre", 35550.0, 7, 7, "The project Youth MADE (Making a Difference in Europe) will support marginalised young people participate in youth exchanges to explore migration, refugees, integration and inclusion, to they can share different cultural views and in so doing develop informed opinions and gain respect and tolerance for diversity.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n- to work with marginalised youth with economic, social and educational difficulties and engage them in all stages of the project\r\n- for young people to be informed on migration, refugees, integration and inclusion and aware of different social, cultural, educational, economic and political realities \r\n- to share different cultural views and propose actions to promote the values of solidarity, democracy and respect for human rights to prevent fear of others and radicalisation\r\n- to encourage young people to engage in the democratic process\r\n- to encourage youth to participate in more international activities to develop their cultural awareness \r\n- to share the results of their activities through multi media reports online\r\n\r\nThe project partners are: Croatia, France, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden and the UK. \r\n\r\nThe Youth MADE project will work with youth aged 13 to 30 from marginalised rural areas with economic, social and educational difficulties and involve them in all stages of the project to secure their engagement.
