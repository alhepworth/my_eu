Training young people through WBL represents an important tool to react in a flexible, efficient and concrete way to the needs of the company. In-company trainers responsible for training/mentoring learners benefit by developing their skills and competences as trainers but also by developing new knowledge, since learners bring new perspectives and challenges as they learn. \r\n\r\nCompared to large companies, many SMEs have a less advanced training culture and limited training budgets. Very frequently, in-company trainers have not been properly trained, not on specific teaching techniques for WBL, not on how to prepare, organize and manage the participation of the company in an apprenticeship programme, creating some times stress, insecurity and a feeling of burden in the SME\u00b4s staff. It is also important to train in-company trainers on how to strike the right balance between the company-specific skill needs of the employer and the general employability of the apprentice.\r\n\r\nThere are many possibilities to alleviate such problems either by training alliances or by external training centres. VET schools, training providers and intermediary bodies may play a key role in helping SMEs, and experience shows a proactive training provider is a key to success. \r\n\r\nThe aim of APP & TEACH project is to facilitate the participation of SMEs in apprenticeship by equipping in-company VET trainers with the necessary skills and innovative ICT-based tools to support both the management and the training activities involved in apprenticeship programs. To do so, an alliance of VET experts and providers, companies and intermediary bodies from 8 countries (8 countries (Austria, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and United Kingdom) will work together to lead the project and co-create and test the following innovative methods and freely accessible OER:\r\n- A European ECVET Curriculum (IO1) and a set of Training Modules (IO2) on Management of Apprenticeships for SMEs. \r\n- An innovative Mobile Instructional Learning APPs (IO3) designed to train teachers and educators from VET schools, training providers and intermediary bodies to use and design multi-level Mobile Learning APPs.\r\n- A Multilingual e-learning platform (IO4), with innovative e-Learning courses and OER on Management of Apprenticeships for SMEs.\r\n- A Guide for validation, certification & accreditation (IO5) of Management of Apprenticeships for SMEs in Europe. \r\n\r\nTeachers and educators from VET schools, training providers and intermediary bodies and in-company trainers are the main target users of the project products and in-company trainers are also the final beneficiaries. During the life time of APP & TEACH project, the partnership will directly involve 110 teachers, trainers, and educators from VET schools, training providers and intermediary bodies (32 partners staff / 48 experts involved / 30 target users in pilots), 150 in-company trainers (in pilots) and 550 stakeholders. A wider audience, of a minimum of 1000 recipients, will be reached at local, regional, national and European level through the planned dissemination activities.\r\n\r\nThe project will apply European frameworks and instruments, like EQF, ECVET, EQAVET, Europass and EPALE, to promote and boost transparency and recognition of competences and qualifications, transnational mobility and the transferability of the project outputs to other VET experts and providers, companies and intermediary bodies at local, regional, national and European level, with the active support and cooperation of a network of key associated partners and relevant stakeholders involved in the project.   \r\n\r\nAPP & TEACH will have a direct impact on in-company trainers facilitating the participation of SMEs in apprenticeship and on the ICT-based teaching skills of teachers and educators from VET schools, training providers and intermediary bodies and also of in-company trainers.

The aim of the 2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage is to encourage more people to discover and engage with Europe's cultural heritage, and to reinforce a sense of belonging to a common European space. \r\n\r\nWith a starting point in the archives and cultural heritage across Europe\u2019s post-industrial communities, specifically using five archives from Dornbirn (AT), Wuppertal (DE), Osijek (HR), Torres Novas (PT) and Coventry (UK),  and the adulte educational skills of all the partners the project VIRAL aims to enrich the key competences of adults facing fewer opportunities through new adult education program for using virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and 360-degree movies (360) technology tools and documentary methods.  Across Europe, post-industrial heritage sites have been the centre of their local community for 10s or 100s of years. Often everyone had a friend, a neighbour or knew someone that worked in the factory, mine, harbour or agricultural practice etc. A working-class neighbourhood often grew up around it; maybe there was a kindergarten/school in the factory; the industry concerned imposed a rhythm and style on the community. This is a phenomenon common to the whole of Europe. The factory may have closed, the machines may have gone, maybe the buildings have been demolished, but the stories, can still be collected, listened to, recorded and retold.  This special relationship can be used in Adult Education to build bridges over social, gender, ethnic and age ethnical gaps and different social classes.\r\n\r\nNowadays, EU societies and economies are experiencing significant digital and technological innovations as well as labour market and demographic changes. Old professions, such those factory jobs mentioned above, no longer exist; many of today's jobs did not exist a decade ago; and many new forms of employment will be created in the future. Without these skills many are at higher risk of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, particularly among adults already facing fewer opportunities. The new Commission \u201cRecommendation on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning\u201d (2018) are: - STEM; - languages; - digital competences; - literacy; - cultural awareness and expression; -  entrepreneurship; - civic; and - personal, social and learning. \r\n\r\nThe VIRAL project will target 3 groups and address the following needs:\r\n1) Adults facing fewer opportunities such as economic (e.g., ex-workers at post-industrial sites, long-term unemployment) and educational (low-skilled and/or low-qualified) obstacles, with the need to develop new key competences to be better prepare them for changing labour markets and active citizenship in more diverse, mobile, digital and global societies, and raising awareness of how their cultural heritage can be a vehicle for lifelong learning;\r\n2) Adult educators lacking heritage education skills and technical competence in how to use VR/AR/360 in training; \r\n3) Professionals in adult education department within cultural heritage lacking informal, non/formal and andragogic skills and technical in how to use VR/AR/360 in cultural and/or learning environments.\r\nThe project VIIRAL will supply high quality individual learning  oppurtunities for adults and competence development for adult educators in the fields of Virtual, Augmented and 360 video Reality production. This will be carried out in the context of utilising archive material and the physical places and environments of post- industrial landscapes. We will exploit the often deep interest for the individuals local environment by exploring old industrial factories, mines, harbours, agricultural production centres that once stood at the centre of local communities but are now long gone. Investigating a heritage site  is an excellent way of exploring cross-curricular themes in adult education and developing key concepts, competences and processes. \r\n\r\nThe Outputs of the project will be:\r\n1.

Migrants from third countries account for around four percent of the total EU population, according to the European Commission. Europe is confronted with an ageing population and a shrinking workforce \u2013 which will lead to labour and skills shortages that will challenge economic growth prospects. Consequently countries that make the best use of their migrant population have the best prospects to develop.Many migrants arrive in Europe from third countries or travel from country to country within Europe with complete, partial or initial levels of Vocational Education Training including professionals and trades people often with skills in demand in the host country. The final goal of this project is to train the trainiers (VETPROS) of migrants.

This includes people who are more specially disadvantaged because of certain social or individual learning disabilities. Since the arts and cultural sector became an independent topic with the signing of Maastricht Treaty in 1993 the sector has grown significantly in its influence and extent.

The present-day labour market in Europe calls for constant updating of knowledge and professional skills and the European Union states that lifelong learning is essential for everyone.

From the effects of the radicalization and the extremism, to the crisis of the refugees and the asylum seekers or the discrimination of some migrant communities, the question about how to foster the social cohesion and to fight against discrimination is in the middle of the debates in an increasingly culturally diversified Europe.Religion has come to a prime site in the cultural and social conflict, but religion is only one aspect among a range of factors which make migrants and ethnic minorities appear different. Policymakers throughout Europe feel increasing pressure to adopt more effective approaches to secure inclusion but are uncertain how to bring people together to achieve this. Ensuring inclusive education for all children and young people and empowering teachers so that they are able to take an active stand against all forms of discrimination and racism, are among the recommendations made by the European Commission.Religious and moral values area highly sensitive area. The religious dimension of intercultural education and intercultural education itself require specific kinds of teaching and learning approaches. Unlike some traditional approaches to intercultural education, these methods focus not on the link between the dominant culture and minority cultures, but instead on learning to live together. Therefore, the teaching approaches must be coherent with this specific reality and requires specific methods and tools. Young people are a particularly vulnerable group. Young newcomers (refugees, asylum seekers and migrants) should also get access to intercultural education and benefit from the acquisition of social, civic and intercultural competences, independently of the educational programme in which the may be enroll.

Different studies show that people with disabilities are at a significant higher risk of experiencing sexual violence than people of the same age without disabilities. This is amongst others due to a lack of sexual education for people with mental disabilities (see i.a. WHO World Report on Disability (2011)). Without sexual education people with mental disabilities often lack expressions to talk about assaults as well as the ability for sexual self-determination. The majority of professionals working with people with disabilities have not been trained to talk about sexuality or even to acknowledge the sexual and reproductive rights and needs of their clients.\r\n\r\nTo improve this situation the LLP Grundtvig project SEAD created a tool kit for sexual education for people with mental disabilities.

The metaphor employed is \u2018to start with an new business idea in the morning and have all required data and networks understood by the afternoon\u2019\n\nTo achieve this FLEXINET takes the view that new product-service global production network modelling methods and models are needed that can model business cases and identify the critical network relations and knowledge that underlies the business operation. In addition, FLEXINET takes the fundamental view that complex manufacturing systems which involve multiple partners and multiple complex network constraints,  require a semantically rigorous formal foundation upon which to base the flexible re-configuration of global production networks.\n\nBased on the exploitation of these technologies, FLEXINET will deliver a set of configuration services for flexible network design, applicable to both OEMs and SMEs, that will enable 'what-if' comparisons of costs, risks, configuration evaluations and product-service compliance requirements for alternative production network designs. FLEXINET will achieve this aim by working with its industrial partners from the industrial pump, white goods and food sectors and exploiting the world leading expertise of its partners in business modelling, business evaluation methods, risk management, manufacturing semantics, manufacturing knowledge sharing, manufacturing eco-systems, product-service systems, SME collaboration, SOA, Interoperability and standardisation.'", 289008.0, 3995087.0, 6, 14, "FLEXINET", null, "http://www.coventry.ac.uk", null, "fp7_108887_999612161"], [1496275200000, 1622419200000, "Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) System for the Inspection of Operation-Induced Material Degradation in Nuclear Power Plants", "Coventry University", "The long-term operation (LTO) of existing nuclear power plants (NPPs) has already been accepted in many countries as a strategic objective to ensure adequate supply of electricity over the coming decades.

For many, the perception and reality of public transport does not encourage use, especially when multimodal forms of transport are needed. A holistic understanding of passenger experience is critical to develop and support transport accessibility. Whilst previous research has focussed on different aspects of passenger experience, the diversity of tools developed limits their usefulness, effectiveness and transferability.

In particular, the research accompanying the Opening Up Education communication found that 50%-80% of students in EU countries never use digital textbooks, exercise software, simulations or learning games, that most teachers at primary and secondary level do not consider themselves as 'digitally confident' or able to teach digital skills effectively, and that 70% would like more training in using ICTs. In parallel, within Higher Education, the emergence of Massively Online Open Courses (MOOCs) and other innovative methodologies are increasing the demand for digital learning opportunities. The demand for such opportunities is increased further by its contribution to lifelong learning, with students asking for customisable and flexible study experiences which can be taken along with working responsibilities. In the meantime, despite increasing demand, Europe is suffering from an acute lack of skills within its teaching population to develop digital educational resources and to design ICT-enabled learning experiences.

Across Europe, post-industrial heritage sites have been the centre of their local community for 10s or 100s of years. Often everyone had a friend, a neighbour or knew someone that worked in the factory, mine, harbour or agricultural practice etc. A working-class neighbourhood often grew up around it; maybe there was a kindergarten/school in the factory; the industry concerned imposed a rhythm and style on the community. This is a phenomenon common to the whole of Europe. The factory may have closed, the machines may have gone, maybe the buildings have been demolished, but the stories, can still be collected, listened to, recorded and retold.  This special relationship can be used in Adult Education to build bridges over social, gender, ethnic and age ethnical gaps and different social classes.\r\n\r\nNowadays, EU societies and economies are experiencing significant digital and technological innovations as well as labour market and demographic changes. Old professions, such those factory jobs mentioned above, no longer exist; many of today's jobs did not exist a decade ago; and many new forms of employment will be created in the future. Without these skills many are at higher risk of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, particularly among adults already facing fewer opportunities.

START IN project will directly involve 104 school teachers and educators (32 partners staff / 42 experts involved / 30 target users in pilots), 150 school students (in pilots) and 495 stakeholders. A wider audience, of a minimum of 1000 recipients, will be reached at local, regional, national and European level through the planned dissemination activities.\r\nThe project will apply European frameworks and instruments, like EQF, Europass and SchoolEducationGateaway, to promote and boost transparency and recognition of competences and qualifications, transnational mobility and the transferability of the project outputs to other local and regional school authorities, Universities and learning provider organizations at local, regional, national and European level, with the active support and cooperation of a network of key associated partners and relevant stakeholders involved in the project.   \r\n\r\nSTART IN will have a direct impact on school teachers, reducing the digital gap between educators and students, and improving learning and teaching practises, also through ICT, combining social innovation and social entrepreneurship in School education. The project will have a direct impact on students, improving their social innovation skills and their social entrepreneurial mindset.

The overarching problem identified is that students with various disorders in contrast to identifying a single static primarily brain-based deficit, are increasingly perceived as out of sync with their internal and external environments experiencing difficulties to enable operations from their peripheral nervous systems.  The noisiness that seems to occur in both spectrums of the neural flow cause profound dysfunctionality related to rhythm and timing of movement which has direct implications in the way certain types of students with special needs communicate, interact with their social surroundings and sensory system such as vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell and balance. Evidently, to provide research-informed and applicable solutions to this problem, the role of rhythm and timing in helping certain types of students to reduce overload and to create a symmetry to their sensory system which in turn may amplify their learning skills, capabilities and competencies has a significant potential and can lead to innovative approaches to foster inclusion in classrooms with students with and without Special Education Needs. This potential can be linked to music and dance, as the two major art forms that are directly related to rhythm and need synchronization between different body parts and multiple sensory inputs. By employing music and dance to design and implement creative learning interventions, students actively explore and make sense of their environment by embedding rhythm into social interactions which are rich in figures and context.\r\n\r\nTo explore this potential of rhythm in promoting inclusion in European schools, the rhythm4inclusion project will first identify the needs and requirements of teachers that are confronted with the task to address the needs of students with and without special needs co-existing in the same class, identify the innovative elements that can be brought in these situations by integrating music and dance, develop a rhythm-based inclusion curriculum combined with a digital competences framework for teachers. This last element aims at developing skills and competences that will allow teachers to explore modern digital technologies to collaborate with the colleagues as well as with distant psych-pedagogy experts and document their practices either to share and reuse them or to receive valuable feedback from special education experts.\r\n\r\nThe project supports teachers in their path to integrating arts for fostering inclusion by\r\nprimarily piloting of the project (2nd project year) and the creation and delivery of the online training programme (3rd project year).  The training programme will enable teachers across Europe to embed multi-arts into their daily teaching to teach curricular subjects and foster social inclusion. Through the piloting and training programme, teachers with no artistic training will be enabled to use the arts and overcome obstacles deriving from inhibitions and sense of inadequacy towards their own artistic abilities. They will gain knowledge of a method with innovative and successful practices to use with their students.\r\n\r\nThe Online Training Programme will consist into several parts, dedicated to selected art forms for rhythm-based learning interventions (music and dance), parts dedicated to the psycho-pedagogical framework that is necessary to understand how the proposed learning interventions should be designed, supported and evaluated, and parts that dedicated to the acquisition of important digital competencies that will allow teachers to exploit digital technologies in order to participate actively in communities of practice, document their work, share their experiences and find new professional development opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe final project outputs in terms of rhythm-based inclusion curriculum, teacher training materials and teachers\u2019 Community of Practice, all supported by a modern eLearning platform enabling its widest possible use will be used by school teachers facing serious difficulties in their work with disruptive or problematic and disordered students with the provision of clear and concise guidelines and techniques, as well as information on the implementation and evaluation process.

The quality of having acquired sufficient entrepreneurial awareness and skills would substantially  improve the flexibility and mobility of graduates of secondary VET for future construction professions. However, not everybody possesses the competence to achieve success as an entrepreneur, and furthermore these skills appear hard if not impossible to learn by more traditional training methods.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nMost effective approaches to develop entrepreneurship skills involve experiential and task-oriented learning from real business problems. The TYCON project proposes serious games as powerful didactical means for the acquisition of entrepreneurial competences for professional life in a changing and complex society. These learning benefits are enabled by the highly experiential, immersive, just-in-time and contextual nature of realistic gameplay based on high quality instructional design of learning scenarios.  This pedagogically-founded and dedicated TYCON game (innovative key value 1) will be developed and provided in an integrated VET context with well thought-out training materials (innovative key value 2) and evaluation rubrics, that are to be derived from an accreditated and dedicated assessment framework (innovative key value 3). These conditions will guarantee broader uptake and sustainable use of these learning materials.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nThe project aims to deliver an integrated set of online/mobile serious mini-games (the TYCOONSTRUCTOR game) by using the metaphor of a virtual internship that would allow VET students (at 4th EQF qualification level) in construction to discover and explore important facets of entrepreneurship in context. Besides these students, other stakeholders targeted are: VET institutions/centres, local public bodies relevant for qualifications and VET, current students or apprentices, workers, companies, trainers, teacher trainers, professional colleagues, business entrepreneurs and social agents.  Project partners, throughout several partnership projects, have developed a collection of high quality ICT applications that have showed their usefulness as a didactical resource to teach especially young workers from the building industry.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nBesides generic project outcomes, the main Intellectual Outputs will be composed thus:\r\nIO1-Assessment framework entrepreneurial skills (lead: Coventry)\r\nIO2: Case leads and context information (lead: CEAP)\r\nIO3: Game design and pedagogical scenario (lead: WHTK)\r\nIO4: Game development and implementation (lead: OUNL)\r\nIO5: Pilot testing and dissemination (lead: CCIS)\r\nIO6: Development training materials (lead: BZB)\r\nIO7: Impact assurance and evaluation (Lead: FCL)\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe 4C-/ID model is applied for designing professional \"whole tasks', the EMERGO approach for designing the game elements, and the AR Learn platform for the agile prototyping and development of the mobile mini-games, methods proven and developed by the lead partner.

ENAI will be focused not only on HEI students and their teachers (our main target group), but on whole academia (professors, post-docs, PhD, administration staff and management, including academic ethics committees, etc.) and future HEI students (high school students) and their teachers. It means that ENAI will address such misbehavior in academia as cheating, plagiarism, scientific misconduct, mobbing (bullying), and so on. One unifying and international body representing interests of many institutions all over the Europe could be also a great advantage in potential negotiations on higher levels. For now there are 12 core partners across Europe (project consortium) of which 11 represent universities. But many others claimed their readiness for future cooperation under ENAI platform.

The project activities to reach these outputs are based on qualitative research in particular countries when researchers investigate country specifics and examples of best practice. Then they are working together at joint training events. Moreover there will be held an international conference every year where other stakeholders can discuss the project outcomes and give us such necessary feedback.European Network for Academic Integrity (referred as ENAI platform) will be a consortium of HEIs and other relevant stakeholders which will share their experience and best practices in the field of academic integrity.

The aim of the PAHA project was to demonstrate if a 6-week intervention of structured exercise, exercise counselling and behavioural change support, is effective in increasing physical activity levels in previously self-perceived inactive individuals (55-65 year old). Measurements were taken at the start, the number of completions of the 6-week trial recorded, and then at subsequent 3 months interval. From the 669 people who took part in the trials a significant majority of 89% completed the full six weeks. The results show that 70% of the participants still exercising to the benefit of their health 3 months after they completed their 6-week trial sessions.  Finally, we can say that the project has succeeded in its principle objective in showing that it is possible by a structured intervention programme, counselling and behavourial support to increase the physical activity level of previously self-perceived inactive individuals (55-65 year olds).

Local authorities are currently struggling with budget cut-downs in the welfare sector, mainly due to consequenses of the hardly ended worldwide financial crisis. As a response to the need for re-organisation, co-creation has started to become an acknowledged concept to create a more sustainable set-up and organisation of the welfare sector. Introducing co-creation as a new method to develop and implement welfare solutions, will challenge old structures and all stakeholders must redefine themselves in this new collaboration concept. The traditional linear planning will be dropped in order to give more room for common identification of challenges and possible solutions through brainstorming, creativity and impulsive ideas. This calls for a new approach of preparing and training the professional practitioners working within health and social care, welfare, education and youth. In order to prepare and manage local co-creation processes, professional practitioners will need to learn how to become multidisciplinary process facilitators instead of \u201cjust\u201d being a civil servant doing \u201ccaseworking\u201d based on clear guidelines. The purpose of the project is to develop, test and propose efficient ways of implementation of a common European set of training materials, which will assist professional practitioners on local level around Europe, to qualify themselves to carry out co-creation processes on local level, which can push forward the needed re-organisation and effectiveness of the public welfare sector.

It will improve the overall provision of teaching, learning and training within the peacebuilding industry by bringing together providers from the formal education (FE) and non-formal education (NFE) sectors in a community of practice. These partners will investigate current deficits, weaknesses and missed opportunities in educational provision across the field, addressing these with innovative tools for learners, as well as tools and mechanisms for learning providers to facilitate cross-sectoral working.Peacebuilding is now a multi-billion Euro industry with a global infrastructure, reflecting the acute need to address conflict and insecurity and growing confidence that doing so is possible, particularly with new technologies. The increase in peacebuilding has spurred growth in education and training, as practitioners need applied skills and knowledge. However much of the current provision is offered piecemeal, disconnected from other relevant learning opportunities. Collaboration between learning providers is challenged by differences in pedagogical perspective, underpinning ethos and teaching methodology. There is no clear guidance for learners on the skills and competencies they should acquire and no easy way for them to combine courses strategically. There has also been little systemic reflection on the benefits and limitations of online and distance learning in peacebuilding, although learning providers use them a lot. The main objective of BUILDPEACE is to enable innovative new approaches to developing peacebuilders by: 1) creating a common framework of key competencies across the FE and NFE sectors; 2) helping learners find navigable and flexible pathways for accessing relevant learning opportunities;  3) blending FE and NFE learning approaches for more comprehensive provision, making use of technology. To do this we will bring together European partners with experience in improving the learning outcomes of peacebuilders. Our activities will help us better understand the current state education provision within the peacebuilding field and develop innovative ways to improve learning outcomes using new methodologies and technologies. This will inform the creation of a range of tools for learners and learning providers to use, including free online courses, a handbook, a toolkit and a matrix of the competencies that people need to acquire to work in the field. Tools for policymakers include a mapping report and a policy recommendations report. To test these ideas and tools participants and learners will take part in two BUILDPEACE Workshops. These will pilot and improve the BUILDPEACE approach. Participants will deliver educational content to learners using the methods, modes of delivery and tools that the project experiments with. The workshops will be action oriented, participatory and engaging. The results of the project will be an improvement in the educational provisional available to people working on peace and conflict issues. Learners will have access to comprehensive, rigorously tested resources such as online courses and advice on the competencies and skills they need to develop.  Learning providers will have access to resources so that teachers and trainers can improve their own skills, especially by using new methods and making use of technology.

Many VET teachers and trainers lack digital competences and are not sufficiently prepared to cope with other needs and expectations of the new generations of apprentices. The apprentices themselves lack motivation, self-esteem, communication skills. Various forms of bullying including cyber bullying among apprentices have reached the VET sector. The VET systems as a whole are not responsive enough to labour market needs. \r\n\r\nThe project aims at enhancing the skills and competences  of apprenticeship trainers and teachers and trainers of other VET systems, by developing training materials which provide guidance on how to cope successfully with the Generation Y and how to communicate corporate culture and values. \r\n\r\nThe course content covers five subject areas:\r\n\r\n- How to find and develop apprentices\r\n- Leadership and working with generation Y\r\n- Knowledge transfer to generation Y\r\n- Leadership and corporate culture\r\n- Conflict resolution in VET\r\n\r\nThe course content is developed in MicroLearning format. The content of a course consists of 20 to 25 video clips of 1-3 minutes\u2019 duration, the same number of audio clips and so-called transfer materials (e.g. guidelines for trainers, check-lists; links for download materials). The course content will be developed in DE, EN, FR and PL language. \r\n\r\nMicroLearnings are digital flash cards which are accessible at any time from any device. This innovative and learner-centred method of learning has become increasingly popular in recent years especially in big companies. Mobile and flexible educational methods take into account both the needs of in-company-trainers as time resources for education and training are becoming more limited and of the apprentices who by using digital learning formats achieve better learning results and a higher degree of satisfaction and retention.  Learning in MicroLearning format thus helps to reduce the number of early apprenticeship leavers, to increase the labour market relevance of VET and to make apprenticeships more attractive and efficient.\r\n\r\nThe Consortium is composed of 5 organisations from four countries (AT, FR, PL and UK) providing training or training-related services at VET or university level.

Initial research revealed a dominant discourse where digital media was conceived as a set of tools to acquire and represent information; or as a place to use games to practice skills.\r\nWe challenge this view and will develop teaching methods and learning strategies that use digital media as part of a multi-disciplinary approach involving communication, mathematics and science, humanities, social and civic competence, cultural awareness and creative expression supported, enriched and made visible to others using digital media. It will become part of the everyday life of Pre-School.\r\nThis project is part of a professional development alliance that started in 2011. The alliance is a network of 5 schools in the UK and 5 in Sweden who are developing curriculum using interdisciplinary projects with young children from 1 to 6 years old.\r\nOur core objectives are to develop new teaching methods:\r\n\u2022 developing environments in which digital media can be used alongside other materials and resources within flexible and inter-disciplinary approaches\r\n\u2022 that show how teachers can offer digital media to young children that promotes independence and creative outcomes\r\n\u2022 that can be readily shared across national contexts and used by educators in ECE and beyond into primary phases of school \r\n\u2022 that will be relevant when used with future digital \r\nThere are 10 school leaders of pedagogy, school administration and systems management, 20 teachers working in classrooms with children aged 1-6 yrs and 150 children and their families working directly in project.\r\nOur method is to agree a meta-project that has relevance for all children and exchange our observations of the children\u2019s learning and our reflections on the adults teaching, done though digital exchanges online (through the use of secure shared folders, blogs and social messaging).  These will be enhanced through face to face meetings and through transnational exchange and evaluated against DIGCOMP: A Framework for Developing and Understanding Digital Competence in Europe. \r\nOur outputs include a range of inspiring and informative on-line and hard copy resources in 2 written and spoken languages. \r\nThe project will challenge traditional ideals and ways of seeing learning referencing Delueze and Guttarri\u2019s Rhizome Theory, Bateson\u2019s The Pattern that Connects and Reggio Emilia\u2019s concept of 100 Languages.  These conceptual frameworks have influenced the development of pedagogy in each of the partner schools in both countries. \r\nThe project is conceived as a series of case studies which will draw upon semi-structured focus groups (identified shared network days and leadership meetings), personal reflective journals of each teacher, the documentation of process and shared analysis of pedagogical documentation produced within and as an outcome of the project.\r\nThe structure of the project invites international confrontation of multiple perspectives upon episodes of children\u2019s meaning-making in group contexts using digital media as a tool of creative expression and enquiry.  This shared analysis will identify the patterns of development in children and pedagogical practice that can be articulated and shared through the website, publishing, video and training materials and replicated in other ECE contexts and beyond into Primary phase.\r\nDuring the project we will be developing new pedagogies that exploit the potential of ICT which is a key issue addressed in the Communication on Rethinking Education (in particular, chapter 2.2), and the enhancement of digital competence which is one of the main pillars of the Digital Agenda for Europe [71], and also one of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives. \r\nWithin the participating schools digital resources of all types will be used during lessons by children to support learning as digital media to be a part of the everyday life of preschool as an expressive language to facilitate and support enquiry. \r\nTeachers will have increased complexity of understanding and increased confidence in using digital technologies in meaningful, necessary ways that support children\u2019s learning and communication and be able to train and mentor others within and beyond the participating school at a local, regional, national and international level. The new methods will be transferrable for use with different digital platforms and digital hardware.

This narrative will seemingly continue and managing migration flows will continue to be a challenge for all EU society.
