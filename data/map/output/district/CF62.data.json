Centers that promote educational excellence and the training of active and committed citizens.\r\n\r\nThat is why through our \"Thousand Cultures, One Europe\" project and in line with the \"Europe 2020\", \"ET2020\" strategies and the initial conclusions about the future \"Europe 2030\", we aim to promote quality education within an international framework, through an intelligent and integrating growth. We hope to unite people and cultures through research, innovation and creativity in education by proposing the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.- To contribute to the construction of a society in which the European Union plays a close and useful role for our students, promote social inclusion, and to advance the knowledge of its peoples and cultures.\r\n2.- To put in practice open and innovative methodologies that \"engadge\" the students by making them autonomous and motivated to the construction of their knowledge. In short, to encourage them to expand his academic training and not to drop-out the school system.\r\n3.- To encourage schools to be a true reference among the educational community to which they belong, to become places of encounter and social and cultural exchange, and allow teachers to enjoy innovating and educating the citizens of tomorrow.\r\n4.- To know the reasons for the European Union, how it was created, who has fought and who stands for it, thus increasing the knowledge of the most important persons in its history.\r\n5.- To progress in our journey towards educational excellence.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these objectives, the project partners have been selected after a mature process of analysis, coming from 6 European Union countries (Spain, United Kingdom, Poland, Lithuania, Italy and Czech Republic). They have an impeccable trajectory and count on highly qualified teachers with experience in Erasmus + and LLP projects.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, referring to the target groups of the project, our main audience is primary school students, as well as the entire school community surrounding the center, both adults and youth. These people, around 7000, need to feel again the illusion of belonging to the European Unionby promoting social inclusion and learning the traditions and cultures that are part of Europe. Therefore, the project wants to reach these people through educational innovation and interconnection of the school with the community that surrounds it. The population at risk of social exclusion, or disadvantaged in any form, is what we have identified as the potentially greatest beneficiaries of the project, which will also reach all students and families in a global way.\r\n\r\nFor this, the most important activities to be carried out are:\r\n- Monographs and global didactic units, which will revolve around the figure of relevant people linked to each of the partner countries and values such as creativity, imagination, innovation and effort.\r\n- Creation of a Comprehensive Teaching Project that is applicable to all students.\r\n- Creation, musealization and opening to the community of physical spaces treating about the European Union.\r\n- Sound composition, new technologies or creativity workshops.\r\n- Mobility activities of `ambassadors students\u00b4, promoting social inclusion while training also teachers in educational innovation.\r\n\r\nBoth the activities and the rest of the project will be managed through an analytical and critical methodology, focusing on quality control  and improvement processes, being based on a fluid, constant and open communication with the aim to ensure the maximum efficiency that favors the optimum development thereof.\r\n\r\nThanks to this, the impact we expect to achieve in all participants and target groups is:\r\n- The comprehensive methodological renewal among teachers, through INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES, which positively influence students, contributing to the reduction of dropout rates.\r\n- The increase of the feeling of Europeanism and of the values of the UNION, as well as of the conscience on the importance of the SOCIAL INCLUSION.\r\n- The support for the importance of ENGLISH as a common language.\r\n- The promotion of student AUTONOMY and development of the \"Learning to Learn\" competence.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we aim to contribute to a society in which innovation, motivation and education go hand in hand. A society in which the EUROPEAN UNION is the way to a quality education.

The strategy aims to create a sustainable, attractive and competitive region and give young people international competence, experience and shared responsibility. The region (approx. 500.000 inhabitants) faces challenges concerning climate and energy, sustainable development, access to a skilled and competent labour force, innovation and development in the economic sector. As school owner HCC has committed to use the schools as local resource centres for economic and local development (Regional Development programme 2013). HCC is continuously working to adapt education and training to fit the needs of the region, and to prevent early school leaving (dropouts) (Action Plan for Internationalisation in Education 2014). These objectives are to a large extent in correspondence with the EU\u2019s 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. HCC is using participation in Erasmus+ Mobility as a strategic tool to reach these objectives, in close cooperation with priority partners: Vocational education and training, private sector, local authorities and civil society. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objectives for the project are to strengthen the region with professional knowledge, skills and competences adapted to the needs in different sectors, develop prosperous local communities, and improve learning outcomes for pupils, increase recruitment, prevent early school leaving and raise awareness in VET schools for internationalisation \u201cat home\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants: 230 VET learners/staff, 56 accompanying persons and 138 adult education staff (professionals).\r\n\r\nHCC is the coordinator for the project and has extensive experience in project cooperation and management in different EU projects e.g. the Life Long Learning and Interreg programmes, and is well qualified to carry out this project. Coordination and quality management are based on strong and long term cooperation with sending, intermediate and receiving organisations in Hordaland and Europe. This involves communication and planning activities, project development, coordination and management, and dissemination of results. HCC encourages participants to focus on further development of the cooperation achieved in the mobilities.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this project VET learners will have the opportunity to experience daily work practices in European companies within different subjects e.g.: Building and construction, health care, social work, technology and industrial production, restaurant/hotel/food and maritime subjects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent groups of staff will exchange experiences, and meet European colleagues through placements, work experiences, internships and meetings. For staff and subjects like:\r\n\r\n-VET teachers: Technological subjects and design & craft.\r\n\r\n-Regional and local cross-sectorial partner groups with focus on entrepreneurship and VET: Sustainable local development, innovation and need for new competences in companies, maintenance of sports complexes, transport & communication, aquaculture, local handcraft, tourism, public health and health care services in the municipalities.  \r\n\r\n-Other professionals: Sustainable energy in buildings, healthcare, local food traditions and design & crafts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the project, HCC will use the following methodology:\r\n\r\n-Writing an application on behalf of participating organisations with a focus on European, regional and local needs and priorities\r\n\r\n-Coordination and management of the mobilities\r\n\r\n-Good relations with regional partners in Europe\r\n\r\n-Assisting VET schools and municipalities with project development, and to strengthen relations with their partners in Europe\r\n\r\n-Stimulating cross-sectorial and interdisciplinary European cooperation and interaction\r\n\r\n-Strong anchorage of the mobilities in the sending organisations\r\n\r\n-Arranging meetings preparing the participants for the mobilities\r\n\r\n-Focusing on reciprocal mobilities, experiences and best practices \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\n-International competence, and new knowledge and skills to be implemented in the participating organisations and regions\r\n\r\n-Increased VET recruitment and more motivated, international focused and self-empowered pupils (prevent drop-outs)\r\n\r\n-Strengthen cooperation and cross-sectorial approach to economic and sustainable local development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project has long term effects which contribute to reach the objectives for the participating partners.

Erasmus+ VET Mobility is one of the tools HCC make use of to meet challenges linked to restructuring, availability of qualified workers and provision of targeted professional training, as well as gaining a more knowledge-based workforce and business/industry. \r\n\r\nAccess to, and availability of knowledge and an adequate supply of qualified labour is a prerequisite for economic development and requires strategic competency-based policies. With its basis in the education system, the purpose of HCC's \"Regional Plan for Expertise and Labour\" (2017) is to provide the labour market and economy with required qualified and skilled labour. Attention is given to the correlation between the labour market and education and training, and cooperation between the two to align skills with labour market needs. \r\n\r\nThe Department of Education and Training\u2019s \"Plan for Competence Development 2016-2020\" is a steering document, which aims at ensuring competence building within upper secondary education. Its objective is to systematically renew and expand the professional and pedagogical competence and knowledge among teachers linking it to the pupils\u2019 and apprentices\u2019 education and training.\r\n\r\nBoth plans contribute to continuous quality development. Targeted and systematic focus on exchange and transfer of knowledge, as well as competence development will ensure that Hordaland has the right skills and competences for the future.\r\n\r\nThe mobility projects in this application emphasise systematic work and quality (mobilisation, implementation, follow-up, evaluation, mapping and the dissemination of good results). Attitudes, behaviour and intercultural understanding are key elements in reaching the goal of making the participants global citizens with sound knowledge of Europe and the world.\r\n\r\nAs internationalisation should be an integrated part of education and training and contribute to the overall quality of education, we work continuously to mobilise schools and training offices to participate in mobility projects. Quality mobility stays give pupils and apprentices the opportunity to acquire further professional knowledge, improve language skills, and create positive attitudes. Further, the mobility stays contribute to the development of transversal skills that will be important in a in a long-term competence development perspective. In this application, we have seen a tendency that companies wish to send their apprentices abroad to cover parts of the curricula that is difficult to complete at home.\r\n\r\nThis project give great importance to the development of cross-sectoral group staff mobilities aiming at strengthening innovative international cooperation across different sectors, fields and levels.\r\n\r\nIt is important to have close links between businesses, the educational sector, and regional/local administration to increase competence and innovation across sectors. Educational provision should be in line with regional needs and restructuring to green workplaces. This year, HCC has especially targeted tertiary VET schools for participation in the project. These projects will address themes such as developing quality tertiary VET, competence requirements for Ocean Space Technology, recent approval and start-up of a study programme about local food culture at Hjeltnes, and the development of a new study programme for alternative energy in collaboration with NCE Maritime Cleantech. These staff mobilities also provide opportunities to create a European network for potential future mobilities of tertiary VET students.\r\n\r\nHCC is applying for 47 mobility projects, which count 177 pupils and 17 apprentices from 13 different secondary VET schools and 7 training offices, and 64 accompanying persons. HCC is also applying for 15 mobility projects, which count 134 staff from various VET institutions, companies, municipalities, industry organisations and other regional development actors. The disciplines represented in this application include health care/social work, restaurant/hotel business, industrial technology, hairdressing, electricity/electronics, landscaping, and office administration. Mobility projects involving cooperation for increased quality of education/training have themes such as aggregate management, welfare technology and dementia care, solid wood, agro-gastronomy, tourism and destination development, recruitment, restructuring, microplastics and strengthening links between VET and the industry.\r\n\r\nAs a school owner, HCC is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the pupils participating in the mobility projects.

It is dedicated to vocational education and training in different levels and it is located in the Madrid region. Our school and teachers have experience in finding work placements since 1998. Furthermore, the school and the teachers have built along the years a wide network of almost 600 companies. Indeed, we have a trustworthy and long established relationship with those companies which have provided our school with many work placements for our students. Teachers in charge of the work placements are very reliable, communicative and very quick at solving problems. Moreover, they are used to work with companies and monitor students. Our teachers have the social skills needed in order to handle excellent work placements.\r\nBecause of our desire to improve in a European level, in 2012 a team work was created to carry out projects and in 2014 the Erasmus charter for Higher Education besides the first Erasmus project were obtained. As a consequence of the great success, the following year we got it again but for 24 months. In 2017 our target is to achieve it once again in order to ask for the Erasmus+ Vocational Education And Training Mobility Charter.\r\nThis projects contains two activities:\r\n1. Vocational training for one month at workplace in a European Country: the students are around 17 and 22 years old and study Vocational Education Training on commerce, administration, electromechanics, body work repairs, electronics and electricity. 40 students will be sent between 2018 and 2019. \r\n2.

The students must develop practical knowledge related to their field of study, acquire corporate culture and practical knowledge besides relate it to theory, develop autonomy, improve foreign language competences, enhance intercultural awareness, foster awareness of the European project, increase motivation to take part in future education or training after the mobility period abroad, improve learning performance, increase his/her sense of initiative, self-empowerment and self-esteem. This project will also enhance employability and improve career prospects. Moreover, this mobility project will strengthen cooperation between companies and schools and enhance social cohesion \r\nThe objectives staff mobility must achieve are the following: share teaching practice and improve the skills related to their professional profile, improve both their training  as well as the European education system knowledge, their language skills, their job opportunities, enhance intercultural awareness, promote excellence in teaching, develop innovative teaching methods, learn  how to fight against bullying and pass on what they have learned during the staff mobility period to students and teachers.\r\nThe programme will have an impact and some benefits on students, teachers and our school. The impact on our students is : motivation increase to take part in future education or training after the mobility period abroad, improvement of learning performance, reduction of school dropout, employability enhancement and improvement of career prospects, self-empowerment and self-esteem increase, personal and educational enrichment through the experience and promotion of the European values.\r\n The impact on our teachers is: enhancement of teaching practice, trigger changes in terms of modernization and internationalization in their educational organizations, motivation and satisfaction  increase in their daily work and broaden their horizons.
