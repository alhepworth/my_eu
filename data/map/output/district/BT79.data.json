As well as that the Irish group will involve the 18 young people that came to Ireland last year and their 4 leaders and music teachers.\r\nThis exchange of cultural and musical knowledge will enable young people to become responsible EUROPEAN CITIZENS who are aware of both the differences and similarities between these two cultures and how this diversity offers rich cultural awareness. Indeed, this exchange encourages: the youth to open their minds to other cultures and learning tolerance.

This will be facilitated through the exchange itself, all activities involved will help the young people and leaders to see how solidarity can be built between two cultures and how tolerance of others and their culture can open your mind to the richness of your own culture as well as other cultures.\r\n-promote young people's ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP - this will be facilitated through the exchange directly as these young people will see what can be learned and experienced through becoming active in various projects.\r\n-promote EUROPEAN COOPERATION in the youth field - the young people and especially the leaders will see clearly how important it is to influence young people at an early age on the positive aspects mentioned above and how European Cooperation at this level can open up so many opportunities to do this. You can preach to young people about the importance of tolerance and being active citizens but the lessons will be better learned and maintained if learned through experience and where better to learn than through practicing tolerance with a culturally different group to your own and through common interests!\r\n\r\nOur objectives are that we will enjoy a fulfilling and thoroughly enjoyable exchange which will both formally and informally teach our young people valuable lessons based around the importance of promoting and maintaining minority culture and music.\r\nThe activities implemented will be based around informal learning and learning through experience and the methods applied to achieve these aims will be similar - informal.

RTRIT is involved in various projects aimed to support learners with fewer opportunities, those of social, economic risk or lack of family support and to reduce number of early school leavers. For this project it opens opportunity to identify risk group and fewer opportunity youngsters and to invite them as participants. There are also students with special needs who have positive learning results and will be involved in international mobility. \r\nFollowing mobilities that have significant role in international development of RTRIT, are to be carried out in this project as described in the internationalization strategy:\r\n1) Long term mobilities of qualification training for last year students. CHASE network have mutually agreed upon exchange of the learners, quality measures of training programs, and developed training evaluation system for catering and hospitality fields according to ECVET that will be fully compatible with education systems working with ECVET. Mobility trainings realized within this project will be evaluated by the newly developed system.\r\n2) 3-5 week long mobilities for various training programs in different sectors and host organizations.  Mobility flows in Denmark are carried out as modules of education programs. Learning outcomes are assessed by ECVET tools and are recognized in RTRIT.  Also 4-week mobilities to Kaunas and 3-week to Tartu VEC will be done as modules and assessed by ECVET.  \r\n3) 2 week Mobilities addressing the needs of learners who are facing learning difficulties, losing learning motivation or are on the edge to be disclosed of voluntary leaving the education process.  In cooperation with partner-schools from Kaunas and Tartu mobility programs are specially designed to strengthen personality, develop social and communication skills, and raise learning motivation. These mobilities involve necessary accompanying persons that will support learners practically and mentally during the mobility.

On one hand, there is the ever increasing body of technical knowledge that students must command. On the other hand, there is a growing recognition that young engineers must possess a wider array of cross-disciplinary knowledge and skills that will allow them to function in real engineering teams and to produce real products and systems, meeting enterprise and societal needs. A knowledge of the tools, techniques and practices associated with the discipline of creativity and innovation is considered as a critical element for engineering education moving forward. \r\n\r\nTo support continuous innovation, future engineers must master more than the mathematical and scientific knowledge associated with their discipline, but also the ability to understand the role of innovation and creativity in order to fully comprehend the new product development process from idea generation through to commercialisation stage. Therefore, educational initiatives that invest in curriculum modernisation and the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes for promoting creativity and innovation are urgently required, particularly for engineering students who will be required to solve complex open-ended problems in today\u2019s rapidly changing environment.\r\n\r\nGiven this context, there is a need to develop new pedagogical and teacher training material focused on the integration of creativity and innovation curriculum into engineering VET. The Creative Engine project forms a strategic partnership between 5 EU partners with expertise in Engineering, Innovation and Creativity practices and Teacher Training. Collectively the partners aim to develop an openly accessible modular training course focused on the subject of creativity and innovation that will encourage future engineers to understand the value and relevance of these skills and competencies within their studies and careers. Creative Engine will also develop a teacher training programme to ensure VET trainers have the disciplinary knowledge, technical expertise and pedagogical techniques to effectively deliver engineering VET using \u201clearning-by-doing\u201d and \u201cflipped classroom\u201d approaches. \r\n\r\nTo enhance both student and trainer\u2019s creativity & innovation knowledge and practical skills, Creative Engine will utilise a blended leaning approach combining both formal and non-formal learning techniques. Project-based learning activities and game-based learning exercises will form an integral part of the modular training course (IO2) and the teacher training programme (IO3). These informal-learning techniques will be designed on modern engineering technologies such as Rapid Prototyping, 3D laser scanning and Automation, in order to provide dual-impact learning experiences which will simultaneously develop necessary technical skills in conjunction with creativity and innovation. This will ensure learners are equipped with the necessary knowledge required to boost their employability opportunities, entrepreneurial capability and ability to become leading engineers.", "http://www.swc.ac.uk", "SOUTH WEST COLLEGE", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-048069_coordinator"], [2017, "GARDENStoGROW: Urban Horticulture for Innovative and Inclusive Early Childhood Education", "SOUTH WEST COLLEGE", 313560.0, 4, 11, "Increasing quality and equity of ECEC services is a priority for all EU countries and can make a strong contribution, through enabling and empowering all children to realise their potential.

During this time more than 100 students and 10 teachers have been taking part in student mobilities and staff training abroad.\r\nPerho is one of the founding members of the CHASE network,  which has been operating for 27 years now. The network comprises 18 vocational schools in 15 European countries and has annually taken new members and countries to develop its activities and disseminate good practices. Foreign partners represent a broad range of languages and cultures and are reliable actors (many of them AEHT members). Gastronomic diversity is well taken into account when establishing the network. The colleges of the network represent traditional regional gastronomy. This gives students and staff a good opportunity to deepen their own gastronomy and customer service expertise. In 2016  Lapland Vocational College REDU joined the National Consortium. REDU has diverse experience in different international networks and is an expert in Ecvet.\r\n\r\nInternationality, digitality and entrepreneurship are the strategic highlights recorded in the operating plan. The Internationalization strategy is seen as a strengthening of the vision and contributes to the understanding and respect of multiculturalism and diversity. In accordance with the Internationalization Strategy, students' capacity for internationalization and mobility is promoted and the organization's level of expertise is increased. Our mission is to educate qualified and multi-skilled service professionals in a borderless and digitalized learning environment, which also promotes sustainable development, internationality and entrepreneurship. International mobilities are included in the student's Personal Competence Development Plans (HOKS). The iPerho e-learning campus, which is being developed during the project, supports and enables the students' individual learning paths to be realized. All students have a Personal Competence Development Plan (HOKS), which is updated during the studies. A module for international exchange serving students will be built for the campus, where the student receives information about the exchange and where the services are provided digitally, for example chat, blogs and guidance. The module works as a connecting contact platform where students can exchange experiences with each other and receive guidance. The iPerho e-learning campus will provide modules for core subjects, that students can also complete abroad, which speeds up their graduation. The on-the-job learning teacher is pedagogically present at the iPerho e-learning campus, where communication, guidance and evaluation will be documented.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the National Consortium is to produce a common process for the international Personal Competence Development Plan in accordance with the legislation on the reform of vocational education and training. The implementation and evaluation of HOKS will be ensured by Advance Planning Visits.\r\n\r\nThe international network's assessment competence (materials, guidance, evaluation and evaluation documentation) is guided in the directions required by Ecvet and the reform of vocational education,  especially taking into account the Learning Agreement for student's personal learning objectives and in particular ensuring their realization. The Consortium works as a mentor for the CHASE network partners, who do not have any experience and knowledge of Ecvet.\r\n\r\nPerho, Stao and REDU offer 5, 4 and 3 months ErasmusPro long term mobilities for 44 students (restaurant, bakery, tourism and business) in the CHASE network. A long on-the-job learning enables new working methods and raw materials, language and work culture to be learned. What is new in this project is that exchanges are also offered for adult learners / apprentices. The project's reciprocal 5 and 4-month student exchanges are started in all countries simultaneously in two different flows during the academic year. Both flows will be started in the host country by a four-week language and cultural preparation organized by the host institution, after which the host institution will organize a supervised on-the-job learning for students.

In total 96 students, both boys and girls will benefit from these mobilities. The pupils are often quite young and some have challenging social backgrounds. The financial support from Erasmus+ contributes to a good quality, well-structured training opportunity.Since 2004, we have been building a network of receiving hotels in Ireland, Scotland and Estonia and have worked hard to establish these contacts. These European countries were chosen for ease of access from France, The receiving partners are all high quality hotels and restaurants.The aim of our students is to pass their Vocational B TECH and to obtain the Europass certificate. After being prepared for the mobility, the students, travelling in pairs, are supervised and monitored by our local partners. The receiving hotels or resturaants keep in touch with the tutor in charge of the project. Teachers from the Lyc\u00e9e visit to assess the trainee.

They are enrolled in a complementary local initiative training - FCIL: Adaptability to Cooking and Catering Trade in Europe and Abroad (Adaptation aux M\u00e9tiers de l'H\u00f4tellerie en Europe et \u00e0 l'International).Our participants are mainly from the Paris area and they come from modest social backgrounds. They require financial and an organisational help. Our aims are to prepare our students to adapt to diverse cultural and vocational situations to enrich their lives. This project aims to further their vocational and social integration into the world of work and to familiarize them with applying a Lifelong Learning training. At our Lyc\u00e9e, our involvement in European programmes is part of the \"European and International Opening\" axis of our school project. This international dimension is likely to enhance our desirability in terms of recruitment and employability, contributing to the excellent reputation of our training and enhance the positive image of our school. Our project is supported by the strong C.H.A.S.E Network (Consortium of Hospitality and Accommodation Schools Schools of Europe) which is now of 24 years standing and has 14 partner catering schools or institutions located in 13 European countries: Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Finland , Ireland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, and Turkey. It is thanks to this network that the mobility projects can be realised; the wide range of European destinations has a strong attraction for students wanting to participate. In order to coordinate our activities, improve communication and to make long-lasting partnerships, a annual meeting is organized where we decide on a joint focus for the project e,g, this year we chose: Awareness of Health and Nutrition in the Cookery and Catering sector in Europe, The mobilities last for five months. During the first 4 weeks there is a period of cultural and linguistic training to prepare the students for their internships in hotels or restaurants. During the four months internship students are accommodated in the hotel or in nearby hostels or apartments. Students have a nominated supervisor in the hotel or restaurant placements and are also monitored by a tutor from the receiving partner and from the Lyc\u00e9e, the sending organisation.

Students from grades 10 and 11 study kitchen and service techniques, while those of 11 and 12 grades are specialized in catering and tourism.  \r\nSteps of the programme: discussing and agreeing upon the conditions and circumstances (most recent in Tenerife), recruiting beneficiaries on the basis of their applications, preparation at sending school, travelling, preparation at the receiving school, work placement, travelling back home, evaluation and dissemination. The tutorial and monitoring process runs parallel with the programme, therefore the opportunity is given to intervene whenever required.\r\nThe aim of the preparation  period at the sending school is to provide the beneficiaries with the chance to improve their language and professional skills, needed during the work placement. The students study the essence and rules of the programme and the laws applicable to the employees  in the receiving country. Furthermore a programme is provided which helps students to adapt themselves to the local surroundings. Before their journey, they take part in a \u2018self knowledge\u2019 and personality improvement training.\r\nThe placement abroad consists of 2 periods: first the students take part in a 4-week cultural and language course at the receiving school. This course is followed by a 4-month work placement. The students write a diary, in which they describe their own experience. The evaluation of the managers at the work placement is included. The beneficiaries also receive an evaluation sheet in which they evaluate the programme on the basis of given guidelines. \r\nThe skills and knowledge acquired during the programme are acknowledged on the one hand by certificates, diplomas and reference letters issued by the receiving partner  and the work placement and on the other hand, by accepting placement abroad as professional practice on the part of the sending partner.\r\nThe expected results of the programme are to enable students to make decisions on their own, to make soups alone, to know the preparation methods of seafood, specialties of the receiving country, to know how to set the table on their own, how to take orders, apply different serving methods, how to deal with bills. They are able to use technical terminology and they are open towards other cultures.\r\nIn the short run, the result of the project is that students achieve better scores at their exams, in the long run, they find jobs on the labour market more easily, also, their employer abroad may offer them a full-time job.", "http://www.swc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HU01-KA102-035497_15"], [2016, "Stages Hotel - Restaurant - Keuken Stella Maris 2016", "SOUTH WEST COLLEGE", 140916.0, 5, 5, "WORKPLACEMENT STUDENTS VET\r\nWorkplacement in 2017 for students of the third degree of the departments Restaurant-Kitchen vocational secondary education, the 7the specialisation years Domestic Caterer and Restaurantmanagement-Beverages, Hotel Technical secondary education and the Se-n-Se Hotelmanagement in Iceland, United Kingdom, Italy and Malta.

This project provides College Level 3 apprentices with a 3 week European work-placement that will enhance and improve their practical skills and knowledge in the vocational areas of Motor Vehicle and Mechanic, Chefs and Beauty Therapy.  It will also build there self as-teem and confidence as the target group are apprentices who are hard to reach and disadvantaged.The Motor Mechanic apprentices will be under taking a work placement in high quality garages in France.   On top of their placement within the UK as a requirement of their core programme, these European placements will further give learners the opportunity to develop a range of skills and techniques, personal skills and attributes essential for successful performance in working life.   Their personal development will be further enhanced by this European perspective to allow contrasts, comparisons and incremental learning to take place. (TRAINING PLANS ARE ATATCHED)The apprentices that will be participating in this project come from very rural country areas where job opportunities are very limited and the competition for jobs that are advertised is very intense.  The aim of this project proposal in the chosen vocation areas through apprentice mobilities is to enable participants gain new skills and knowledge that make them more competitive in seeking and gaining employment in the labour market.  The placement is tailored to the apprentices NVQ course.  The project will find out what the young person wants to get out of the placement, which skills they want to develop, what barriers they face and what their career aspirations are.  The majority of apprentices participating in this project come from areas of high levels social deprivation where opportunities are very limited.  From the College experience these apprentices are hard to reach out to and in many cases have low self-motivation, low self-esteem and lack a lot of confidence in their own abilities in being able to access new opportunities.  The aim of this project is to provide not only an opportunity for apprentices to gain new skills but also to raise their aspirations and have a European work-placement and experience that will be life changing.  This project aims to emphasise to apprentices the tremendous opportunity and scope the European union offers in terms of labour market and job opportunities and being able to have the confidence to work in different countries as a result of new language.  The project aims to provide a mobility experience for groups of apprentices who due to financial factors do not get the chance for learning through exchange.  In addition to the vocational training and skills development that apprentices will acquire, they will also gain new and more updated vocational and customer service skills, better communication skills, more improved teamwork and problem solving abilities and genuine practical life experience will result from mobility.  With regard to skills gaps apprentices need to be more flexible in their attitude, require enhanced motivation and the wider work based learning experiences that a European placement provides.For apprentices from relatively disadvantaged backgrounds and prone to risk of leaving College early and whose basic skills require nurturing, project involvement will significantly contribute to improving attainment, enhancing employability, broadening horizons and creating an energy and enthusiasm for learning.  This project will develop partnerships between education and employment that significantly contribute to the development of key competences and transversal skills relevant to labour market requirements.  Similarly it will enhance and reiterate the award winning international dimension of the College, (winner of the 2012 British Council Further Education International Collaboration Award) all of which mirror the specific objectives of the Erasmus+ programme.  For example it reflects fully the aims of mobility by supporting apprentices in the acquisition of competences, (knowledge, skills and attitudes), \u2022with a view to improving personal development and employability throughout Europe.  It will also raise the apprentice\u2019s awareness and understanding of other cultures, facilitating the acquisition of international contacts so important in a global world.  Our organisation will grow by integrating practices across our campuses and throughout Europe.  It will give rise to new thoughts practices and activities that compliment organisational objectives such as professional development, standing in the community, not to mention the enhanced learning opportunities provided by an increasingly dynamic staff with access to more and more resources, thoughts and ideas.

The participants were for young workers who had completed their predominantly City and Guild qualifications and their equivalents from the St\u00e4dtische Berufsschule M\u00fcnchen. The students from both countries spent 6 weeks in the host college and 4.5 months in local industry. This program was funded by the Young workers Program.\r\n  \r\nUp to today there is taking place an annual meeting with all our partners \u2013 every year in another place to have the possibility to visit the placements and learn to know the proceedings of the schools where we send our students to.

These actions support the school\u2019s vision and strengthens and promotes sustainable development such as understanding and respecting multiculturalism and diversity. Internationality is a natural part of everyday school activities. Students' capacity for internationalization and international mobility is supported, which also promotes the rise of organization's level of know-how. Work placements abroad enable different kinds of learning environments and individual learning pathways for students. Incoming international students bring in know-how and increase the internationalization in the school. Organization\u2019s strategy for internationalization includes finding new partnerships and increasing possibilities for international mobility to meet the students\u2019 increasing interest and need for international experience. The development discussions of the staff have shown that teachers have gaps in international expertise, as well as the need for language skills and IT skills development. Also ECVET knowledge is insufficient, consequently the teachers familiar with the principles of ECVET before the exchange period. Teachers are trained to use electronic means like Skype in accordance with the development plan for the staff, which enables for example vocational skills demonstration assessment in real-time for students abroad. The curriculum team's task is to develop the international dimension of the curriculum and make reforms according to Ecvet.The project is coordinated by Helsinki Culinary School Perho while Helsinki Vocational College and Lapland Tourism College are acting as domestic partners. The project is carried out with the International CHASE Network, which consists of 22 hospitality and catering colleges around Europe. Most of the colleges act both as a sending and a receiving partner. The Network has been operating for 25 years and represents a wide range of different language and cultural areas. From the gastronomic point of view, the colleges represent traditional European regional gastronomy. Gaining know-how and skills from the traditional European gastronomy strengthens the participants\u2019 possibilities for employment and success in labor market.The participants of the project are teachers and primary and upper secondary based students, who study a vocational qualification. The two-year project provides 40 students with the possibility of 4-5 months exchange and 14 teachers with 12 days, and 2 teachers with 5 weeks training abroad. The student exchange consists of a 4 -week language and cultural training in the host college and of on-the-job learning. During the exchange period the students learn skills needed in the internationalizing working life in addition to the professional skills. International work skills include different languages, networking and acting in a multicultural environment as well as different working cultures and customs. The skills and learning outcomes acquired abroad are validated and recognized as part of the qualification. The project makes use of Europass Certificate Supplement, Europass CV and Europass Mobility Document.The teacher training abroad strengthens professional skills and international competences. Teacher exchanges aim to take place in the same restaurants, where the students are placed. This will strengthen the assessment know-how in the work placements towards the ECVET-principles. The assessment documents tested in the previous project will be developed further. The teacher exchange takes place, when the students start their on-the-job learning. Teachers familiarize the staff in the work placement with the vocational skills demonstrations and the assessment targets such as the knowledge, the skills and the  competence of the student.

The planned duration of the mobilities is 19 to 20 days.\r\n\r\nTeachers visit the educational institutions of our partners in order to gain insights into their organizational structures, their quality management, their teaching styles and methods, and  their internationalization strategies. As a result, both the individual teachers and the Knobelsdorff School receive important new impulses for the further development of the school program and curricula. The duration of the mobilities shall be 2 to 12 days.\r\n\r\nThis creates an awareness of the social significance of international partnerships for education and employment.\r\nInternational exchange is not an end in itself, but results in culturally inspired and qualitatively enhanced learning outcomes. The aim of the Knobelsdorff School is to improve the participants' ability to participate in democratic life in Europe, to make our education system more efficient and to facilitate the entry of young people into the European labor market. The central goal of this project is the communication of important key and specialist skills, improvements in the foreign language sector as well as the familiarness towards people from other cultures.", "http://www.swc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004784_3"], [2015, "Health Is Your Wealth.", "SOUTH WEST COLLEGE", 106787.0, 3, 9, "The aim of this project proposal is for 48 Health and Social Care, Child Care, Chef and Beauty Therapy apprentices in two flows to undertake a mobility placement with the College\u2019s direct employer based partners in Iceland and in Sweden. This project provides College Level 3 apprentices with a 3 week European work-placement that will enhance and improve their practical skills and knowledge in the vocational areas of Health and Social Care, Child Care, Chefs and Beauty Therapy. It will also build their self-esteem and confidence as the target group are apprentices who are hard to reach and disadvantaged.\r\nThe Health and Social Care and Childcare apprentices will undertake a mobility in two flows to employer-based partners in Sweden. On top of their placement within the UK as a requirement of their core programme, these European placements will further give learners the opportunity to develop a range of skills and techniques, personal skills and attributes essential for successful performance in working life. Their personal development will be further enhanced by this European perspective to allow contrasts, comparisons and incremental learning to take place.\r\nThe apprentices that will be participating in this project come from very rural country areas where job opportunities are very limited and the competition for jobs that are advertised is very intense. The aim of this project proposal in the chosen vocation areas through apprentice mobilities is to enable participants to gain new skills and knowledge that make them more competitive in seeking and gaining employment in the labour market. The placement is tailored to the apprentices NVQ course and the project will find out what the young person wants to get out of the placement, which skills they want to develop, what barriers they face and what their career aspirations are. The majority of apprentices participating in this project come from areas of high social deprivation where opportunities are very limited. From the College's experience these apprentices are hard to reach out to and in many cases have low self-motivation, low self-esteem and lack a lot of confidence in their own abilities in being able to access new opportunities. The aim of this project is to provide not only an opportunity for apprentices to gain new skills but also to raise their aspirations and have a European work-placement and experience that will be life changing. This project aims to emphasise the tremendous opportunity and scope the European union offers in terms of labour market and job opportunities and being able to have the confidence to work in different countries as a result of a new language. The project aims to provide a mobility experience for groups of apprentices who, due to financial factors, do not get the chance for learning through exchange.  In addition to the vocational training and skills development that apprentices will acquire, they will also gain new and more updated vocational and customer service skills, better communication skills, more improved teamwork and problem solving abilities and genuine practical life experience resulting from mobility. With regard to skills gaps apprentices need to be more flexible in their attitude, require enhanced motivation and the wider work based learning experiences that a European placement provides.\r\nFor apprentices from relatively disadvantaged backgrounds, prone to risk of leaving College early and whose basic skills require nurturing, project involvement will significantly contribute to improving attainment, enhancing employability, broadening horizons and creating an energy and enthusiasm for learning. This project will develop partnerships between education and employment that significantly contribute to the development of key competences and transversal skills relevant to labour market requirements. Similarly it will enhance and reiterate the award winning international dimension of the College (winner of the 2012 British Council Further Education International Collaboration Award), which mirrors the specific objectives of the Erasmus+ programme. For example, it fully reflects the aims of mobility by supporting apprentices in the acquisition of competences (knowledge, skills and attitudes), with a view to improving personal development and employability throughout Europe. It will also raise the apprentice\u2019s awareness and understanding of other cultures, facilitating the acquisition of international contacts which is so important in a global world.  Our organisation will grow by integrating practices across our campuses and throughout Europe.

This action supports the school\u2019s vision and strengthens and promotes sustainable development such as understanding and respecting multiculturalism and diversity. Internationality is a natural part of everyday school activities. Students' capacity for internationalization and international mobility is supported, which also promotes the rise of organization's level of know-how. Work placements abroad enable different kinds of learning environments and individual learning pathways for students. Incoming international students bring in know-how and increase the internationalization in the school. Organization\u2019s strategy for internationalization includes finding new partnerships and increasing possibilities for international mobility to meet the students\u2019 increasing interest and need for international experience. The curriculum team's task is to develop the international dimension of the curriculum and make reforms according to Ecvet, for example taking the learning points into account. \r\n\r\nThe project is coordinated by Helsinki Culinary School Perho while Helsinki Vocational College is acting as a domestic partner. The project is carried out with the International CHASE Network, which consists of 18 hospitality and catering colleges around Europe. Most of the colleges act both as a sending and a receiving partner. The Network has been operating for over 20 years and represents a wide range of different language and cultural areas. From the gastronomic point of view, the colleges represent traditional European regional gastronomy. Gaining know-how and skills from the traditional European gastronomy strengthens the participants\u2019 possibilities for employment and success in labor market.\r\n\r\nThe participants of the project are primary and upper secondary based students, who study the Vocational Qualification in Hotel, Restaurant and Catering Services. The two-year project provides 40 students with the possibility of 4 and 5 months' exchange within the CHASE network colleges. \r\n\r\nThe exchange consists of a 4 -week language and cultural training in the host college and of a work placement. During the exchange period the students learn skills needed in the internationalizing working life in addition to the professional skills. International work skills include different languages, networking and acting in a multicultural environment as well as different working cultures and customs. During the language and cultural training the participants study languages, some of which are rare or less-used, such as Hungarian, Turkish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Flemish and Latvian.\r\n\r\nThe skills and learning outcomes acquired abroad are validated and recognized as part of the qualification.

New generations need to be not overwhelmed by a feeling of impotence and they should become innovative agents of change and social transformation. In addition to this, the context of the Agenda for new skills and jobs, the recent forecast of future skills\u2019 need anticipate an increase in jobs requiring high-or medium- level qualifications. However, such qualifications need to be accompanied by the key competences that equip young people to work in intercultural, multilingual and rapidly changing circumstances. Social Innovator Students (SIS) Project creates a partnership with four partners  from TR, EL, PT and UK focusing on the sense of initiative and entrepreneurship to create opportunities and products to be the bridge the gap between the needs of the world of work & the skills provided by the school.  The present project intends to address this specific need, promoting the Education for Global Citizenship (EGC)  and Entreprenual Skills by enhancing interactive teaching in secondary schools in Europe through use of real life like scenerios, social responsibility projects, contests which include and deepen Sustainable Education and Development Education. Global Citizenship Education (EGC)and Entrepreneurships Education (EE) point out to the empowering of the individual, not only to the transmission of notions. SIS project promotes and reinforces the idea of making active and creative contributions to society on a local and national as well as international level through supporting each theme with the tasks as the successors of workshops such as public campaigns, social responsibility projects  to promote empowerment, participation and the active citizenship of young people. In addition to this, it makes the pupils actively involved in socio-economic life around them and exchange this experience with other members in a network of active citizens through job shadowing, career days and success stories. SIS Project aspires to develop workshops, tasks and contest to develop the key competences for enhancing the creativity, competitiveness, employability, entrepreneurial and leadership spirit of pupils between 13- 18. It helps to reinforce young people\u2019s motivation, stimulate and nurture their creativity and entrepreneurship through planning the innovative projects, competitions and SIS Career in TR. SIS project-based learning promotes entrepreneurial skills through 4 workshops based on the theme of entrepreneurship through deepening  Global Citizenship Education (EGC) and Entrepreneurships Education (EE) to give students the attitudes, knowledge and skills to act in a entrepreneurial way. The workshops, scenarios, tasks and projects based on 4 entrepreneurship themes: LEADERSHIP, ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP, TEAM WORK & ORGANIZATION and CREATIVITY & INNOVATION developing basic and transversal skills using innovative methods.  During the project each theme will be linked with the different school subjects to see the connection of the education with the real life and they will be reinforced with the tasks according to the given scenarios. The project will be sustained with the SIS councils in partner countries to empower the pupils to take decisions and action to improve their schools and local community through engaging the social responsibility projects. The partners will also create the SIS community including the actors of the education to reach more people to raise their awareness about the real life problems and support the collaboration with different stakeholders via e-newsletters and calls for the events. So the teachers and students will act as the social innovators through preparing the success stories, planning the job shadowing, public campaigns. In September 2017 the project Entrepreneurship Youth Camp will be organized in Portugal. Apart from this, the students innovative and initiative projects will be voted online and the local winners will be chosen to share their projects as the good practices in SIS Career Day in TR as leaders for future from partner countries.

The experience acquired and the competences improved helped in preparing and starting two modular training programs (finisher and bricklayer) from September 2016. The Centre also started implementing apprenticeship as one of the training forms, and developed the documents that regulate sending and incoming mobilities of VET students and trainers. The establishment of practical training centre in VBTC allows the upgrading of qualification of different target groups, including VET trainers, construction workers, higher education students, secondary school students, unemployed people. Recently the Centre has signed Partnership Agreements with VET institutions from Finland and Estonia. \r\nA working group set at Vilnius Builders Training Centre and responsible for the strategic planning, for the development and implementation of new training programmes and for the international cooperation strategy, analysed and detected which  competences can be acquired by teachers, trainers, students and managing staff in the country and which specific knowledge and practice should be looked for abroad.   In order to improve VET quality, efficiency  and transnational cooperation, the Centre developed a project idea aiming at detecting new training and learning possibilities for the different target groups in construction sector, developing more flexible training conditions and ensuring better chances within the labour market. \r\nThe project aims at transferring the good European practice in applying active and innovative teaching and learning methods that help the students acquire the required competences, develop their feelings, understanding, reasoning and abilities, VET skills, foster their motivation for active and independent learning and working. It is foreseen to benefit from the experience of international partners, namely, from flexible modular training system, ECVET system, apprenticeship training.

Our idea is that they will make use of this experience and possibility in their future and current professions in school, elderly care or child care.\r\n\r\nThis means that in our project YET both young children from preschools, old people from rest homes and students and staff from Victum Gymnasium and South West College (SWC) will be involved.\r\n\r\nObjective 3: As The Europe 2020 strategy highlights the completion of upper secondary education as the minimum\r\n\r\nlevel of educational attainment for young people in today's society, an objective of our project YET is to increase the number of students completing their education at our school to over 90%. This means that they also more successfully can integrate into the labour market after leaving our school.\r\n\r\nThe participants will be earning the skills and knowledge of how to work with young and old people together in their future and current professions in school, elderly care and child care. This will inspire the students to create these meeting places between young and old at their future working sites. The staff will be more professional and competent in their teaching, guiding their students to work in an intergenerational way. This project will also help all the participants to make use of the opportunities EU gives them in terms of different projects in the future. They will improve their knowledge and skills in the English language and this will also help them to see the possibilities of seeking future jobs in the EU and to increase their inter-European mobility.", "http://www.swc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SE01-KA102-000137_1"], [2016, "Young and Elderly in a European Perspective", "SOUTH WEST COLLEGE", 43006.0, 3, 3, "In our project YEEP, Young and Elderly in a European Perspective, Victum Gymnasium will send 24 students and 8 teachers from The Health Care Programme and The Child Care Programme to South West College in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, and COOS MARCHE ONLUS in Ancona, Italy.

The public note announcement will be made on the school websites and on the hall notice boards. Specifically, it will be made public thanks to the tutors, and with informative meetings with the students interested in the mobilities. The selection will be carried out following the criteria established on this form, and with the help of the foreign language departments and the career advisors of the school. Communication with the students abroad and the mentors in the hosting organizations will be made through eTwinning. OUTCOMES AND IMPACT:As regards students:- Students highly motivated to improve their linguistic and professional competences.- Improved quality and educational offer of the schools, what will make them more competitive- Recognition of the competences and skills acquired: Europass- Students more motivated to take part in the future formal/non formal education after the mobility period abroad- Enhanced employability and improved career prospects- Enhanced intercultural awareness- More active participation in society- Better awareness of European projects- Increased sense of initiative and entrepeneurshipAs regards teachers and organizations:- More international and opened institutions- Increased support and promotion of mobility activities for learners- Enhanced teaching practice thanks to the feedback provided by the students taking part in the mobilities - Increased teacher motivation and satisfaction in their daily work- Broader understanding of practices and systems of education and training in other countries- Improved foreign language competences for the teachers involved- Synergies with other European projects/ educational projects of our schoolsLONG-TERM BENEFITS:We expect this project to be sustainable in the long run. To do so we will invite the students involved in the mobilities to share their experiences with the rest of students at school taking advantage of the celebrations we hold on 9th May, Europe Day. In the same way, the students' new experience will remain visible for the public on the websites of the school with interviews or video clips that may encourage other youngsters. The schools will be have a more modern, committed and professional environment, able to integrate new methods and good practice into their daily activities. Thus, we will have a more international impact and will be ready to create synergies with organizations active in different social, educational and employment fields. In the long term the enterprises surrounding us will be more competent and international employing young workers with Erasmus+ experience.

We have a Bilingual Program running in Secondary Education and we want to expand this program to some Vocational Technical fields. Some of the courses we offer cannot be done elsewhere in our region, such as those within the audiovisual sector.  We have been developing different European programs since 2000. We have coordinated several Comenius, Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ projects. We are very enthusiastic of Erasmus+ and all the possibilities it offers the whole school community.

We have a \u201cMobility Committee\u201d formed by the Erasmus coordinators of different projects, the Headteacher and the School Bursar.\r\nObjectives:\r\n- To offer the students in the Vocational Training Course at intermediate level the opportunity to do their traineeship in the UK and Ireland. Thus, they will enhance their professional competences by getting to know different working methods better, they will also improve their linguistic competences in the foreign language and will also develop their social and life skills having to live on their own in a different country.\r\n- To offer the teachers the opportunity to know different working methodologies in a foreign school and improve their linguistic competence in English. To get to know the labour market of a foreign country better in order to be able to create synergies and to improve their social skills.\r\nNumber of participants and their profile:\r\nThere will be four students to do their internships in UK or Ireland. Their social profile is medium/low although they are highly motivated by their teachers, so that, their personal situation won\u2019t stop them from developing both personally and professionally. \r\nFour teachers will do a job shadowing. The teachers will be selected according to the following criteria: permanent teachers at school, Chiefs of studies, B2 level of English and  \u201cMobility Committee\u201d recommendation.\r\nActivities:\r\n- Advertisement of Erasmus+ grantships. Students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 selection according to the aforementioned criteria. \r\n- Linguistic and cultural online course \r\n- Management of transportation, accommodation, host institution for internship and insurance.\r\n- Planning of the working program within the host institution/Enterprise and schedule of the job shadowing.\r\n- Contract filling according to our National Agency model.\r\n- Traineeship in the first or third term of the school year. For teachers the chief of studies will be asked as to know the best dates for their job shadowing.\r\n - Traineeship monitoring by communication with their tutors and mentors.\r\n- Management of all the documentation after the mobility. Handing out the Europass Mobility documents and filling out our student/teacher satisfaction feedback form. \r\nMethodology:\r\n- Transparent and objective management. \r\n- Standardized documents created by the \u201cMobility Committee\u201d, and will be advertised on the different school media.\r\n- A specific website for Erasmus+ is being designed currently within the school website, so that we can offer the most updated information, as well as document repository.\r\n- The mobilities monitoring will take place weekly via email with students\u2019 mentor, via Skype at the beginning and in the middle of the internship and at any time via Whatsapp. \r\nResults description:\r\n- Professional competence enhancement due to the better knowing of a different country working world.\r\n- Linguistic competence improvement. \r\n- Social and life skills development in a foreign country.\r\n- The teachers will improve the same competences apart from learning new teaching and professional methodologies. \r\n- New synergies will be created with the host institution staff.\r\nLong term impact:\r\n- Students with better entrepreneurial expectations. \r\n- Linguistic competence and intercultural awareness improvement. \r\n- Motivation to follow further studies.\r\n- Acquisition of a new perspective within their professional field.\r\n- CV enrichment.\r\n- To become more mature in the personal aspects due to the fact that they have to\r\nlive on their own in a foreign country. \r\n- Regarding teachers, we can add to all the previously described the fact that they will be able to know how an equivalent institution handles teaching in the same fields. The linguistic competence is essential for teachers if we want to be ready to teach our subjects in English as Europe 2020 demands.  \r\n- The job shadowing will help us be in touch with the Irish/British business network and will allow us to obtain interinstitutional agreements. \r\n- The Project will promote our economy competitiveness thanks to the better qualification of our students.", "http://www.swc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-037128_3"]], "extra": 14}}, "7BL": {"esif": {"data": [[1388534400000, 1609459200000, "ASPIRE", "FERMANAGH & OMAGH DISTRICT COUNCIL (FODC)", null, "ESF", 2070520.0, 3185416.0, "esf_ni_54"], [1388534400000, 1609459200000, "ASPIRE", "FERMANAGH AND OMAGH DISTRICT COUNCIL", null, "ESF", 1106269.0, 2765673.0, "esf_ni_96"]]}}, "7DH": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Accueil Relation COMmerce Vente de l'Acad\u00e9mie de Lyon", "Silverbirch Hotel & Business Centre", 368068.0, 11, 33, "The consortium presented here has for objective to contribute to the updating and upgrading of the professional skills of all the participants.

The piloting committee is in charge of developing the project, of insuring the follow-up, the management and the evaluation of the project. The latter also has to check the financial balance and controls that the various actors meet their commitments. The sending organizations will respect the terms of the mobility program of the consortium. They are in charge of the evaluation of the participants. All French and European partners have an experience in placements since most of them have already used Mobility programs. So, each one knows one\u2019s mission and it will done seriouslyThe young people will be more efficient on the job market, they will enrich their professional, cultural and linguistic skills, they will see Europe differently, they will improve their skills in ICT, they will be more autonomous. The partners will develop a network of training organizations, a partnership \u201ccompany-school\u201d at the European level, exchange innovative practices and give a new image to vocational schools. The staff will improve their professional skills, enrich their educational practices, exchange skills and knowledge and discover other education systems. Expected impact: improvement of the professional, practical and theoretical skills of the teachers. For the learners, it will be an undeniable professional added value which will be transformed into assets on the job market and it will offer career developments to the staffs involved in the project. Expected impact: renewal and sustainability of the project in 2018-2020.
