They mainly comprise a mosaic of two Annex 1 Habitats Directive woodland habitats: ‘Old sessile oak woods with Ilex and Blechnum in the British Isles’ and ‘Tilio-Acerion forests of slopes, screes and ravines’. However, the conservation status of these two habitats is ‘unfavourable-bad and declining’ and ‘unfavourable-bad’ at the Atlantic biogeographic level. The primary cause is invasion by non-native plant species, especially the shrub Rhododendron ponticum, which alters light and soil conditions, outcompetes native flora and suppresses regeneration. Among the other threats are over- or under-grazing, a lack of management, and atmospheric nitrogen pollution. The UK holds around 95% of the old sessile woods and 70% of the Tilio-Acerion forest habitats, and therefore has a particular responsibility to return these habitats to a ‘favourable’ conservation status."

In the UK, all the Habitat Directive Annex I sand dune habitats are in ‘Unfavourable’ conservation status due to such stabilisation, which leads to the loss or decline of those species which depend upon bare sand and early successional sand dune stages. Wales accounts for 11 % (8 101 ha) of the total UK sand dune resource, including rare and threatened dune habitats. The re-introduction of dynamic processes is therefore vital for the conservation of the full range of sand dune habitats."

In this largely treeless landscape, most birds are ground-nesting and therefore exposed to the threat of predation by introduced mammals. The impacts of the introduced non-native stoat on Orkney’s native wildlife are therefore predicted to be severe, and could lead to dramatic declines in populations of the species listed in the Birds Directive on the Orkney Islands."

It is thought that the UK’s dune area has been reduced to 30 % of that present in 1900, and in England the losses are closer to 50 %. Natural England manages nine National Nature Reserves (covering 954 ha) that have sand dune habitats of European importance. The project takes place across eight Natura 2000 network sites (SACs), which contain a total of 3 412 ha of all seven Habitats Directive Annex 1 sand dune habitat types present in England. The latest UK Article 17 report on the implementation of the Directive states that these habitats are in an overall ‘unfavourable-bad’ conservation status and that this has reached a critical point.

Animals are drawn to agricultural areas for food, but this leads to consequences for both animals and farmers. Chemical poisons are often used to control rodent populations in areas where they destroy crops, eat livestock feed and can transmit disease. However, studies have shown that anticoagulant rodenticides contribute to the deaths of a variety of mammal and bird species. The poison accumulates in the food chain, so for animals that prey on or scavenge rodents this repeated exposure may be fatal. Meanwhile, farmers continue to lose billions of euros each year as a result of damage to crops caused by animals.

The floodplain consists of humid, species-rich grassland, with ditches and some standing water usually persisting through the spring months. The traditional farming pattern of the valley reflects the propensity for winter flooding. In 1982, the Avon Valley constituted one of the top eight lowland wet grassland sites in England for breeding waders. It has historically supported nationally important populations of breeding northern lapwing (<i>Vanellus vanellus</i>), redshank (<i>Tringa totanus</i>) and common snipe (<i>Gallinago gallinago</i>). However, numbers of breeding waders in the Avon Valley have decreased dramatically, with declines of 64% in lapwing, 75% in redshank and 97% in snipe recorded from 1982 to 2002. This is mainly due to the agricultural improvement of wet grassland habitats involving drainage, fertilisation of grass swards, increased livestock densities, and high rates of nest predation. Monitoring of lapwing breeding success over recent years has shown that it is currently too low for the maintenance of a stable breeding population."

These sources can be vegetable based (rape oil) or animal based (animal fat). In each case crude glycerine is produced as a by-product of the production processes.

It has over 1500 known end uses in cosmetics, toiletries, personal care, drugs and food product. However, the processing necessary to achieve pure glycerine is very energy and water intensive. On top of consuming high amounts of energy for the refining process and transportation and water, the process also requires the bleaching and cleaning of processing equipment using aggressive chemicals such as phosphoric acid and caustic soda. The waste produced during the procedure is either discharged into surface water or dumped in old salt mines. In addition, the demand for pure glycerine is low compared to the amount of crude glycerine available and this means it has now become a low-value by-product in danger of becoming a waste product.

40,4758,Ellen MacArthur Foundation,381780.00,190889.00,"The economy has typically had one fundamental characteristic: a linear model of resource consumption that follows a ‘take-make-dispose’ approach. Companies harvest and extract materials, use them to manufacture a product, and sell the product to a consumer, who then discards it when it no longer serves its purpose. A linear system not only demonstrates a very inefficient use of natural resources, but disposal of a product in landfill means that all its residual energy is lost. The incineration or recycling of discarded products recoups a small share of this energy, whereas re-use saves significantly more energy. The use of energy resources in a linear production model is typically most intensive in the upstream parts of the supply chain - i.e. the steps involved in extracting materials from the earth and converting them into a commercially usable form. In contrast, a circular economy is an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design. It replaces the ‘end-of-life’ concept with restoration, a shift towards the use of renewable energy, and it aims to eliminate waste through the superior design of materials, products, systems, and business models."

The first is to provide EU citizens with the necessary services, infrastructure, products and knowledge. The second is to engage EU citizens to make changes to their lifestyles that will reduce consumption, and to encourage them to sort waste for reuse and recycling. To achieve these goals, public participation is key to both implementing and driving forward the principles of the waste hierarchy. However, public participation varies greatly on a geographical basis, with huge variations in recycling levels across Europe and large variations within countries.

At a global level, the methane in landfill gas contributes to climate change. The UK, and the European Union generally, has a huge legacy of closed landfill sites, many of which are derelict or under-used. They represent a significant liability because of their potential to be sources of migrating toxic contaminants and landfill gas. There are approximately 20 000 closed landfill sites in the UK. A recent trial conducted by the Environment Agency indicated accessible whole-site landfill methane volumes of around 100-150 m3/hr.

A single business or a geographical area is subject to a range of environmental laws each requiring different datasets for permitting, compliance, monitoring, incidents and enforcement. A challenge facing regulators such as the EA is that the data that they gather to support the implementation of specific environmental laws do not easily or usefully align with the businesses they regulate or the geographical areas where improvements to the environment are needed. Instead regulators are limited to looking at data in isolated, disconnected datasets which prevents them from seeing clearly the environmental performance of a whole company or the environmental impacts on a region. Integrated data and information can provide regulators with the evidence to best target resources to protect the environment and people by offering a clear view of those businesses that are performing well and those that are performing badly.

The UK is densely populated and highly developed, so natural habitats have suffered as a consequence, but at the same time it has relatively effective laws and regulations relating to planning and biodiversity and enjoys a degree of public support for conservation efforts. Landscape-scale conservation effectively extends the existing network of protected areas and aims to enhance its overall connectivity.

One of the most important regulatory features is that all businesses must have written information for the waste they handle. Traditionally this means using waste transfer notes (WTN). These describe the type and quantity of waste and how it is packaged – and signed by both the sender and receiver of the waste. Written information, like WTNs, must accompany any transfer of waste between different parties and be kept for scrutiny for at least two years. This regulatory paper-based system currently produces more than 23 million WTNs/year in the UK, leading to archive paper storage for some 150 million paper WTNs.

It also puts great pressure on the environment through inadequate disposal and the additional impact of extracting and processing new materials, and the manufacturing and distribution of new goods. Although data on waste across the EU is inconsistent, a wide range of different waste streams are still increasing in volume, such as household waste and packaging waste. Waste disposal methods are not coping with these increased loads, and, most significantly, waste generation is still linked to economic activity. So waste generation grows as the economy grows.
The Landfill Directive sets targets for reducing the amount of biodegradable waste to landfill, and the recently revised Waste Framework Directive (WFD) sets new targets for recycling construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste (70% by 2020) and household waste (50% by 2020). The Sixth Community Environment Action Plan calls for measures aimed at ensuring the source separation, collection and recycling of priority waste streams. Moreover, the WFD lays out a five-step waste hierarchy with waste prevention as the preferred option.

- They are designed to produce coated products in large quantities as required for commercial viability only;
- The continuous nature of the process causes waste when product recipes are changed and makes such changes more difficult;
- Plants are stationary and have a significant environmental footprint;  
- Plants also require large storage areas to maintain operational levels of feedstock;
- Wastage problems occur because of operational difficulties in matching the various elements of the process;
- Systems have high fuel consumptions, wasting both electricity and gas/oil through an inability to modulate burners and dryers and;
- Plants have high maintenance costs.

Batch-heater coating plants were historically designed for particular applications for a small sector of the British market. However, progressive development of production features, involving additional mechanical components and updated process control systems, means that these plants now offer a high degree of control for the production of coated roadstone. The advantages of batch heaters are that they are:

- able to produce the product in variable quantities from 0.5 to 5.0 tonnes, on a batch-
  by-batch basis;
- able to offer a range of 150 product mixes;
- suitable for urban locations;
- require a smaller storage area; and
- leave a smaller environmental footprint. 

However, like large asphalt plants, batch-heater coating plants use large motors to operate conveyors, fans and burners to heat the aggregate to the required temperature.

The Advanced Filtration Management (AFM) project will make a positive contribution to these key EU environmental objectives by developing and testing a product made from a recycled material that is more effective than sand at filtering drinking water.

AFM is a new and innovative method of filtering water using recycled glass. Using properties of glass that resist bacteria build up and contamination that adversely affects standard sand filters, this filtration medium has proved to be highly effective at removing bacteria, parasites and organic matter from water filters tested in several different systems, including sewage treatment plants, swimming pools, drinking water and large aquariums. Although the product is more expensive than the sand equivalent, the medium has a longer lifespan and, as a much more effective filter, has health and safety benefits. 

The medium has been approved by the Drinking Water Inspectorate, and opportunities for use within the water industry, along with the treatment of sewage effluent, have opened up as a result.

Designation as a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) also will not protect the site from pollutants other than nitrogen (e.g. phosphorus and soil particles). Unless the local community is encouraged to take responsibility for the state of the river and its associated habitats, and to instigate a voluntary response to tackle the problems facing the river, significant damage may be done to its natural heritage in future years.

Similar sites exist throughout the EU, where diffuse pollution sources make protection through top-down regulation problematic. New approaches to environmental protection in these areas are now needed."

The target area for the project would be the central London Boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark, The City of Westminster and The Corporation of London, covering the major business districts of central London.
This project intended to maximise the potential for the refurbishment and repair of waste IT for reuse by collecting the waste IT followed by the reclamation of equipment. Such an approach would move the handling of waste IT and office equipment up the waste hierarchy in accordance with EU guidance on waste management.
There were more than 75 000 businesses located within the project area, disposing of an estimated 15 000 items of waste IT and office equipment per annum. Previous experience suggested that as much as 50% could be redistributed with little or no refurbishment, whilst a further 30% could be redistributed following minor repair, or replacement of non-working components."

It is rare that such a large area of chalk grassland still exists in this part of the country. Most will have been a prime target for agricultural improvement schemes. But Salisbury Plain was spared this fate thanks to its strategic importance to the British army. It is in fact the UK’s prime military training area. As a consequence, the impact of intensive modern agriculture has been very limited compared to the wider countryside. But the particular restrictions in land uses imposed by military exercises have had their down side too. Much of the area is suffering from management neglect – invading scrub, insufficient grazing, areas of over-grazing, fragmentation, etc."

A high proportion of the active blanket bog in the pSCI remains in excellent condition. However, parts were still being seriously damaged in the late 1990s as a result of past activities (large-scale afforestation and drainage) and to a lesser extent by on-going management practices (for example, grazing and burning).

The greatest threat came from forestry plantations that lay just outside the SAC/SPA boundaries. Action was urgently required if this particular damage was to be stopped. The next three to five years of the new decade presented the last opportunity to restore afforested peatland with an optimal chance of success, as the forest canopy would close and finally shade out what remained of the peatland vegetation community."

Two centuries later, the picture was quite different: heaths covered only 14% of their former range and what remained was torn apart by new land uses – agricultural land, large urban areas and conifer plantations. The 420,000 residents of the Poole - Bournemouth conurbation put particular pressure on the 1850 ha of nearby heaths.  Fires were deliberately set, vegetation was trampled underfoot by people, horses and mountain bikes etc. and many sites were used as illegal dumps to get rid of old rubbish. The public's perception of these habitats was clearly negative: these areas were nothing more than wastelands.
 
Innovative approaches were required to change such attitudes. The heath fragments that remained were so small and vulnerable that there was little benefit in trying to protect them, or introducing classic conservation measures to restore them, without assuring local cooperation. Their status as a habitat of international importance is rarely recognised."
132,919,Air Products PLC,541894.29,162568.29,"Description
Laboratory and small-scale pilot R &amp; D on the optimisation of the membrane bio-reactor operation shows that, by combining the membrane filtration and the aeration into one stage, there is as much as 50% reduction in energy consumption.  In addition, the passage of the gas-liquid mixture through the reactor reduces the rate of membrane fouling, and the amount of noxious chemicals used for membrane washing is halved.
This project focuses on the scale-up of this innovative process integration to a pre-industrial size. The project will be organised in the following sequence:
1. During the first 6 months prepare a process flow diagram, design a hazard review procedure, design the prototype, source and order the equipment, construct the prototype and commission it off-site.
 Deliverables: Pre-industrial scale demonstration plant ready
2. Conduct detailed demonstration work, involving the market refining, site selection and preparation, training and operating the prototype. Introduce systems for monitoring, data collection and analysis. Consecutive demonstration work at an abattoir/meat rendering facility and at a fine chemical plant, 6 months for each.  These trials will be conducted in situ on a ""no-fee"" basis, it being assumed by the host organisations that they would ultimately benefit from their participation. 
 Deliverables: Validation of all key benefits as forecast by laboratory and small pilot trials.
3. Prepare dissemination material (brochures, case studies and handbooks. The dissemination work itself will be undertaken by Air Products International Sales and Marketing organisation.
Deliverables: All key environmental benefits are in a published form and disseminated.
Scope and Objectives
Existing membrane bioreactors (MBRs) offer environmental advantages over the conventional activated sludge plants for treating industrial effluents.  This LIFE supported project is designed to demonstrate that an innovative single-stage process will be even more beneficial.
The project, which is expected to take about 20 months, comprises the design, engineering and demonstration of a pre-industrial scale MBR at two production sites - a chemical processing plant and an abattoir/meat rendering unit.
Laboratory research and small-scale pilot studies indicate that the new single-stage process will demonstrate the following environmental benefits.
1. Reduced level of discharge of Noxious Chemicals - the membranes used in the current two-stage process require frequent washing and treatment with strong acids, alkalis, hypochlorite solutions and alkaline detergents.  The proposed process should reduce the level of usage of such chemicals by 50%.
2. Reduced Energy Demand - The MBR process requires a high-energy input for aeration operation (through air compression, turbine agitation and jet aerator) and recirculation of waste water for membrane filtration. By combining the two stages, the same energy would be used for both aeration and cross-flow membrane filtration thereby reducing the energy consumption by about 50%.
3. More Economical - Cost savings will result from lower energy consumption, reduced usage of cleaning chemicals and longer membrane life.  This, in turn, will lead to increased usage of MBR treatment facilities, not just in Europe but in less-developed countries.
A large and pre-industrial scale demonstration and dissemination of the above benefits are needed for a wider application of this innovative process so that its environmental contribution can be realised across the EU."
133,1307,Berkshire Gravure Company Limited,698533.46,91543.08,"The printing industry in the Europe Union emits large amounts of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC's) in gaseous form into the atmosphere. The main source of these emissions is gravure, flexography, screen printing, and lacquer application. Most printers are located in or near urban areas, where VOC's combine rapidly with automotive sources of oxides of nitrogen to form low-level ozone and peroxylacetyl nitrate. These compounds are significant contributors to the photochemical smog which blights many European towns and cities.

Legislative requirements of the UK Government and European Community came into effect at the end of 1998 to regulate and reduce solvent emissions from industries to help to improve air quality.  Within Europe, in order to comply with new Directives, companies undertaking gravure, flexography, screen printing, and those involved in lacquer application, have been seeking new and innovative technologies to reduce and treat their VOC emissions. The UK printing industry is estimated to produce 31.5 kt VOC's (UK Government figure) largely from printing companies undertaking gravure, flexography and screen printing and those involved in lacquer application. Within the UK, the printing industry has a regulatory target to reduce VOC emissions to below 150 mg of carbon per m3 of air.

Operating in the very competitive world market for food wrappings, and based in a rural location, CPC Stroud Flexibles recognised a need for a solution to VOC emissions control from gravure printing that offered significant cost savings and environmental benefits over other abatement systems."

As a consequence, there is increasing demand for the development of reliable, inexpensive and environmentally considerate technologies for the treatment of industrial wastewaters.

Adsorption is a process by which a dissolved contaminant (the adsorbate) may be trapped upon a solid surface (the adsorbent) and thus, removed from solution. Many existing processes reply upon adsorption to facilitate the treatment of wastewaters. However, the relatively high cost of conventional adsorbent materials (e.g. activated carbon) can often prohibit their application.

New research has shown that waste biomass materials, namely crab shell (discarded after the extraction of meat) and dealginated seaweed (discarded after extraction of alginate; a thickening agent), can exhibit absorbent properties with respect to certain pollutants. Both these materials are produced as wastes by the European food industry and currently present a significant disposal problem."
135,1306,"Environmental Planning, Cheshire County Council",4836611.67,2362583.26,"Wildlife conservation across much of Europe has traditionally focused on the protection of key sites. It is now recognised that this approach, on its own, will be insufficient to ensure the conservation of all valued habitats and species, much of which survives in the wider landscape outside protected areas. Even protected areas themselves are suffering as activities in the surrounding hinterlands all too often exert negative influences on the wildlife and habitats within them through pollution, water abstraction, road kills and the creation of barriers to the movement and migration of wildlife.

Since the 1970s, a fresh and alternative approach has been emerging in parts of Europe which not only protects important wildlife sites, but also enlarges them through the restoration of habitats and links them through the creation of corridors and stepping stones for the dispersal and migration of species. The concept of ""ecological networks"" is already being developed in several Pan-European countries. It is fundamental to Action Theme 1 of the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy, and is implicit in Articles 3 and 10 of the 1992 Habitats Directive."

Often however, the SDI's that are developed are technical in nature and not easily understood by the public. By developing a set of SDI's with the community (CSDI's), that reflect the issues of concern to the general public, and by ensuring that information is easily understood, the indicators will be of more value to citizens. Finally, the dissemination of the community indicators will be most effective and adapted better to the individual areas if published through the local media."
137,1308,Forestry Commission,777183.01,388591.51,"All land use can affect water quality. Forestry operations can affect aquatic ecosystems negatively in two ways: 
•	through forestry operations e.g. clear cutting and scarification, 
•	through forest design and operations in the near water areas (the riparian zone).

Many of these effects are cumulative; i.e., many small changes may contribute to large total effects and may also be synergistic. Impairment of the freshwater quality also affects the quality of coastal waters. 

However, the full environmental impact of commercial forestry on surface water quality in areas affected by acid deposition has so far been largely neglected. This problem is Europe wide. Forestry is a large scale land use in Sweden and in several other less densely populated European countries. In the UK and other European countries it is smaller in scale, but is carried out mainly on marginal agricultural land – fragile hill and mountain watersheds, lower riparian and other poor drainage areas that are sensitive to changes in acidity. These less intensively managed areas are often areas of high biodiversity. It is becoming increasingly clear that management of water quality and biodiversity in freshwater habitats requires the adjustment of forestry methods."
138,1562,Groundwork Foundation,459506.57,221572.72,"In eighteenth and nineteenth century Europe, there was a transition from an agrarian to an industrial economy. This fundamentally changed the nature of land use from a ""resource to be husbanded so as to sustain productivity and fertility for future generations"" to a ""commodity to be exploited for the mineral wealth beneath it and for accommodating the residues of industrial production and mineral extraction"" (Handley, 2001). The end of the twentieth century has witnessed an increasing transition from a conventional manufacturing-based industrial economy to an economy increasingly based on high-technology processes and on knowledge and services. This has brought changes to the pattern of land use with a dramatic increase in the extent of ""brownfield land"".

 There are many areas of damaged and under-used land located around the older industrial centres of the EU. While some sites can be recycled for urban development, this is often impractical because of low capability and poor market demand. Local people, who are often themselves socially and economically disadvantaged, have a strong interest in the sustainable regeneration of such sites because restoration enhances local image and community confidence, and can provide opportunities for job creation. Despite some progress, the adoption of genuine participative and ecologically-informed approaches to land restoration is still exceptional, resulting from inertia in current practice, difficulty in obtaining funding, and in particular from lack of information, technical guidance and support for local authorities and communities."

At its peak in the 1970's the plant employed 500 staff and produced 9000 tonnes of explosives annually.

The environmental issues which affect the industry when using conventional materials and processes are: 

Manufacturing Losses: The greatest damage to the environment occurs when the finished product is not of saleable quality and is scrapped. In this situation all the raw materials, energy and other resources expended in the production of those items are irretrievably wasted since the scrap is normally sent to landfill. By comparison with other industry sectors, loss levels in tableware manufacture are very high with scrap levels as high as 15-20% not uncommon. 

Raw Material Waste Management: Scrap levels for green bodies (i.e. before firing) are high (typically 5%) by comparison to other process industries but at this stage the majority of the materials can be recycled within the factory. However, in the average factory about 2% of body raw materials cannot be recovered and are discharged either as water-borne effluent or are reduced to solid and sent to landfill. Scrap body materials that have been fired (biscuit), typically accounting for 10% of production, can seldom be recycled and are therefore, also sent to landfill. 

Plaster Usage: Traditionally, all forming methods employed moulds made from plaster of Paris. Each plaster mould has an average useful life of about 100 cycles and no reliable way has yet been found for reconstituting the plaster and reusing it to make new moulds. Many scrap moulds are sent to landfill. Some initiatives exist for recycling the plaster in the construction industry, for use in the manufacture of plasterboard etc. 

Energy Consumption: A recent survey of energy usage in the UK ceramics industry showed that natural gas accounts for 84% of total energy consumption in the tableware sector, with electricity providing 15% (oil &amp; coal together account for only 1%), only 7% using waste heat from the kilns. This is still a very low number but the use of waste heat has increased in recent years. 

Generation of Noxious &amp; Greenhouse Gases: The use of natural gas for drying and firing in a tableware factory causes the release of substantial quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapour directly into the atmosphere. 

Water: A significant part in the tableware manufacturing process is the use of water. The body and glaze suspensions are prepared with solids contents of approximately 46% by weight i.e. 54% water content. Thus for each tonne of finished product, approximately 1 tonne of water must be extracted by filter pressing and in ware dryers. Traditionally, water from the ware dryer is vented to atmosphere as steam, wasting both water and heat. 

Hydrogen Fluoride Emissions: Fluorine is present as an integral component in most types of clay and cannot be removed before use. This fluorine is released from the clay, primarily as gaseous hydrogen fluoride (HF), on firing above 750°C. Atmospheric hydrogen fluoride is now recognised as a health hazard and as a nuisance to the environment. The recommended upper limit on HF concentration in the kiln flue gases (soon to be a legal requirement) is 10 mg/m3. 

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC): These occur in most forms of the materials used in decorating tableware. The VOC's are normally burned-off in the firing process with the combustion products being vented to atmosphere. There is no reliable data on the quantities of VOC's that are emitted by the tableware industry."
143,1432,The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,2108110.30,1052044.45,"Past river management in Europe has drained floodplain wetlands and isolated rivers from their floodplains. Problems such as flooding, water shortages and over-enrichment of water have been made worse in places from this approach. In recent years many people have come to realise that rivers cannot be managed in isolation from their floodplains, nor can rivers and their floodplains be treated without considering the demands put upon them by agriculture, industry, nature conservation and other interests. 

The EU Water Framework Directive  (2000/60/EC) aims to solve these problems by introducing integrated river basin planning and requiring Member States of the EU to meet new ecologically based objectives on the quality of water. The sustainable management of floodplains, a crucial part of the water cycle, is fundamental in meeting these objectives. Member States face particular problems in implementing the Water Framework Directive, in particular from:

 A lack of guidance on methods for appraisal of the effects of restoration and management options
 The need to align European and national policy to facilitate the implementation of the Directive
 A lack of guidance and case study examples of how to facilitate integrated planning and management

A transnational partnership involving 16 partners in 6 Project Areas was set up in order to design and deliver a  project to try and meet some of these needs."

Similar slate waste tips are found throughout the UK and in France, Spain and Germany, and there are many non-toxic mineral extraction sites throughout the EU. Little of this land will be used for residential or commercial development, but sites are often in areas of high quality landscape and are suitable for ecological/environmental restoration.

145,346,English Nature,2234433.48,1117217.50,"There’s no denying that the coastline along the eastern shores of the UK is gradually eroding away under the relentless pressure of rising sea levels.  Stories abound of houses literally dropping into the sea and local beauty spots disappearing under the waves. In the early days valiant attempts were made to combat this problem head-on: blockades and artificial barriers were put up to prevent the sea from making further incursions inland. But, as it turned out, this just shifted the problem elsewhere. It had to be recognised that the forces driving coastal change are so powerful that it is not sustainable to resist them. 

So now the policy is one of ‘managed retreat’. This, however, has several implications for Natura 2000 sites, many of which are located along the English coastline.  Ensuring that the overall ecological requirements of the Natura 2000 sites are maintained in the long term requires that losses are made good by gains elsewhere, for instance, through the re-creation of areas with similar habitats. 

This LIFE project developed a strategic approach to integrating the management of flood risk with the ecological needs of Natura 2000.  This would enable the UK Government to meet the obligations of Article 6(2) of the Habitats Directive - namely to avoid deterioration of natural habitats and the habitats of species - even at the cost of losing individual sites. 
The project was a collaborative effort between two public bodies: English Nature and the Environment Agency, operating under the guidance of an advisory group comprising nine other organisations including the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association and several conservation organisations."
146,470,Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,1364840.52,682419.50,"Saline lagoons are a priority habitat under the Habitats Directive and now total just 1300 hectares within the UK.  They are subject to ongoing degradation and loss through natural and man-induced processes.  Threats include development pressure, pollution, erosion, disturbance and disruption to salinity and water exchange processes.  

Saline lagoons also provide nesting sites for internationally significant concentrations of terns (Sterna spp.) and gulls (Larus spp.) and feeding and roosting sites for migrant populations of waders and wildfowl.  Breeding populations of the avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta, an Annex I bird, are virtually confined to this habitat in the UK.  Threats specific to the bird populations present on the sites include vegetation encroachment, erosion, predation and human disturbance. 

Because of the importance of the habitat, a saline lagoons action plan has been established as part of the UK’s Biodiversity Action Plan.   The aim of this LIFE project was to give a significant initial boost to the plan by maintaining and enhancing the conservation of saline lagoons and their birds on 10 English Natura 2000 sites."
147,550,English Nature,2241038.88,1120519.44,"The conservation of river systems is a complex and challenging task.  They are subject to a wide range of manmade pressures, with the result that many associated habitats and species deemed to be of importance at a European level have declined across their natural range.  Yet, compared to other habitat systems, relatively little is known about the ecological dynamics and requirements of rivers and the species that live in them.  This project focused on 7 pSCI rivers in different parts of the UK, totalling around 872 km.  Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera. They also represent a typical cross section of the different land uses, socio-economic users and threats associated with rivers in the UK, and indeed in the rest of Europe.

This LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. 

First, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.  Ultimately, the project aimed to develop techniques for addressing key issues associated with river conservation and demonstrate best practice which could then be widely disseminated within the UK and other Member States."

Removal of limestone pavement stone for decorative use in domestic gardens has been the main threat to these habitats in the past, but there is now also a growing concern about the impact of commercial afforestation with non-native species.  The needle fall and shade of the closing canopy is leading to a significant deterioration of the habitats.  Loss of traditional woodland management practices is also resulting in the gradual decline in species diversity at these sites.

150,1300,Econo Tek Recycling Ltd,2626866.39,613771.08,"It is the objective of the project to recycle waste foundry sand which is currently discarded to landfill, with the further intention of excavating previously discarded foundry sand and restoring it for re-use by the foundry industry and other end users. It is anticipated that the project will recycle for re-use approx. 90% of all waste sand processed and will reduce by this same amount, the quantity being discarded to landfill. Additional benefits are derived from the reduction in excavating virgin sand for use by the foundry industry.Despite claims by the foundry industry that they currently recycle a high degree of process sands, there is still in excess of 9,000,000 tons being discarded to landfill each year throughout Europe. Some 15% of this total is generated in the UK alone.
In addition to recycling all types of sand currently in use by the foundries, the project displays the ability to remove previously discarded sand from landfill and restore '.
Therefore, the objectives are threefold :
Recycle all types of sand arising from the foundry industry.
Recycle sand from existing landfills to allow restoration for the benefit of the local community.
Reverse the current trend of new sand excavation from virgin land.
The project intention is pre-industrial to demonstrate the methodology attached to proving an effective laundering system for foundries and other sand users in a selected radius by utilising innovative applications of cryogenic and low thermal technology. 
The methodology has been developed through a working consortium between Econotek, a specialist recycling company (SME), Biwater  (Clay Cross), a major area foundry, Air Products, Ashland Foundry Products and the information provision by Simpson Technologies. By maximising the knowledge of all participating companies, a process system involving multi-stage attrition, low temperature rotary thermal and cryogenic technique has been developed which is capable of absolute cleansing of contaminated sands at approx. 16 tons per hour with a sand recovery rate of some 90%.
With restoration facility combined with high tonnage retrieved then the 'multiple foundry laundering system' will  succeed where other facilities have failed. The surplus sand generated by restoring the existing landfill operations will become available to alternative users in the asphalt or cement industries which will assist in reversing the levels of new sand supply.
The reproduction level is high and can be maximised by selective siting throughout Europe."
151,1166,SATRA Technology Centre,840597.24,420298.62,"The term Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) describes a carbon containing substance that readily evaporates or is emitted into the atmosphere. VOC's can be found in both domestic and industrial applications, including transport, household chemicals, paints and adhesives. The emission of VOC's into the atmosphere has been found to contribute to a number of environmental problems, including acid rain formation, ozone layer depletion, the Greenhouse Effect, and ozone production leading to smog and haze.

The furniture industry has for over 50 years made widespread use of VOC's or organic solvents. Lacquers, varnishes, adhesives and cleaners use solvents, with nearly 350,000 tonnes ending up in the atmosphere. A forthcoming EC Directive will require substantial reductions in emissions from adhesives and coating processes. The industry is able to use solvent free alternatives for some processes. However, solvents are widely used by the industry for other processes, especially surface coating of wood and metal, and in adhesion of foam materials."

Although the mercury content of new lamps is steadily being reduced, it cannot be removed altogether under current lamp manufacture technology, and the continuous accumulation of mercury at landfill sites presents a growing hazard. Many organisations replace their fluorescent lamps in bulk prior to the end of service life, which results in the disposal of operational lamps. Preliminary research has confirmed that these lamps can be re-used, rather than contributing towards the unnecessary depletion of resources needed to make new lamps. By providing a sustainable economic framework for the responsible disposal of dead lamps, the project should engage organisations for whom the safe disposal of such waste would normally be economically unfeasible. Significant economic and education benefits should be available to those schools and community groups that participate in the project. The latter is particularly relevant in the context of the importance of environmental education to the UK's national school curricula. By offering an environmentally-responsible 'cradle to grave' management policy for the use of fluorescent lamps, the hope is that the scheme can be reproduced throughout the UK and Europe."

EPS/EPP packaging materials are robust, lightweight and adaptable for use with a wide range of goods, often offering significant advantages over other forms of packaging, including those derived from renewable sources.  Taking account of its many useful packaging applications, the most environmentally sound practice is to promote the maximum re-use of EPS/EPP followed by recycling. 

Directive 94/62/EC lays down requirements for management of packaging waste. It specifies that by 30 June 2001, at least 50% of packaging waste should be recovered and 25% recycled. 

This project was established to assess the technical and economic viability of greater re-use of EPS/EPP packaging by conducting a pilot study in the consumer electrical goods sector. It was proposed that the study would establish a viable scheme based upon the development and use of high quality, preferably standardised, EPS/EPP packaging materials. Working internationally in partnership with industry, the project also aimed to devise a practical model recovery scheme, enabling manufacturers and retailers to re-use a high proportion of their packaging materials and so reduce their overall packaging costs in the medium term. Reusable Packaging International ltd. would manage the project.

158,911,Scottish Natural Heritage,475838.08,237018.40,"The aim of the Moray Firth project was to develop and implement a programme of integrated coastal zone management that actively involved communities and brought together voluntary and statutory measures. The project piloted this approach at three levels: local residents, sub-areas and the regional level. The project area included the 800 kilometres of coastline from Duncansby Head to Fraserburgh and the adjacent territorial waters.

The project was delivered through the Moray Firth Partnership (MFP), a voluntary coalition made up of representatives from industry, the local authorities, conservation bodies, recreation and tourism groups, local residents and many others interested in the future well-being of the Firth. The MFP was formed in 1995 in response to The UK Biodiversity Action Plan. By the start of the LIFE project in 1998, it had already made substantial progress towards devising an agreed strategy and management guidelines for the Firth as a whole. Although results were relatively good, tensions emerged when trying to blend voluntary and statutory measures. In particular, it became clear that without strong support at grass roots level for an integrated approach, it would be inevitable that political pressures and sensitivities would limit the progress that could be made. The MFP therefore identified grass roots support for, and involvement in, the integrated management process as being a vital prerequisite for further achievements. With this in mind, a project was devised to re-define and re-orientate integrated coastal zone management for the Moray Firth to make it fundamentally a bottom-up process that would, in time, bring with it the necessary political support."

161,336,Scottish Natural Heritage,1005176.61,502588.30,"Scotland does not immediately conjure up images of vast tracts of native woodlands, yet it does harbour important proportions of a number of priority forest habitat types listed in the Habitats Directive. Two such habitats - bog woodland and residual alluvial forests - have become particularly rare in recent times.  This project took a comprehensive approach towards their conservation by targeting all three of the remaining bog woodland sites in Scotland and two of the three residual alluvial forest sites.
 
Despite the fact that these five sites are the best examples of these priority habitat types in Scotland, all have experienced interference with the hydrological systems upon which they depend. Bog woodland sites have been drained for agricultural and forestry use whilst land uses within their immediate water catchment have affected the quality of the water coming into the bog.  Residual alluvial forests have been more heavily affected by engineering works to prevent flooding. Also, water use and drainage upstream has altered the water quality and seasonal flooding patterns. On top of that, many areas have been cleared for arable farming and grazing or planted with commercial trees.

The project, through collaboration between public agencies and land owners, was to encourage the reinstatement of more natural hydrological systems at these sites. Appropriate land management was to be promoted on adjacent areas through the restructuring of surrounding plantation forests and the creation of buffer zones of native woodlands. Exotic shrubs were to be removed or controlled to allow the regeneration of natural communities. Grazing pressure was to be reduced by stock fencing. Management agreements with landowners would enable the reclamation of key demonstration floodplain sites for conservation."

The project focused on 15 sub-sites altogether covering approximately 40% of the total pSCI (as it was in 1999). These are situated in and around the Kielder Forest which is the largest man made forest in Northern Europe. They are also home to five annex I bird species, such as golden plover Pluvialis apricaria, golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos, and perigrine falcon falco peregrinus which will benefit substantially from the improvements to the quality of the habitat. 

In the past, agricultural drainage and afforestation have encroached onto the blanket bogs and resulted in drying out and degradation of the habitat. However, one positive aspect of the proximity of the forest is that grazing animals have been excluded and burning has not been carried out for over 30 years so much so that the blanket mire has a naturalness that is almost unique in the UK.The project was run by a partnership of government and non-governmental bodies and most of the actions carried were non recurring. Thus, ditches were blocked to reinstate the integrity of the bogs' hydrological systems, trees were cut and removed on some 200ha to enlarge the blanket bog area and finally naturally regenerated trees were removed from open bog. Since the project was also be breaking new ground with mire rehabilitation on previously afforested areas, there was a lot of interest by both forestry and conservation organisations on the project's successes. Two workshops were organised to present the results of the project and to promote further networking both within the UK and in the rest of Europe.

EU-LIFE co-financing provided a vital initial investment for the long term conservation of this unique site. Once the trees are removed and the ditches blocked the natural processes of peat formation will take over and, in time, the blanket bogs will become self sustaining."
163,897,ARUN District Council,334307.51,159883.10,"Sea bathing is one of the most popular recreational activities in Europe, with millions of Europeans visiting thousands of beaches each year, from the Baltic coast to the Mediterranean. However, over the past two decades an increase in recreational water use has been coupled with a growing apprehension about the dangers of bathing in waters contaminated by domestic sewage discharges.

Contamination of coastal waters can take many forms, impacting on recreational areas as either diffuse or point source pollution, but it is of greatest concern when it results in the potentially health-threatening spread of infectious diseases. The issue of coastal pollution is high on the agenda of most European coastal authorities because of the economic importance of tourism and coastal recreation, whilst the full impact of coastal pollution on public health remains uncertain.

Although illness associated with seawater contact can be caused by viruses discharged with sewage, these pathogens are difficult and expensive to test for. Therefore it is common practice to test for other microorganisms, which are thought to indicate the presence of sewage, but are easier and cheaper to test for. 

This preparatory action will determine the relationship between enterovirus and coliphage populations and how Faecal streptococci, Escherichia coli and the total coliform group also interact with coliphage and enterovirus populations following sewage discharge to receiving waters. The work will allow more accurate predictive models for the dispersion of sewage discharges to be produced and enable better assessment of their impact on the public health of recreational water users.

To date, problems of inner-city deprivation have not been solved and, if anything, are becoming worse rather than better. This has been brought up at all levels, in an attempt to change both policy and practice relating the management of urban areas. 

To monitor change in urban areas, and to look at how quality of life was changing, indicators are being used at all levels. In the EU, the Expert Group on the Urban environment was re-launched and the first topic-oriented working group was to develop a set of Indicators for Local Sustainability aimed at encouraging local authorities to monitor and assess the performance of their policies in terms of quantitative and qualitative outcomes on the ground. In the UK, the national set of headline indicators aimed to focus public attention on what sustainable development meant and to monitor how changes were occurring throughout the country. At a more local level, indicators could be used to inform, raise awareness, encourage improvements and get people involved in sustainability processes. 

The London Borough of Southwark has growing prosperity in the north of the borough, established wealth in the residential area of Dulwich Village in the south and, in complete contrast, significant unemployment and disadvantage in the centre.  For example, the unemployment rate in Walworth and Peckham was 11.5%; almost double the then British average of 5.9%. Nearly 50% of families were single parent families and one in four households had an income of under £100 per week. The areas were also faced with significant problems due to relatively high levels of anti-social behaviour, traffic congestion, and air pollution. These areas are highly cosmopolitan with a rich diversity of communities ­ over two thirds of households are from a black or ethnic minority group. Walworth and Peckham are home to a significant number of new arrivals from Albania, Bosnia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Ivory Coast, Kosovo, Nigeria, Poland, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, Somalia, Turkey, Uganda and Vietnam. 

The Walworth and Peckham areas were both the subject of major urban regeneration initiatives aimed at improving the quality of life of these areas. In Peckham, a seven year £250 million urban regeneration programme, the Peckham Partnership, was underway to give a new lease of life to the area's five housing estates and 10,000 people. The programme, one of the largest in Britain, adopted an integrated approach to urban regeneration and focused on community safety, education, health, leisure, employment and training as well as physical regeneration of the area.
  
The Aylesbury Estate in the centre of Walworth, home to 12,000 inhabitants, was the subject of urban regeneration activity focusing on education, employment, community safety and strengthening the community. Further funding under the British Government's ""New Deal for Communities"" would enable physical regeneration of the area, known as the ""Aylesbury Plus"", to begin in the near future."

166,1017,Subterra Limited,963718.01,274545.58,"Groundwater is a major source of potable water in Europe. In England and Wales it accounts for around 30% of all drinking water supply and is also widely used for industrial, agricultural, domestic and other purposes.

Leaking sewers have long been suspected as an important source of groundwater contamination, particularly in urban areas. The pollution threat posed to groundwater by sewage and sewerage systems has been recognised for many years. Recently several causes of the deterioration of groundwater have been studied. A number of European studies have revealed (using close circuit television) the often very poor condition of the sewer pipework infrastructure. German research has indicated that some 10% to 15% of the 285,000 kms of public sewers and 600,000kms of private sewers in the former area of West Germany have exceeded their life expectancy. It has also been estimated that approximately 300 million m3 of wastewater seeps into the groundwater each year.

Replacement of existing defective sewer networks is expensive, particularly in urban areas. Over the past 30 years, cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) lining systems have been developed for the insitu repair of leaking, and structurally unsound buried sewer networks. These CIPP systems typically comprise a felt tube impregnated with a suitable resin that is inflated in an existing, defective sewer pipe and cured in place to form a pipe within a pipe, either at ambient temperature, or by using hot air, hot water, steam, or UV light.

It has however been recognised that the use of full length CIPP systems can be wasteful of resources, since in many cases the defect to be treated is localised within a individual sewer length. As a consequence, short, part-liner systems (usually referred to as patch liners or patches) have been developed. These can provide a higly cost-effective means of restoring the structural integrity of sewers and/or resolve infiltration and exfiltration.

However, key problems of the existing patch repair systems include:

- it is difficult to ensure consistent product quality on site under all likely environmental conditions
- significant risk of spillage of uncured resin materials on site, and consequently damage to the environment
- slow, expensive and inflexible process
- the patch materials have to be 'wetted-out' on site with the uncured resin which inter alia results in high costs of energy and risks of styrene emissions.

Most of the existing sewer patch repair systems rely on either ambient curing or heat curing of the resin, once the prepared patch is positioned over the defect. Both of these processes tend to be relatively slow, typically up to one hour. During this time the patch installation equipment must remain tied to the patch being installed and cannot be removed to the next repair site until the patch has cured sufficiently.

This project aimed to demonstrate a localised sewer patch repair system with UV-cured-in-place-patches systems, which would use ultra-violet to cure factory-prepared liners. The technology would be demonstrated in close cooperation with a Water Services Company."

It has been estimated that this process generates 100,000 tonnes of leather waste, most of which is disposed of by landfill or incineration. However, increasing legislation and environmental concern is resulting in these disposal options becoming more difficult and hence more expensive. The European Footwear industry is already under price pressure from South America and Asia and increasing costs due to waste disposal will hinder the ability of a company to compete on the world market.

An industry wide approach would help to identify viable means of recycling leather, particularly finished leather. This would benefit not only footwear manufacturers but also industries such as furniture and automobiles.

Efforts have already been made to recover useful materials from waste leather, such as chromium compounds by incineration and proteins by chemical digestion, or to use it as a filler in bricks and concrete, but these have not yet led to significant commercial processes.

This project therefore sought to recycle waste leather with minimum pretreatment to produce commercially viable novel materials that could be used in the industry which generated the original waste, or other industrial sectors using similar materials."

There is an obligation to secure a 30% reduction in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions by 1999 because they are major precursors of ground level ozone. In common with many companies the proposer needs to address the problem for emissions of VOCs from its industrial processes. The company is developing an integrated approach to its environment strategy embracing a three pronged approach: limiting at source the release of pollutants, integration of energy requirements with the reduction of environmental emissions, abatement techniques involving end of pipe solutions and recycling wherever possible. In this context this project is proposed to demonstrate the use for a novel absorption process for reducing medium to high VOC emissions to air. The technology would be applicable to VOC mixtures consisting of Alkanes, Alkenes, Aliphatic and Aromatic Hydrocarbons. Halogenated Hydrocarbons, Aldehydes, Ketones, Alcohols, Amines and others. The system utilises the most advanced developments in absorption technology relating to VOC abatement. The VOC materials are absorbed into a Polyethylene Glycol based oil and then stripped with steam to recover the VOCs. The process is unique in that it has characteristics which enable flexibility of response to plant operating conditions and a turndown ration not available from other technologies. It is also anticipated that in some applications the stripped VOCs may be recycled. The principal anticipated results of the project can be summarised as a demonstration that the technology will achieve abatement of Composite Resins Plant vent streams.It is anticipated that the process will reduce the current emissions of 36-38 tonnes/year by 95% or more.

However, as a result of changes in agricultural practices these valuable wetland areas have become neglected and, through natural succession to woodland, there have been losses of biodiversity, landscape and recreational assets.

Since maintaining these environmental assets depends on continued wetland management, including regular removal of the standing crop, much attention has recently been directed towards the formulation and operation of sustainable management strategies for wetlands.

173,249,Hampshire County Council,7488389.67,3744911.76,"Originally created as a hunting forest by William the Conqueror in the 11th century, the 'New' Forest is an extensive site covering nearly 300 km². It is probably best known as an area of ancient woodland and swathes of 'open forest' grazed by roaming herds of New Forest ponies. Its EU nature conservation interest lies in its 13 habitat types (including the priority habitats bog woodland and alluvial forests) and 3 species of the Habitats Directive and the 5 Annex I Birds Directive species present.  Situated in the densely populated south of England, the New Forest is a magnet to visitors - estimated at 20 million annually. This popularity brings with it problems: recreational pressure causes erosion and disturbance. Afforestation with non-indigenous species leaves a legacy of conifer plantations that are out of keeping with the natural character of the area. Other invasive species like bracken and rhododendron threaten its integrity. 

A Strategy for the New Forest, which was published by the New Forest Committee in April 1996, recognised the European importance of the New Forest and identified a strategic framework for its conservation and enhancement. The LIFE project grew from this initiative.

A consortium of 10 organisations - from graziers and foresters to conservationists - put together an ambitious programme to undertake a wide range of habitat management and restoration measures designed to tackle the key threats to the New Forest. The main targets were to produce a management plan to cover the entire pSCI; to increase the land owned and managed for nature conservation purposes; and to restore 4000 ha of the pSCI habitats to favourable conservation status. Much of the habitat restoration work would involve clearance of rhododendron, removal of planted and invasive conifers, introducing traditional broadleaved woodland management (like pollarding), and repairing/controlling erosion. One of the more innovative elements of the project was the action to secure the long term viability of grazing animals in the New Forest. Since much of the nature conservation interest is bound up with traditional grazing practices - ponies, cattle and pigs - it is important that these should not decline. New Forest pony grazing is thought to be most at risk and project activities thus focused on stock improvement through incentive payments linked to competitions and stock management by pony owners."

Underplanting and replacement of broadleaved deciduous species by exotic conifers; invasive plants like rhododendron; increasing pressure from deer browsing which reduces natural regeneration; and in some areas high visitor numbers, are among the key threats to these ancient oak woodlands.

The project was concerned with improving the habitat condition in seven of the most extensive Atlantic woodlands in Britain, ranging from Loch Maree in the far north-west of Scotland, through the popular Loch Lomond woodlands within easy reach of Glasgow, to Borrowdale woods in the Lake District and Meirionnydd oakwoods in north-west Wales. Together they cover nearly 4,900 ha of Atlantic oakwood habitat.

At each site, a set of management targets was to be established based on the most important perceived threats. Actions would target the clearance of around 690 ha of exotic conifers and broadleaves, treatment of around 405 ha to eradicate rhododendron, and treatment of a further area of over 370 ha to control bracken. Another important activity would be controlling grazing - particularly by sheep, deer and feral goats through a mixture of stock fencing - over 60 km - and deer culling. The effectiveness of the various measures was to be monitored and assessed and the results disseminated on a web-site."

Reputedly the largest spit in Europe, it is also a haven for birds: nearly 40 species breed, migrate or winter over in the area, of which 12 are in Annex I of the Birds Directive. 

It is not just the birds that are attracted to this remote and isolated area. Apart from having stimulated folklore, artists, musicians and poets over the centuries, the place was also a strategically important military site. Owned by the Ministry of Defence until 1973, it was primarily used for military research purposes, including bomb ballistics and firing trials. These all took their toll on the habitats and birds and even today extensive military debris is evident over much of the area. After 1973, unlawful access and activities spread unchecked across the site, resulting in a further dramatic and steady decline in many of the bird species.

This reached such a critical stage that immediate intervention was needed to conserve and restore the area. Having purchased the site in 1994, the National Trust successfully carried out a first series of emergency actions under a LIFE I project (LIFE94NAT/UK/000850), including the large scale removal of all harmful military debris. However, reversing the damage of 60 years of use and neglect is a slow and time-consuming exercise.

The new project was to build upon the successes and results of the first project in order to restore the site to a favourable conservation state."

Dorset is a coastal county and comprises six district authorities. Most of the county's population is concentrated in the main coastal towns, resorts and harbours and the economy depends heavily on tourism, trade, fisheries and defence, all of which are linked to the presence of the sea. Bournemouth, the centre of a substantial conurbation, is an internationally known resort. The majority of the coastline is undeveloped, internationally famous for its geology, rich in scenic beauty and home to a variety of wildlife. It is protected by many landscape and habitat designations and is a prospective World Heritage Site.

The marine environment is shared by all States adjoining the English Channel and issues such as pollution, water quality, shipping, defence contraction, oil exploration, aggregate extraction, rising sea levels, fisheries and marine recreation are common to all. The Dorset Coast Startegy has attempted to deal with these issues, several of which are of pressing importance, as well as those of a more local nature. 

The land and sea are integrally linked, yet the mechanisms for managing reources in the two are fundamentally different. In the UK the well developed planninig and management systems on land contrast markedly with the sectoral approach at sea. In 1993, the UK Government recognised the need for an extension of the ethos of planning and management strategy into the coastal zone and recommended that local authorities take a lead role with other agencies and interest groups in coordinating the preparation of coastal management plans.

In order to ensure the sustainable development of the Dorset coastal zone a widely accepted strategy was required, which would provide the framework for integrated management in the coastal zone."
177,717,BIP Group Limited,574722.94,149376.76,"Faced with increasing legislative pressure to reduce its emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC's), BIP decided to review its processes and options for emission reductions. One major source of emissions arose from BIP's operation for producing amino moulding powders. This process uses simple raw materials; urea, methanol, which is converted to formaldehyde, and paper as the main constituents. The operation leads to the release of VOC's comprising mostly formaldehyde and some unreacted methanol. As a first step towards emission reduction, BIP investigated the source of VOC releases from this operation. Most of the emissions were found to come from the powder drying process. The main air stream from the dryers has a flow rate of 60,000 cubic metres per hour, containing low to medium level VOC's (up to several hundred milligrams per cubic metre of air). To comply with IPPC legislation the concentration of VOC's in the air stream needed to be reduced below 5 mg/cubic metre."
178,1092,University of Ulster,1312006.72,630403.23,"The objective was to set up demonstrations in informed, multisectoral, community based, sustainable management of dune/beach systems in the North and Northwest of Ireland which combined utilisation and conservation in the resulting management plan. These were implemented and used as the core of a dissemination programme designed to inform and influence coastal policy at the European level.

Coastal zone management in Ireland traditionally involves the application of hard engineering techniques for stabilisation of the shoreline. The construction of such structures had resulted in beach loss, beach lowering and erosion of adjacent beaches. 

Recent advances in coastal zone management recognise that human activities have a significant impact on coastlines and erosion.   There was a need to introduce less environmentally intrusive approaches to coastal management  to address this that might include planned landward retreat of activities and infrastructure (such a change could only be implemented through consultation with affected communities), modification of landuse practices or abandonment of areas at risk from erosion.  Such an approach required an understanding of the natural environment and the impacts of  human activities on the environment and participation in the management process by all affected parties.  Underlying this was the need to increase general awareness of the issues and impacts of different courses of action."
179,1388,"City of Edinburgh Council,",291841.49,143616.74,"The Estuary and Firth of Forth is a valuable natural resource. From the tidal water limit at Stirling to the Isle of May at its North Sea entrance, the Forth is 96km long and covers an area of 1,670km2. Its environs are home to over a quarter of Scotland’s population and a diverse range of habitats and wildlife. It is also a major focus for industry, commerce, transport, housing and recreation, which results in an interesting, complex and continually changing regional economy and reflects an important international trading community.

Many of the activities that make the Forth so important can also be damaging to its long-term health. Increasing demands for space and resources make it crucial to find a balance between the interests of people and commerce, and the protection of the natural heritage. The challenge was to ensure that this balance is secured, and that the Forth’s natural resource base is maintained and enhanced by integrating the protection of the region’s environmental quality with continued economic prosperity.

In 1994, the UK government launched a Biodiversity Action Plan, which encouraged the creation of local partnerships promoting the sustainable management of coastal areas. The Forth Estuary Forum was established as a non-statutory management partnership with the aim of achieving integrated coastal zone management for the Estuary and Firth of Forth to prevent ongoing environmental degradation. Membership was open to any organisation or individual with an interest in the Firth of Forth."
180,1121,Buckinghamshire College of Higher Education,665603.41,325121.66,"The importance of Tourfor was related to two key factors. Firstly, forests are high on the environmental agenda. As well as their productive functions, they contribute to global carbon cycles and biodiversity. Secondly, tourism is moving up the environmental agenda. Its rapid growth has forced attention on to its negative impacts as well as its contributions to economic growth. But the potential for co-development exists across these sectors: forests could absorb more tourism by providing increased recreational activities, and tourism could benefit forests by providing social use valuations as well as direct income.

With a positive approach to tourism and recreational management, a harmonious relationship between the visitors and the environment can be formed. If managed carefully, tourism and recreation can help to maintain the environment, rather than inflict damage on it. There exists a relationship of mutual interdependence between tourism, recreation and the countryside environment. 

The Environmental Management System (EMS) which is at the centre of Tourfor, develops an award and guidelines for environmental management that recognises such an interdependence. It seeks to reduce conflict between tourism, recreation and the countryside environment and create a symbiotic relationship.

Tourfor is a response to Agenda 21 and is aimed at environmental improvement at the corporate level. It uses the EMS approach to implant sustainable objectives into organisational missions and encourage systematic delivery of sustainable practices. Among the benefits that such a approach can bring, over and above environmental improvements, are additional information to consumers, assistance in marketing, and help in the reduction of costs."

In order to re-use poultry chiller water it is necessary to have a process which both removes the bacteria and also the organic loading of the water. The SafeQuest Macron Loop was developed in the US to allow significant amounts of water recirculation. The Macron Loop is a mechanical filtration and ozone disinfection process that continually treats a stream of water from poultry chiller baths. The Macron filter removes fats and protein contaminants at 400 US gallons per minute down to a particle size of 25 microns. After filtration, ozone is dissolved into the water to kill contaminating bacteria and oxidise organic matter.

The motivation for the LIFE project was to build on development work on ozone disinfection already carried out in the US and investigate the use of similar water treatment systems in the Europe. In Europe the scale of operation and the ligislative constraints for the poultry industry are different to those in the US. In the European industry broilers are generally air chilled, not water chilled. In the UK the only significant use of water for cooling is in turkey processing. Therefore, BOC and Bernard Matthews Ltd agreed to investigate the application of the technology at Bernard Matthew's Holton turkey processing plant."

183,81,English Nature,4914084.19,2457042.09,"Protecting the key nature conservation interests of marine Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), which around the UK range from coastal lagoons and estuaries to sea caves and reefs, is a complex task. These areas tend to be of high economic value and are heavily used for a host of functions (e.g. fisheries, recreation, industry, etc.). Any of these uses may pose a threat to marine wildlife and habitats. The UK government has adopted legislation (UK Habitats Regulations) which provides for management schemes to be established for marine SACs, designed to make sure that any uses of the sites are compatible with the conservation needs of the habitats and species of European interest. 

The project was to establish the first of these schemes on 12 sites around the UK and pave the way for others.
The selection of the 12 sites targeted by the project reflected the range of habitat types and species for which UK marine SACs had been proposed. Developing management schemes would involve collating information on the features of nature conservation interest, specifying conservation requirements and monitoring needs, and defining the factors (environmental and human activities) affecting site quality. At the end of the project, management schemes were to be established at the 12 selected marine sites. These would define the nature conservation interest of each site and what is required to ensure that the key features – such as bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay or Zostera habitats along the north Norfolk coast - are maintained, how to check for changes and how to respond if detrimental changes are detected.

The project would be operated by a consortium of the UK nature conservation agencies. Its key innovation was the partnership approach with main marine user interest groups and specialists, including port authorities, fisheries authorities, local and regional councils, scientific research institutes and recreational interest groups. 

The experiences gained under this project should also be of benefit to other marine SACs in the EU."
184,119,Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,3756072.64,1878036.31,"Bitterns (Botaurus stellaris) in Europe have declined dramatically during the last century. Habitat loss and deterioration - especially the reduction in Phragmites reedbeds and similar marshlands which are favoured by this large but secretive bird - are among the chief reasons for its general demise, and for its inclusion in Annex I of the Birds Directive. The recent trend to abandon traditional reed management has contributed to the present situation where the haunting, low, booming call of territorial male bitterns is no longer heard, or is heard less frequently, in many lowland wetlands of north-west Europe.

In the UK, where the breeding population has dropped from a mid-1950s peak of around 80 booming males to 16 in 1994, the RSPB has prepared a recovery plan for bitterns. This project aimed to take key elements of this plan and put them into action so as to safeguard and enhance core areas of UK bittern habitat.

To improve the conservation status of this species in Britain, the project would expand the available breeding habitat and improve habitat quality at 13 sites, mostly in East Anglia - the species' current stronghold - and at one outlying site in north-west England. This would be done in partnership with wetland management agencies in both the public and private sectors.

Activities would specifically protect and enhance reedbed habitats; restore degraded reedbed habitats; and create new reedbeds adjacent to existing areas of this habitat. The expected result would be to provide suitable habitat in Britain to support a bittern population that is 2-3 times higher than at present, although it might take longer than the life of the project before the birds take up residence in their improved habitats. Finally, lessons learnt from this project would be shared with other relevant organisations across the EU to assist the implementation of the European bittern action plan."

A MedSPA project (Stage I) created one of the largest known vertical flow constructed wetland wastewater management systems which was commissioned in early 1995 at Nea Madytos, near Thessaloniki, in Northern Greece.  The constructed wetland was designed with alternative operational modes and the works performance is subject to a two year programme of monitoring under LIFE95 (Stage II).  The landscaped features of the works reduce its environmental impact and together with the built-in buffer effects of the system, make it potentially of interest to small towns under seasonal tourist pressure; the plants will grow most vigorously in the tourist season. In addition, provision has been made for the communities to benefit directly from recycled effluent and sludge in their local agricultural and horicultural industries.

The objective of the present project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of constructed wetlands in the treatment of domestic effluent.  The project aims to demonstrate:
· performance at each stage of the treatment plant;
· compliance with relevant effluent standards;
· variation in effluent quality with time and seasons;
· the suitability and effectiveness of the effluent for re-use;
· the performance and practicability of the different modes of operation designed into the scheme.

In particular the emission of trace levels of highly toxic materials such as dioxins and furans is perceived to be a major problem.  Many existing incinerator plants throughout the community will be forced to close unless new off-gas treatment technology is developed and demonstrated.  

Non-thermal plasma technologies have received considerable attention in recent years as an alternative to conventional techniques for gas phase pollution abatement.  When a non-thermal plasma is applied to the off-gas from an incinerator it should be possible to greatly reduce the level of organic emissions and, in particular, to reduce the dioxin and furan levels.

The aim of the project is to fully demonstrate the economic and engineering feasibility of the process.  In order to achieve this goal prior to commercialisation two key areas need to be addressed.  These are efficiency and scaling.  To improve the efficiency of the process the development of a power supply that is well matched to the plasma reactors is vital, this controls the transfer to energy from the circuitry to the plasma.  For scaling, the treated gas flow will be increased by a factor of ten or more to 600-1000 cubic meters per hour.

In the first phase of the project scaling tests were carried out at a Municipal Waste Incinerator.  The result is a high gas flow plasma reactor system together with its associated power supply.  Initial measures of the destruction efficiency will be been carried out.  In the second phase the measurements will be extended to cover the full capability of the system demonstrating high destruction levels at improved efficiency.  The issue of the lifetime of key components such as high voltage switches will also need to be addressed."

ATLAS draws upon previous experience from the Leicester Environment City campaign, which concluded that there are four barriers to be overcome if environmental action is to be taken: the costs of the action must not be prohibitively high; the action must be feasible and relatively convenient; there must be good information about possible actions; and a desire or motivation to take the action must exist.  Within a local authority context there is little that can be done to make action for local sustainability more convenient or affordable, but we can improve information about possible actions and provide training to key decision-makers to increase awareness and motivation.

Under the project, research will be carried out into the issues affecting Common Land Management on 15,000 hectares of common land on Mynydd Du, within the Brecon Beacons National Park. Surveys and research are being carried out on agricultural land use, recreation, vegetation, archaeology, landscape and wildlife.

A key element of the project will be a detailed social survey linked to a series of group discussions with Commoners, other local residents and visitors.  The inclusion of the agricultural community from the beginning of the project is recognised as vital.  These consultations should also provide further insight into people¿s perception of the value of common land which will feed into the management proposals and the development plan.
Practical land management will be carried out by commoners and local contractors.  The intention is to experiment with methods of improved stock management to further the landscape, wildlife, recreation and agricultural values of the commons. These methods are likelly to include improved shepherding, heather management, etc.  Advice will be provided at the major access points onto the commons as an experimental approach to the problems generated by vehicles, mountain bikes and walkers.

The project aims to reconcile the uses of the mountain and produce a plan for future sustainable management.  It is hoped that this will contribute to a blueprint for Common Land Management throughout Europe."

However, where ponds are concentrated in clusters and where pond density is high, they can create a distinctive inter-dependent wetland patchwork of considerable variety and richness. Moreover, ponds are often associated with other types of semi-natural habitats including scrub, semi-natural grassland and marsh. During the last fifty years the pace of agricultural change has accelerated and this has had far-reaching consequences for the rural landscape. Many once commonplace farmland features, such as small water bodies, have been removed whilst those that remain are threatened by a lack of management. It is awareness of, and concern for, these changes that has led to the instigation of this project.
This project has advanced, interpreted and applied the concept of sustainability to the management of small water bodies in agricultural landscapes in the north west of England. The project aimed to:
· offer farmers and land managers an opportunity to use their skills to steward the land and hand it on in good order for future generations;
· encourage local communities to care for their own landscape heritage;
· improve the diversity and local character of the lowland agricultural landscape in North West England amd conserve and extend a declining wildlife habitat;
· focus conservation effort and resources so that they are used to generate public benefit.

The project introduced a major community conservation initiative throughout the region - a local pond warden scheme - in which local people  take on the responsibility of protecting and managing small water bodies in their locality. A ¿Best Practice Manual¿ and supporting ¿Video Package¿ for farmers and local communities has been produced which promotes the sustainable management and restoration of small water bodies in the agricultural landscape."

In this way, the project aims to demonstrate environmental benefits from the utilisation of scrap materials, saving energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing exploitation of natural resources.

The project has developed composite powder materials for spraying at high temperature onto the surface of components in order to extend their life.  The new powders give a unique combination of resistance to wear under corrosive conditions, and under extreme thermal cycling.  Current work is aimed at gathering technical data prior to marketing the powders, and to ensuring consistency from batch to batch.

Within the project, another powder has been developed which is added to steel and then cast into rolls for use in steel rolling mills.  The treated rolls last up to 50% longer than untreated ones.

A by-product is the release into the atmosphere of more than 20 million litres of organic solvents.  These emissions contribute to the formation of photochemical oxidants and stratospheric ozone depletion.  As national and EU legislation to control VOCs takes force, footwear manufacturers need to find new technologies which have the bonding performance they require.  This project is investigating the application of alternative, solvent-free adhesives which, if successful, could also be employed in other industries.  It is also demonstrating catalytic combustion of solvents as an alternative strategy where solvents cannot be displaced.

In the first stage, testing of 12 adhesives and ¿hot melts¿ was carried out on a range of nine footwear material combinations.  Initial results showed that cyanoacrylate adhesives produced poor bonds.  Water-based adhesives and hot melts were more successful and three of each were retained for wear trials.  The adhesives offer good short term prospects since they require little investment by manufacturers.  Trial shoes were made and assessed in preliminary wear trials, and the technology optimised for the factory demonstrations.

In-factory demonstrations of solvent free adhesion were carried out in two UK shoe factories.  Shoes were satisfactorily produced in each style with each of the adhesive systems, although spotting and pressing required care with the hot melts. Wear trials showed very few failures among shoes bonded with water based adhesives. Having successfully demonstrated solvent free bonding and catalytic combustion for men¿s and women¿s footwear production, a further series of demonstrations in a children¿s shoe factory in Greece was organised.

The VOC emissions of interest include those of halogenated solvents.  In quantitative terms, the project aims to demonstrate a reduction in VOC emissions from levels of aproximately 500mg/m3 to below 5mg/m3 , which will define a new EU standard for BAT.  From this project, information will be available to enable the design of a plant that can be incorporated into the manufacturing lines of the process industries.



An integrated solution to the problem of combining solvent capture and recovery with plasma destruction of the remaining VOC in the gas stream is proposed.  The non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma is generated using a patented microwave system.  The electric field is intensified to a level where the gas carrying the solvent is ionised.  The microwave power then heats the released electrons thus producing more ionisation and also high densities of reactive free radicals.  These radicals, together with direct electron impact, destroy the solvent molecules producing compounds that can be easily removed by, for example, standard scrubbing techniques.  

The project is being performed in two phases.  Firstly, a prototype non-thermal plasma system has been designed, constructed and commissioned.  Small scale laboratory studies have indicated that this approach can economically oxidise low concentrations of a range of organic materials.  Secondly, the system has been installed downstream of a solvent condensor at a pharmaceutical process plant.  Trials have been carried out to demonstrate  reduced VOC emissions from pharmaceutical processes when the plasma system is operated in conjunction with solvent capture techniques"

229,832,Devon County Council,1481345.20,740672.60,"This project is concerned with demonstrating approaches towards sustainable tourism within the county of Devon in the UK and the regions of Asturias and Galicia in Spain.  The overall approach has been to pursue a series of targeted demonstration schemes within the context of a strategic overview.  Within Devon these have been developed in conjunction with a wide range of local partners in four distinct areas, each of which has enabled different elements to be pursued.  In Spain the project has been similarly concentrated in three areas of Asturias and in two areas of Galicia.

Between 1994 and 1996, more than one hundred individual sustainable tourism schemes were carried out within the following four major themes:
· managing visitors in sensitive environments;
· promoting sustainable visitor activities;
· diversifying agriculture;
· raising peoples¿ awareness.

Each of these schemes has explored a different facet of tourism development, and together they provide a comprehensive insight into what sustainable tourism can actually mean in practice.  They are very varied and wide-ranging, and include the creation and extension of footpaths, habitat management, environmental auditing of tourism businesses, securing contributions from visitors towards conservation, linking public transport, interpretation and accomodation to networks and working directly with local communities.

A leaflet has been produced which highlights some of the individual achievements and summarises the lessons learnt from the project.  A more extensive Good Practice Guide is also currently being produced, giving details of the most significant schemes and the good practice which they demonstrate."

The Cornwall LIFE Project is developing a demonstration model of an integrated planning and environmental information system for the county of Cornwall in the south west of England.  This project, a partnership between an NGO and a local authority, will provide information to decision makers to assist in the better planning and management of the area¿s resources.

The project is a partnership between the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, Cornwall County Council and the Société Pour l¿Etude et la Protection de la Nature en Bretagne. 

The aim of the project is to demonstrate a cost-effective and efficient way of providing a local environmental information system (EIS).  The EIS will be used to, amongst other things, support the development plan process within local government and to assist in the establishment of a nature conservation plan for Cornwall.  Other groups of users will be encouraged to make use of the system through a range of consultation and promotional activities.  Pilot areas will be established in Brittany to demonstrate the applicability of the system in other areas of Europe.  Specific aims are: to develop protocols for improving consideration of the environment in land use planning; to provide cost-effective methods for monitoring semi-natural habitat; to contribute to strategic plans for nature conservation; and to demonstrate potential methods for establishing local environmental information systems in other parts of Europe.
Material is to be produced for dissemination to other interested partnerships in Europe.  This material will describe the methods used to establish a local environmental information system in Cornwall, and the ways in which this approach could be adopted in other areas of Europe."
231,643,Southwark Council - Development Department,601160.90,291563.04,"Urban air pollution, much of it caused by road traffic emissions, is one of Europe¿s most widespread environmental problems.  Research suggests that a minority of vehicles contribute to a disproportionate amount of pollution, with perhaps 10% of cars generating 50% of emissions.  This project demonstrates the use of remote sensing equipment that identifies such gross polluters, and investigates links between traffic flows and road-side air quality.  It includes educational activities that raise public awareness of air pollution.

Southwark is a busy, built-up area of London which includes a major road corridor carrying traffic from Kent and the South-East into the centre of the city.  The project is managed by Southwark Council in co-operation with Greenwich University and the Metropolitan Police.  Its aims are to raise the public¿s awareness of air pollution from traffic and its effect on health and general environmental quality, to encourage appropriate changes in transport use and vehicle maintenance which help to reduce pollution levels.  It also investigates air pollution problems in busy road corridors and demonstrates the potential role of advanced pollution detection technology in identifying gross polluters and enforcement of standards.

Two pieces of equipment have been tested, the Denver FEAT system and the ¿smog-dog¿.  Both rely on analysis of interference in a reflected infra-red beam to estimate emissions individual vehicles. The project has undertaken a number of trials of the different techniques that could be used to pick out the registration plate of gross polluters with greater accuracy. The project has also linked a road-side monitoring station to a traffic counting device that can identify the class (size) and speed of vehicles independently and simultaneously in each of four lanes of traffic to examine the effect of traffic type and flows on air quality."

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the development and finalisation of new clean technologies for the pulp industry.

The optimisation of the bleaching process will be done, in the final plant, by a Control System with a fuzzy-neural architecture.  To arrive at such architecture, Siemens had to model the bleaching process.  This was done by mathematical modelling, wherever the process was sufficiently known, partly by creating fuzzy rules which evolved and were refined from a set of initial rules provided by the pilot processing plant during the first year.  A major breakthrough was achieved by Siemens during the second year with the linking of these fuzzy rules with a connectionist mechanism for updating them. 

The Control System also required the creation of data acquisition systems both for automatic acquisition of variables measured by sensors at the plant and for mutual input of data gathered off-line (eg lab data).  The On-line Data Acquisition Systems were developed by Siemens and installed at the Caima plant in Portugal.  The Manual Data Acquisition System was developed by BMT and installed by BMT and Caima.  Based on these Data Acquisition Systems, on the Human Computer interface developed by BMT and on statistical Control Charts specially created by BMT and Caima, a manual control system has already been developed and installed to help in the process of sequence installation.  The final control system will be a model predictive controller and is presently being designed by Siemens."
234,951,Natural Environment Research Council - Institute of Freshwater Ecology,1222709.60,611354.80,"Lakes are widely regarded as ideal ¿sentinels¿ of environmental change.  They respond in a predictable way to changes in the catchment and are dominated by biological communities that are strongly influenced by changes in the weather.  In recent years, it has become clear that many of the long-term changes recorded in lakes are driven by climatic processes that operate on a regional or even global scale.  Automatic recording instruments provide the ideal means of recording the responses of lakes to short term variations in the weather.  A variety of water quality monitoring systems are currently used in the water industry but the advantages of combining such measurements with high resolution meteorological records have yet to be fully appreciated.

The main objective of this project was to design and build a buoy based instrument that can be deployed in lakes to monitor the response to changes in the weather.  The system includes a range of meteorological as well as limnological sensors and is designed to transmit this information to a remote operator via a radio link to a telephone line.This project aims to design, construct and test an integrated water quality monitoring system for freshwater lakes and reservoirs. Most of the sensors fitted to the system have been obtained commercially but one sensor (a multi-band transmissometer for measuring water colour) has been designed and built in the IFE.  

The project was divided into the following distinct work phases:

· design and construction of the instruments in the UK;
· testing of the three variants of the prototype systems in a series of UK lakes;
· deliverance of operational versions of the system for deployment in two lakes in Spain and two lakes in Ireland"
235,1214,Maidstone Town Ctre Management Initiative c/o Maidstone Borough Council,958620.00,479310.00,"There is increasing concern throughout the EU over the environmental impacts of transport, particularly road traffic, in terms of noise, visual intrusion and air pollution.  At a local level, there are generally concerns about the environmental impact of transport but also the economic implications of addressing these impacts. This project will allow different transportation techniques to be tested and measures implemented to reduce road traffic pressures and promote alternative means of transport to the private car whilst maintaining the town¿s commercial vitality.

The aim of the MIST project was to demonstrate whether a mix of environmental and commercial objectives could be achieved through an integrated management structure involving a public and private sector partnership.  The objectives set initially related to a reduction in private commuter car traffic, an increase in the share of public transport , a self sufficient local public transport network, and a maintained or enhanced level of commercial vitality. Targets for the reduction of CO2 and other pollutants were set.

The project required a cooperative and innovative approach involving local authorities, the business community and local passenger transport operators. 

The findings from this project will be particularly relevant to other towns throughout Europe which are medium sized (population approximately 100,000), subject to peak hour traffic congestion, and attempting to manage transport whilst taking account of commercial implications."
236,173,Suffolk Wildlife Trust,1800001.00,1.00,"Although Redgrave and South Lopham fen only covers some 125 ha, it is still the largest of what remains of the calcareous valley fens in England and has long been recognised for its great botanical and entomological significance. It is also a priority habitat type under the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). The entire ecology of the site is dependent on a continuous seepage of calcareous ground water. However two relatively recent events have brought about an important hydrological disruption. One was the sinking of an abstraction borehole in the 1960s, the other was the deep dredging of the River Waveney which surrounds the fen on two sides. As a result, the site has been progressively drying out over the 20 years prior to project inception, and had reached the stage where it would have disappeared completely without immediate intervention. Another threat is nutrient enrichment: the catchment contains about 1 100 ha of intensively-managed farmland, and fens need ultra low fertility conditions.  Concern for the long-term future of this important site led a consortium of conservation bodies, public authorities and private companies to propose an immediate rescue plan under the LIFE Programme."

The process is unique in that the retained contaminants are rejected from the soft membrane by a proprietary gas backwash. This backwash ensures the maintenance of filtration rates and final effluent quality.  Feed to the system will be raw sewage from the villages of Aberporth and Tresaith and will be predominantly domestic in nature.  This sewage is, at present, discharged untreated through short outfalls into Cardigan Bay.  The technology is expected to treat effluent to a standard above that required by the EC Bathing Water Directive.  Prior to the membrane process the raw feed must be treated to remove large solids and to reduce the suspended solids load; this will be achieved by a preliminary screening step and by a very compact lamella settling process.  Settled sewage passes through the screen to the feed tank; screened effluent is then pumped to the microfiltration units.  The feed flow passes through the microporous hollow fibres within each membrane module.  Solids, bacteria, viruses and precipitated phosphorous are retained at the membrane wall whilst clean filtrate passes through to the centre of the fibres.  The total filtrate flow then passes under gravity to the discharge point of the plant."

241,1333,Albright and Wilson Ltd.,6228421.00,1868526.30,"One waste stream arising from the manufacture of purified acid is an acid containing impurities from the ¿green¿ acid. This impure acid, known as raffinate, contains traces of a number of heavy metals. The method preferred by the United Nations and other authorities for the disposal of this waste stream has been discharge to sea. This project aims to remove toxic and nutrient emissions from this waste stream at a discharge point into the Irish Sea. The measures proposed would radically reduce the concentrations of trace metals in the effluent discharge.

The process developed and implemented by Albright and Wilson requires neutralisation  of the raffinate with quicklime to lock the heavy metals in an inert solid of similar crystalline structure to natural phosphate rock.  The process fastens the metal in a hydroxyapatite lattice. The waste is delivered as granules, with one tonne of raffinate producing approximately 1.2 tonnes of solidified material, primarily calcium sulphate with some sodium sulphate and calcium hydroxyapatite. Whilst some components will dissolve with prolonged exposure to water, the calcium hydroxyapatite is insoluble.

The objective of the LIFE project was to establish the first commercial scale plant to demonstrate this new process and to achieve a specified set of emission reductions for seven heavy metals discharged into the Irish Sea."
242,634,Somerset County Council - Department of the Environment,1104000.00,552000.00,"The overall aim of this project is to demonstrate the practical use of reedbed technology in improving the quality of the environment.  Two sites of conservation importance were identified for the demonstration. The Somerset Levels and Moors is a nationally and internationally important coastal wetland system, comprising large areas of unimproved grazing marsh which drain into Bridgwater Bay, a Ramsar site and Special Protection Area.  The Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin is the most important peat grazing marsh in France, comprising the valleys of the Vire, Douve, Aure and Taute which discharge into the Baie des Veys, another Ramsar site and SPA. 

The design, physical works and development of the reedbeds has been completed and both sites are now managed as functioning wetlands.  Useful lessons have been learnt about the planting and aftercare of reed and recommendations made about species selection based on the existence of different reed populations.

The majority of management effort is now directed at monitoring the reedbed systems and their impact on the immediate environment.  The systems are testing the capacity of reedbeds to remove high and low levels of pollutants from water entering sensitive environments within an agricultural and an urban context.   Monitoring of the water environment involves an assessment of the treatment efficiency and of the effect of the system on downstream aquatic life.

In addition to monitoring the effects on water quality, the project will also investigate the wildlife potential of large reedbeds managed for water treatment and demonstrate the capacity of such reedbeds to support breeding fish populations and to provide a habitat for rare wetland birds."

Before Spring 1994 this trunk sewer discharged untreated sewage into a nearby bay, well above the low water mark. This project demonstrated the environmental advantages of the reedbeds in treating domestic and industrial waste waters.  The specific environmental issues were to reduce nutrient input to the Forth Estuary, to eliminate a source of organic and trace metal solids, and to provide a wildlife habitat to redress the loss of natural wetlands due to industrial and farming development.

The reedbeds (Phragmites australis) cover an area of 4.4 hectares and use furnace bottom ash, a waste product from the nearby coal-fired power station, as the growing medium.

The project involved an assessment of the efficiency and environmental implications of treating domestic sewage and non-toxic industrial waste waters using reed beds.  Construction of the reed beds was completed in early 1994.  Reed planting started in spring 1994 and was completed in spring 1995.  Domestic sewage was introduced into the beds in June 1995.  Industrial experiments have also commenced in partnership with Scottish Enterprise and promising results have been obtained in trials carried out with distillery effluent.  The reed beds are still maturing and monitoring will continue to confirm the long term efficiency of the system."
245,822,Leicester Environment City Trust Ltd.,5010400.00,1202496.00,"In 1990, Leicester was designated Britain¿s first Environment City. The award recognised both Leicester¿s good track record on environmental issues and its commitment towards the goal of local sustainability. To promote sustainable development, the Environment City project demanded new thinking, new priorities and new ways of working. In particular, as the problems it addressed are created by the combined actions of individuals and organisations across the City, it placed great emphasis on organisations working together in partnership. 

The goal of this project was to work with statutory bodies, businesses, voluntary organisations and individuals to assist in the identification and implementation of practical and achievable projects that would move Leicester towards a model of sustainable urban development.  Following the beginning of LIFE support in 1992, the project worked towards seven main objectives: to create partnership and alliances for sustainable development; to research and disseminate good environmental practice; to share experience through networks and lobby for change; to develop practical Environment City projects; to develop a strategic (Local Agenda 21) vision for Leicester; to develop a local promotional campaign to raise environmental awareness; and to monitor progress towards sustainability.

 As the Environment City initiative in Leicester progressed, new projects were applied. For instance, the role of the Specialist Working Groups (theme-based) changed as experience was gained of their strengths and weaknesses, and Local Agenda 21 provided opportunities to experiment with ways of gaining greater public involvement in decision making. Hence, as well as change on the ground, the Environment City Project has led to a much improved understanding of the process of change."

Europe has lost around two-thirds of these fragile eco-systems.  Those that remain are often threatened by eutrophication from nitrates and agricultural run-off.  Faced with these issues, the Broads Authority undertook a project to develop techniques that could restore lasting water quality and biodiversity in degraded lakes.

The project aimed to increase the understanding of factors controlling the recovery of the Broads and to develop a range of techniques for their restoration.  It focused on research and experimental management for ecological lake restoration, following effective control of nutrient sources in the catchment.  A combination of chemical and biological approaches were assessed to control nutrient releases from lake sediments and to promote grazing by naturally occurring microscopic grazers (Cladocera).  

The specific aims of the project were to investigate: the effectiveness of low doses of iron salts direct to lake sediments to control phosphorus release; ways of establishing aquatic plants in clear water conditions created by biomanipulation; use of temporary fish enclosures in non-isolated broads, stabilising mechanisms in waterplant-dominated broads. A whole lake biomanipulation trial was carried out to test the techniques developed in the pilot phase.

Its significance lies in the close association of wetlands, heather and grass heaths which flourish in semi-continental conditions unique to Britain. There is a mixture of rare steppe, Mediterranean and coastal species (including nine species listed in the annexes of the Birds Directive). Although traditionally these habitats formed part of an integrated system of land use, these practices have since given way to more permanent intensive agricultural practices.

For hundreds of years, Dorset heathland was at the basis of a rural economy. The poor soils, together with such farming practices as pony and cattle grazing, turf cutting and controlled burning, meant that only hardy plants - such as heather, ling and other dwarf shrubs - could survive. This also created a unique environment for a particularly rich variety of species, including - in the United Kingdom - the entire British population of Dartford warbler, and other rare birds such as the nightjar and the woodlark. All six species of native British reptiles, including the Annex IV species sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) and smooth snake (Coronella austriaca), occur within the Dorset heaths. However, once the agricultural practices came to an end, the Dorset heaths lost their economic value and, consequently, declined dramatically over the next century to only 30% of their original surface area.
