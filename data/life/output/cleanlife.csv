This will include seven 'priority' habitat types, such as fixed coastal dunes, ravine and alluvial forests and yew woodlands, raised and blanket bogs and calcareous fens, plus a further 18 habitat types ranging from sea cliffs, heaths and grasslands, to oak and beech woodlands and open mountain habitats. These habitats occur in a series of 20 potential NATURA 2000 sites throughout Wales, for which monitoring programmes and baseline data will be produced. The final output from the work will be a series of publications on the monitoring methodology and training in its application for the benefit of NATURA 2000 site managers elsewhere in the Community.The effectiveness of the Habitats Directive in ensuring the protection of those habitat types and species of European importance listed in its annexes I and II can only be judged if the habitats and species are monitored adequately. While there already exists some experience on the monitoring of a range of habitat types, no work has, as yet, been undertaken to develop standards for monitoring in support of the Directive. As the network of Special Areas of Conservation (NATURA 2000) will form a vital foundation for the conservation of these habitats and species, it is important that monitoring programmes are developed to determine their favourable conservation status.

Two centuries later, the picture was quite different: heaths covered only 14% of their former range and what remained was torn apart by new land uses – agricultural land, large urban areas and conifer plantations. The 420,000 residents of the Poole - Bournemouth conurbation put particular pressure on the 1850 ha of nearby heaths.  Fires were deliberately set, vegetation was trampled underfoot by people, horses and mountain bikes etc. and many sites were used as illegal dumps to get rid of old rubbish. The public's perception of these habitats was clearly negative: these areas were nothing more than wastelands.
 
Innovative approaches were required to change such attitudes. The heath fragments that remained were so small and vulnerable that there was little benefit in trying to protect them, or introducing classic conservation measures to restore them, without assuring local cooperation. Their status as a habitat of international importance is rarely recognised."

The site includes the botanically richest limestone pavements in the UK, areas of yew-dominated woodland, lime woodlands, juniper stands on limestone, dry limestone grassland, a nutrient-poor lake and a population of Vertigo angustior (narrow-mouthed whorl snail). Removal of limestone pavement stone for decorative use in domestic gardens has been the main threat to these habitats in the past, but there is now also a growing concern about the impact of commercial afforestation with non-native species.  The needle fall and shade of the closing canopy is leading to a significant deterioration of the habitats.  Loss of traditional woodland management practices is also resulting in the gradual decline in species diversity at these sites.  The project proponent and partners have, over the years, already achieved a substantial amount of management and rehabilitation of these habitats, but it was time to give these efforts an important injection of funds to enable the major restoration works to be completed before the tree canopy closed completely."

It covers just over 2 100 hectares, stretching along 19 km of the Merseyside coast from the mouth of the River Mersey estuary to the River Ribble and extending 3 km inland. Important for at least three priority habitat types under the Habitats Directive, it is also home to numerous scarce and threatened species such as the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita), of which it holds 40% of the UK population. In the last few decades, an estimated 40-45% of the original Sefton dune system has been lost to development (including airports, golf courses, housing and road infrastructure). In addition, over half a million visitors use the area for recreational purposes every year. The survival of the remaining sand dune and its component wildlife is therefore dependent upon integrated and sympathetic land use management."

The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. 

First, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.

This LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK.

This project focused on 7 pSCI rivers in different parts of the UK, totalling around 872 km.  Together, they harbour 13 species of Annex I, including such diverse inhabitants as the otter Lutra lutra, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, salmon Salmo salar and freshwater pearl mussel Margaratifera magaratifera.

This LIFE project, run by a partnership of government agencies responsible for water quality and the protection of fresh water habitats, had several objectives.  The primary one was to produce river conservation strategies for each of the seven pilot SAC rivers, as a means of delivering on Article 6.1 of the Habitats Directive. Once established, the strategy would provide a mechanism for initiating conservation actions along each river, in agreement with the local authorities, user groups and landowners. It would also create a model for developing similar strategies on the other pSCI rivers in the UK. 

First, it was important to understand the ecological requirements of the Annex I animals and plants.  New work was undertaken in order to plan and develop conservation objectives for each species and habitat type.  This was supported by practical experiments such as breeding trials of fresh water pearl mussels, the reintroduction of freshwater crayfish into one river, otter studies and vegetation control for the benefit of fish populations.

In the UK, where the breeding population has dropped from a mid-1950s peak of around 80 booming males to 16 in 1994, the RSPB has prepared a recovery plan for bitterns. This project aimed to take key elements of this plan and put them into action so as to safeguard and enhance core areas of UK bittern habitat.

To improve the conservation status of this species in Britain, the project would expand the available breeding habitat and improve habitat quality at 13 sites, mostly in East Anglia - the species' current stronghold - and at one outlying site in north-west England. This would be done in partnership with wetland management agencies in both the public and private sectors.

Activities would specifically protect and enhance reedbed habitats; restore degraded reedbed habitats; and create new reedbeds adjacent to existing areas of this habitat. The expected result would be to provide suitable habitat in Britain to support a bittern population that is 2-3 times higher than at present, although it might take longer than the life of the project before the birds take up residence in their improved habitats.

Habitat loss and deterioration - especially the reduction in Phragmites reedbeds and similar marshlands which are favoured by this large but secretive bird - are among the chief reasons for its general demise, and for its inclusion in Annex I of the Birds Directive. The recent trend to abandon traditional reed management has contributed to the present situation where the haunting, low, booming call of territorial male bitterns is no longer heard, or is heard less frequently, in many lowland wetlands of north-west Europe.

In the UK, where the breeding population has dropped from a mid-1950s peak of around 80 booming males to 16 in 1994, the RSPB has prepared a recovery plan for bitterns. This project aimed to take key elements of this plan and put them into action so as to safeguard and enhance core areas of UK bittern habitat.

To improve the conservation status of this species in Britain, the project would expand the available breeding habitat and improve habitat quality at 13 sites, mostly in East Anglia - the species' current stronghold - and at one outlying site in north-west England. This would be done in partnership with wetland management agencies in both the public and private sectors.

Activities would specifically protect and enhance reedbed habitats; restore degraded reedbed habitats; and create new reedbeds adjacent to existing areas of this habitat. The expected result would be to provide suitable habitat in Britain to support a bittern population that is 2-3 times higher than at present, although it might take longer than the life of the project before the birds take up residence in their improved habitats. Finally, lessons learnt from this project would be shared with other relevant organisations across the EU to assist the implementation of the European bittern action plan."

The project focused on 15 sub-sites altogether covering approximately 40% of the total pSCI (as it was in 1999). These are situated in and around the Kielder Forest which is the largest man made forest in Northern Europe. They are also home to five annex I bird species, such as golden plover Pluvialis apricaria, golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos, and perigrine falcon falco peregrinus which will benefit substantially from the improvements to the quality of the habitat. 

In the past, agricultural drainage and afforestation have encroached onto the blanket bogs and resulted in drying out and degradation of the habitat. However, one positive aspect of the proximity of the forest is that grazing animals have been excluded and burning has not been carried out for over 30 years so much so that the blanket mire has a naturalness that is almost unique in the UK.The project was run by a partnership of government and non-governmental bodies and most of the actions carried were non recurring. Thus, ditches were blocked to reinstate the integrity of the bogs' hydrological systems, trees were cut and removed on some 200ha to enlarge the blanket bog area and finally naturally regenerated trees were removed from open bog. Since the project was also be breaking new ground with mire rehabilitation on previously afforested areas, there was a lot of interest by both forestry and conservation organisations on the project's successes. Two workshops were organised to present the results of the project and to promote further networking both within the UK and in the rest of Europe.

EU-LIFE co-financing provided a vital initial investment for the long term conservation of this unique site. Once the trees are removed and the ditches blocked the natural processes of peat formation will take over and, in time, the blanket bogs will become self sustaining."

When conditions were last assessed in 2008, both of the seabirds covered by the assessment – razorbill (<i>Alca torda</i>) and common guillemot (<i>Uria aalge</i>) – were classified as ‘unfavourable declining’. At present, few biosecurity plans exist for islands such as the Shiants, and no clear best practice guidelines are available. As a result, many key breeding colonies are vulnerable to invasions by alien species, and managers are ill prepared to respond to such invasions.

In addition, the Isles of Scilly contains SSSIs of national importance for vascular plant species, vascular plant associations, breeding shorebirds and lichens. 
Project actions will take place mainly on the islands of St Agnes and Gugh in the southern part of the Scilly SPA. These are two separate islands that are connected by a rock and sand bar at low tide. St Agnes (105 ha) has cultivated farmland at its centre, surrounded by heathland, maritime heath, a few wooded areas and sandy and rocky shores. Gugh (37 ha) has regenerating heathland, maritime heath, marram dunes, a small wooded area and a rocky shoreline. The brown rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) is widespread and abundant on both islands, and was probably introduced as a result of shipwrecks in the 18th century. The presence of brown rats (estimated at 3 300 individuals) is responsible for the loss of adults, young and eggs of both the main target bird species within the Isles of Scilly site, and is therefore affecting the population sizes and distributions of these species."

Reputedly the largest spit in Europe, it is also a haven for birds: nearly 40 species breed, migrate or winter over in the area, of which 12 are in Annex I of the Birds Directive. 

It is not just the birds that are attracted to this remote and isolated area. Apart from having stimulated folklore, artists, musicians and poets over the centuries, the place was also a strategically important military site. Owned by the Ministry of Defence until 1973, it was primarily used for military research purposes, including bomb ballistics and firing trials. These all took their toll on the habitats and birds and even today extensive military debris is evident over much of the area. After 1973, unlawful access and activities spread unchecked across the site, resulting in a further dramatic and steady decline in many of the bird species.

This reached such a critical stage that immediate intervention was needed to conserve and restore the area. Having purchased the site in 1994, the National Trust successfully carried out a first series of emergency actions under a LIFE I project (LIFE94NAT/UK/000850), including the large scale removal of all harmful military debris.

However, in recent decades numbers have declined to around 15% of previous levels. Though present throughout most of the river catchment, salmon are unable to survive in its strongly acidic headwaters. Many of the problems affecting the health of the overall river system arise in the uplands of mid-Wales. These lead to highly acidic streams, flash floods, siltation, over-shading by trees and pesticide pollution downstream, which adversely impact fish and other Habitats Directive listed species. While individual problems are well-understood, it is only by addressing them at the catchment level that real improvements in water and habitat quality can be achieved."

It is probably best known as an area of ancient woodland and swathes of 'open forest' grazed by roaming herds of New Forest ponies. Its EU nature conservation interest lies in its 13 habitat types (including the priority habitats bog woodland and alluvial forests) and 3 species of the Habitats Directive and the 5 Annex I Birds Directive species present.  Situated in the densely populated south of England, the New Forest is a magnet to visitors - estimated at 20 million annually. This popularity brings with it problems: recreational pressure causes erosion and disturbance. Afforestation with non-indigenous species leaves a legacy of conifer plantations that are out of keeping with the natural character of the area. Other invasive species like bracken and rhododendron threaten its integrity. 

A Strategy for the New Forest, which was published by the New Forest Committee in April 1996, recognised the European importance of the New Forest and identified a strategic framework for its conservation and enhancement. The LIFE project grew from this initiative.

A consortium of 10 organisations - from graziers and foresters to conservationists - put together an ambitious programme to undertake a wide range of habitat management and restoration measures designed to tackle the key threats to the New Forest. The main targets were to produce a management plan to cover the entire pSCI; to increase the land owned and managed for nature conservation purposes; and to restore 4000 ha of the pSCI habitats to favourable conservation status. Much of the habitat restoration work would involve clearance of rhododendron, removal of planted and invasive conifers, introducing traditional broadleaved woodland management (like pollarding), and repairing/controlling erosion. One of the more innovative elements of the project was the action to secure the long term viability of grazing animals in the New Forest. Since much of the nature conservation interest is bound up with traditional grazing practices - ponies, cattle and pigs - it is important that these should not decline. New Forest pony grazing is thought to be most at risk and project activities thus focused on stock improvement through incentive payments linked to competitions and stock management by pony owners."

Their nature conservation importance has been reflected in the large number of upland sites proposed as candidate SACs for Scotland. However, the majority of these sites are threatened by overgrazing from domestic sheep and wild herbivores.

A distinctive feature of these mature forests is the 'granny pines' with their thick knarled trunks and large canopies, some of which are over 400 years old. Unlike the commercial pine plantations we see nowadays, these ancient forests support a very rich diversity of animals and plants which makes them a priority habitat under the EU Directive. However, the forests have, over the centuries, sustained a massive reduction through a combination of socio-economic and natural causes and, today continue to suffer from overgrazing, burning and mismanagement. High populations of red deer, in particular, are a serious obstacle to their natural regeneration. With no more than 1% of their original range left and much of this is in a degraded, senescent and isolated state of low regenerative capacity, a concerted effort of both government and non-governmental organisations is vital if the remaining stands are to be brought back to a level that makes them viable in the long term."

They require very specific climatic conditions - persistently wet and cool - in order to allow the growth of Sphagnum rich vegetation which is usually only found on the fringes of large oceans at high latitude. The Flow Country in North Scotland is a prime location for this priority habitat. At 400 000 ha, it is the largest single expanse of blanket bog in Europe, and possibly in the world. Other significant areas within the United Kingdom are found in Northern Ireland, where Cuilcagh mountain, which extends over 5000 ha along the border with the Republc of Ireland, is one of the most important sites for conservation. The threats facing blanket bogs include drainage, burning, overgrazing, peat extraction and forestry.  These are widespread, numerous and not easily controlled, primarily because of the nature of the damaging operations, the remoteness of the sites and the large areas over which they occur. Moreover, peatland habitats are particularly sensitive to hydrological changes brought about by drainage for agricultural improvement, forestry and peat extraction. Lack of control over these activities is a key conservation problem which requires immediate action if the remaining habitats are not to be lost or further degraded."

It is also a priority habitat type under the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). The entire ecology of the site is dependent on a continuous seepage of calcareous ground water. However two relatively recent events have brought about an important hydrological disruption. One was the sinking of an abstraction borehole in the 1960s, the other was the deep dredging of the River Waveney which surrounds the fen on two sides. As a result, the site has been progressively drying out over the 20 years prior to project inception, and had reached the stage where it would have disappeared completely without immediate intervention. Another threat is nutrient enrichment: the catchment contains about 1 100 ha of intensively-managed farmland, and fens need ultra low fertility conditions.  Concern for the long-term future of this important site led a consortium of conservation bodies, public authorities and private companies to propose an immediate rescue plan under the LIFE Programme."
